      VX15/2503-N-131 is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study of VX15/2503 in subjects with late prodromal and early manifest Huntington's disease.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of monthly IV administration
      of a single dosage of VX15/2503 (or placebo). Efficacy endpoints include determining the
      effect of VX15/2503 on brain volumes (MRI), FDG-PET imaging, 11C-PBR28 (TSPO) PET imaging
      (subset of Cohort B only) and clinical features of HD including cognition, motor function,
      behavior, functional abilities, global function and global measurement of change. Additional
      endpoints include PK / PD, immunogenicity, and exploratory biomarkers. Subjects in Cohort B
      that have received 12 months of VX15/2503 who volunteer will undergo a lumbar puncture at V13
      to collect cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to evaluate VX15/2503 mAb concentrations, total
      sSEMA4D levels, and other biomarkers in their CSF. Enrollment will involve approximately 276
      individuals who are 21 years of age or older with late prodromal (CAG-age product score (CAP
      score) of greater than 200 and Diagnostic Confidence Level (DCL) of 2 or 3) or early manifest
      HD (Total Functional Capacity (TFC) greater than or equal to 11). The study will be divided
      into Cohort A and Cohort B. Cohort A is now complete and an unblinded analysis has been
      performed. Cohort A subjects were treated for 6 months with either drug or placebo (1:1) and
      then all subjects were treated with drug for 6 months, followed by 3 months of follow up.
      Treatment duration for each subject in Cohort A was 12 months. Participation in Cohort A
      included a Screening visit, a Baseline visit within 30 days of screening; 12 monthly
      treatment visits beginning at baseline and continuing through Month 12; follow-up safety
      phone call at one month and a follow-up safety visit three months after the final infusion.
      Cohort A subjects participated in the study for approximately 16 months. Based on the
      analysis of Cohort A, it was decided to extend the duration of treatment for a subset of
      subjects in Cohort B to evaluate the clinical response to VX15/2503 after 36 months.
      Additional enrolled subjects in Cohort B will be treated with drug or placebo (1:1).
      Participation in Cohort B will include a Screening visit, a Baseline visit within 30 days of
      screening; 18 or 36 monthly visits beginning at baseline and continuing through Month 18 or
      Month 36; follow-up safety phone call or visit, and for a subset of subjects, a follow-up
      safety visit three and six months after the final infusion. Cohort B subjects will
      participate in the study for approximately 19 and up to 37 months.

               1. An implant/device/condition that is contraindicated for MRI (e.g. pacemaker,
                  severe claustrophobia, prosthetic heart valve, any metal fragments in the eyes or
                  body--in some cases, an X-ray may be needed before an MRI scan, to ensure it is
                  safe to enter the scanner).

               2. Body habitus that would impede completion of MRI scan. (Subject weight above 158
                  kg should be discussed with the Medical Monitor).

             NOTE: If PET is done on PET-MRI all the above conditions apply for PET-MRI.

             exceeds institutional guidelines in the prior year if applicable.

         17. Are undergoing a LP for CSF collection and have any of the following conditions:
             uncorrected bleeding or clotting disorders, skin infections near the site of the LP,

             anesthetics), acute spinal trauma, history of migraines.

         18. Are undergoing a LP for CSF collection and taking any of the following types of
             anticoagulants: coumarins and indandiones, Factor Xa inhibitors, heparins, or thrombin
