    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of followup (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
