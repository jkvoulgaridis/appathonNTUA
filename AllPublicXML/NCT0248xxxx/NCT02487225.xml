  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects (good and bad) of giving a drug called
      pentoxifylline to patients with acute pancreatitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized to either the treatment group (Pentoxifylline medication) or the
      control group (Placebo).

      Participant took a pill orally, starting from the time of admission. Participants received a
      total of 9 doses over the three days of hospitalization (72 hours).

      Research blood draws were done at baseline and on 5 successive days or until the time of
      discharge, whichever occured earlier. The study gathered clinical follow up information up to
      4 months following hospitalization regarding the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in C-reactive Protein (C-RP) From Admission Baseline at One Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), day 5</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein is a substance produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Normal C-RP levels are below 3.0 mg/L.Units: mg/L</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) Levels From Admission Baseline at One Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha is a cell signaling protein (cytokine) involved in systemic inflammation and is one of the cytokines that make up the acute phase reaction. TNF is important to the body because it helps regulate the response of the immune system to a foreign object, especially to the present cancerous tumor. It promotes inflammation, produces other cells used in the inflammatory response, and can help cells heal. The normal range is 5 to 27.2 pg/ml.Units: pg/ml</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Levels From Admission Baseline at One Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be used to help evaluate a person who has a condition associated with inflammation, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or with infection, such as sepsis. It may also be used in the evaluation of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. IL-6 is a cytokine, a protein produced by immune cells that acts on other cells to help regulate and/or promote an immune response. It also stimulates the production of acute phase reactants, proteins that increase in the blood with conditions that cause inflammation or tissue injury. Circulating IL-6 can be found in the blood of normal individuals in the 1 pg/mL range, with slight elevations during the menstrual cycle, modest elevations in certain cancers (melanoma) (10 pg/mL), and large elevations after surgery (30-430 pg/mL).Units: pg/ml</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Levels From Admission Baseline at One Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Admission (baseline), day 5</time_frame>
    <description>IL-8 is a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils, and T-cells, but not monocytes. It is also involved in neutrophil activation. It is released from several cell types in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Units: pg/mL</description>

    <description>Pentoxifylline is a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), activates protein kinase A (PKA), inhibits Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. In addition, pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability (known as a haemorrheologic effect), reduces blood viscosity and decreases the potential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.Pentoxifylline is also an antagonist at adenosine 2 receptors</description>

          <description>Sepsis is an infection which as evoked a systemic inflammatory response. Clinically, the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is identified by two or more symptoms including fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea and change in blood leucocyte count. Measurements are made on a scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe failure symptoms.</description>

        <description>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be used to help evaluate a person who has a condition associated with inflammation, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or with infection, such as sepsis. It may also be used in the evaluation of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. IL-6 is a cytokine, a protein produced by immune cells that acts on other cells to help regulate and/or promote an immune response. It also stimulates the production of acute phase reactants, proteins that increase in the blood with conditions that cause inflammation or tissue injury. Circulating IL-6 can be found in the blood of normal individuals in the 1 pg/mL range, with slight elevations during the menstrual cycle, modest elevations in certain cancers (melanoma) (10 pg/mL), and large elevations after surgery (30-430 pg/mL).Units: pg/ml</description>

        <title>Change in Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Levels From Admission Baseline at One Week.</title>
        <description>IL-8 is a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils, and T-cells, but not monocytes. It is also involved in neutrophil activation. It is released from several cell types in response to an inflammatory stimulus. Units: pg/mL</description>
        <time_frame>Admission (baseline), day 5</time_frame>
        <population>Eighteen (18) of forty-five subjects (45) in the treatment arm and eight (8) of thirty-eight (38) subjects in the placebo arm completed the study. Additionally, subjects had blood collections for 5 days or until dismissal. Many subjects were dismissed at 2-3 days.</population>

            <description>Pentoxifylline, 400 mg, 3 times daily by mouth from time of enrollment until 72 hours from enrollment. Subjects to receive up to a maximum of 9 doses.
Pentoxifylline: Pentoxifylline is a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), activates protein kinase A (PKA), inhibits TNF and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. In addition, pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability (known as a haemorrheologic effect), reduces blood viscosity and decreases the potential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.Pentoxifylline is also an antagonist at adenosine 2 receptors</description>
