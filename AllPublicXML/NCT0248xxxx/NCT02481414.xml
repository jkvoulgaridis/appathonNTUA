  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a human papilloma virus (HPV)
      therapeutic vaccine called PepCan (HPV 16 E6 peptides combined with Candida skin testing
      reagent called Candin®) in adult females over a 12 month time period. As the results from the
      Phase I trial demonstrated some efficacy against non-16 HPV types, Candin alone will also be
      tested. Therefore, there will be two treatment arms: (1) PepCan and (2) Candin. Subjects
      found to be eligible for vaccination will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion at a 1:1
      ratio. Each participant will be receiving injections four times with three weeks between
      injections. Clinical and virological responses will be assessed at 6 and 12 months. Safety
      will be assessed from the time of enrollment to 12 Month Visit. Immunological assessments
      will be made at 4 time points (prevaccination, after 2 injections, 6 month after 4 injections
      and 12 months after 4 vaccinations).

      This is a single site Phase II clinical trial of PepCan for treating women with biopsy-proven
      HSILs (High Grade Intraepithelial Lesions) randomized and double-blinded to two treatment
      arms. Half of the subjects will receive PepCan, and the other half will receive Candin®
      alone. The study design closely resembles the latest guidelines for treating young women with
      HSIL [14]. Study subjects will be patients attending the UAMS Obstetrics and Gynecology
      Clinics with untreated biopsy-proven HSILs and patients referred from other clinics. Four
      injections (one every 3 weeks) of PepCan or Candin® will be intradermally administered in the
      extremities. Clinical response will be assessed by comparison of colposcopy-guided biopsy
      results obtained prior to vaccination and at 12-Month Visit. Safety will be monitored from
      the time of enrollment through the 12-Month Visit. Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing
      and immunological analyses (&quot;blood test&quot;) prior to injection, after the second vaccination, 6
      months after the fourth vaccination, and 12 months after the fourth vaccination. Blood will
      be drawn to aid T-cell analyses (&quot;blood draw&quot;) after the first and third vaccinations, and
      possibly at the Optional Follow-Up and/or Optional LEEP visits. HPV-DNA testing will be
      performed at Screening and 6- and 12-Month Visits (Fig. 6). If a subject has persistent HSIL
      at the 12-Month Visit or if a subject is withdrawn due to excessive toxicity, she will be
      given an option to return for a LEEP visit. Alternatively, she may choose to exit the study
      and be followed by a gynecologist for up to 2 years of observation as recommended before
      surgical treatment

    <description>clinical response will be assessed by obtaining colposcopy-guided quadrant biopsies at the 12 Months Visit. If, upon the 12 Months Visit biopsy, a subject does not have any evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, she would be considered a &quot;responder&quot;. Some would have regressed to CIN 1, and others may have no dysplasia. If there is still CIN 2 and/or 3 present at the 12 Months Visit, the subject will be considered a &quot;non-responder&quot;.</description>
