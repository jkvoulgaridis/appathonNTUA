  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, multicenter, multinational, double-blind study comparing the efficacy
      and safety of plazomicin compared with meropenem followed by optional oral (PO) therapy in
      the treatment of cUTI, including AP, in adults.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Composite of Microbiological Eradication and Clinical Cure in the Microbiological Modified ITT (mMITT) Population at Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological eradication was defined as a urine culture that showed the pathogen found at baseline at ≥10^5 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) was reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL. Clinical Cure at Day 5: marked improvement evidenced by complete resolution or return to premorbid levels or reduction in severity of all core baseline symptoms with worsening of none, and no new symptoms developed. Failure: Lack of improvement in core baseline symptoms of cUTI or development of new core symptoms of cUTI; adverse event (AE) requiring the discontinuation of study drug and the patient required alternative non-study antibiotic therapy for the current cUTI. Indeterminate: Insufficient data are available to allow an evaluation of clinical outcome for any reason.</description>

    <description>Microbiological eradication was defined as a urine culture that showed the pathogen found at baseline at ≥10^5 CFU/mL was reduced to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 32</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered to be drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and it does not imply any judgment about causality. Adverse events also include the exacerbation or worsening of a condition present at screening other than the index infection for which the patient was enrolled in the study. A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study drug.</description>

Clinical Cure TOC: Complete resolution or return to premorbid levels of core symptoms of cUTI and no new symptoms develop, and no use of non-study antibiotic therapy for the current cUTI. Failure TOC: Persistence of one or more core symptom of infection or reappearance of or development of new core symptoms that require alternative non-study antibiotic therapy for the current cUTI.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered to be drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and it does not imply any judgment about causality. Adverse events also include the exacerbation or worsening of a condition present at screening other than the index infection for which the patient was enrolled in the study. A TEAE is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study drug.</description>
