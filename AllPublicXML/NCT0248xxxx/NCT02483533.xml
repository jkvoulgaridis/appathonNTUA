    <textblock>
      LIPO-202-CL-23 is a follow-on study to evaluate the post-treatment safety and duration of
      clinical effect of LIPO-202 in subjects that completed either the LIPO-202-CL-18
      (NCT02397499) or LIPO-202-CL-19 (NCT02398188). No risks related to treatment are anticipated
      as subjects will not receive additional treatment with LIPO-202 or Placebo for LIPO-202 in
      this follow-on study.
