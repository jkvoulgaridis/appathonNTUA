    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the potential of the epigenetic agent RRx-001 to sensitize
      patients who previously received and now have failed a platinum based doublet regimen.
      RRx-001 is administered with autologous blood once weekly followed by or in combination with
      reintroduction of platinum-based doublet therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, four 'cohort' study for administration of RRx-001 with autologous
      blood once weekly followed by or in combination with reintroduction of platinum-based doublet
      therapy according to the treatment schedule listed below. Small cell carcinoma and ovarian
      cohort participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, respectively. Neuroendocrine
      and NSCLC patients will be enrolled to single arms.

      Participants with SCC will receive one of the following; RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet
      chemotherapy or platinum based chemotherapy alone. HGNEC, RRx-001 followed by platinum
      doublet chemotherapy. NSCLC, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy. Participants
      with Platinum Refractory/Resistant Ovarian and MMMT will receive one of the following,
      RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.

      Approximately 213 participants will be enrolled.

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic:

               -  Resistant/Refractory Small Cell Carcinoma (SCC) patients in 3rd line or beyond
                  that have previously received platinum or patients in 2nd line with
                  platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant disease

               -  EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has previously received a
                  first line platinum doublet and all applicable EGFR TKIs

               -  Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer and
                  Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumor (MMMT) of the ovary or uterus. Excludes other
                  non-epithelial ovarian tumors and ovarian tumors with low malignant potential.
                  Patients must have previously received a platinum based regimen for
                  advanced/metastatic disease or have platinum resistant or refractory disease
                  defined as relapse within 6 months. EOC - specific criteria: Patients who
                  progress or have stable disease during first-line treatment or who relapse within
                  1 month are considered to be 'platinum-refractory'. Patients who respond to
                  primary treatment and relapse within 6 months are considered
                  'platinum-resistant', and patients who relapse more than 6 months after
                  completion of initial therapy are characterized as 'platinum-sensitive'. Patients
                  who relapse 6-12 months following the end of their initial regimen are classified
                  as 'partially sensitive'. Platinum sensitive patients may be enrolled but must
                  have failed or declined all other lines of FDA approved therapy

               -  High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (HGNEC), any organ of origin, including a
                  pathology of neuroendocrine features, in patients previously been treated with
                  chemotherapy Although neuroendocrine tumors may be classified differently based
                  on organ of origin, in the context of this protocol they are defined as high
                  grade on the basis of either

                    1. Aggressive clinical behavior requiring previous treatment with chemotherapy
                       even if histologic features such as the Ki67 index or mitotic rate
                       corresponds with low or intermediate grade.

                    2. Histologic features: (a) Neuroendocrine tumors of lung origin are considered
                       high grade if in any part of the tumors, there are &gt;10 mitoses/2mm2 or 10
                       high power field (HPF). Large zones of necrosis are usually present. This
                       includes small cell lung carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine lung
                       carcinoma. [SCLC will not enroll in the HGNEC cohort.] (b)Neuroendocrine
                       tumors of gastroenteropancreatic origin are considered high grade if in any
                       part of the tumors there are either &gt;20 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field
                       (HPF) OR Ki67.

          -  Radiographically measurable disease by RECIST v1.1

          -  A washout period of 3-weeks from last treatment.

          -  Patients must have previously received a platinum based regimen for
             advanced/metastatic disease and progressed or have platinum resistant or refractory
             disease defined as relapse within 6 months.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below both prior
             to administration of RRx-001 and prior to administration of platinum doublet based
             regimen:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL (non-transfused platelet count)

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 x the upper limit of normal

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.0 x the upper limit of normal or &lt;3.0 xULN if patient has a
                  history of Gilbert's syndrome

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤5 X institutional upper limit of normal if with liver

             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90
             days following completion of therapy.

               -  Note: A woman of child-bearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual
                  orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice)
                  who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral
                  oophorectomy; or Has not been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months

             doses of steroids)

          -  History of needing to permanently discontinue prior platinum doublet-based regimen for
             toxicity (e.g., cisplatin causing renal impairment, ototoxicity, or severe
             neuropathy).

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to the platinum agent (i.e., carboplatin or cisplatin)
             or prior partner of platinum agent (i.e., etoposide for SCC and HGNEC; nab-paclitaxel,
             paclitaxel, or pemetrexed for NSCLC; paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin,
             docetaxel or gemcitabine for ovarian) planned for the platinum therapy period. If the
             patient has had prior hypersensitivity reaction to the drug partner of platinum, a
             patient may enroll as long as it is acceptable to treat with platinum and one of the
             alternative chemotherapy partner agents.

          -  Any significant medical diseases or conditions, as assessed by the investigators and
             sponsor that would substantially increase the medical risks of participating in this
             study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA II-IV congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction within 6 months of study, severe chronic pulmonary disease or active
             uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled or clinically relevant pulmonary edema).
