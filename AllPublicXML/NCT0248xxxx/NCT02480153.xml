    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PF-06410293 and adalimumab
      in combination with methotrexate in subjects with moderately to severly active rheumatoid
      arthritis who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate.

      In an additional optional portion of the study, during open label Treatment Period 3 (TP3), a
      subset of subjects used a Prefilled Pen (PFP) to administer up to 3 injections of their study
      treatment (PF-06410293) at home.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 26 (pre-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. Higher score indicate more disease activity. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L).</description>

The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. Higher score indicate more disease activity. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI): Period 1</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 as &quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 as &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Any activity that required assistance from another individual or required the use of an assistive device would adjust to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. Overall score was computed as the sum of scores divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 as &quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 as &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Higher score indicate more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

          <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 as &quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 as &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Any activity that required assistance from another individual or required the use of an assistive device would adjust to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. Overall score was computed as the sum of scores divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 as &quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 as &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;.

        <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty was scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 as &quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 as &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Any activity that required assistance from another individual or required the use of an assistive device would adjust to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. Overall score was computed as the sum of scores divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 as &quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 as &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 as &quot;unable to do&quot;. Higher score indicate more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score-28 (4 Components Based on High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) (DAS28-4 [CRP]): Period 1</title>
        <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. Higher score indicate more disease activity. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L).</description>

DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. Higher score indicate more disease activity. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L).</description>

        <description>EULAR response was based on DAS28 EULAR response criteria. Good response was achieved if DAS28 improvement from baseline &gt;1.2 and DAS28 =&lt;3.2. Moderate response was achieved if DAS28 improvement from baseline &gt;0.6 to =&lt;1.2 and DAS28 =&lt;5.1; or DAS improvement from baseline &gt;1.2 and DAS28 &gt;3.2. No response was achieved if DAS improvement from baseline =&lt;0.6 (no matter present DAS28 score); or DAS improvement from baseline &gt;0.6 to =&lt;1.2 and DAS28 &gt;5.1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving Disease Activity Score Remission (DAS &lt;2.6): Period 1</title>
        <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L). Higher score indicate more disease activity; DAS28-4 (CRP) &lt;2.6 indicates remission.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving Disease Activity Score Remission (DAS &lt;2.6): Period 3</title>
        <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to each component. The components of the DAS28-4 (CRP) assessment included: tender joint count with 28 joints assessed, swollen joint count with 28 joints assessed, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated as 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 ln(CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (PGA [mm]) + 0.96. The possible lowest score is 0.96. The possible highest score is difficult to be determined, due to indeterminable nature of hs-CRP level; assuming hs-CRP level is 0 to 500 mg/L, the possible highest score would be 6.8 (when hs-CRP is 0) to 9.04 (when hs-CRP is 500 mg/L). Higher score indicate more disease activity; DAS28-4 (CRP) &lt;2.6 indicates remission.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Treatment Related TEAEs: Period 3</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs for Period 3 were events between first dose of study drug in Period 3 and up to Week 92 visit that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to prior state. Treatment-related TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
