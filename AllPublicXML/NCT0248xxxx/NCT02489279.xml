  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of different types of cognitive training
      on attention in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using mobile
      software on personal mobile devices.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different types of software-based cognitive training are thought to impact attention via
      different mechanisms. This study examines the nature of the effects on sustained attention of
      two different types of mobile software based training. Because the nature of the training
      method is behavioral, the investigators can not divulge the differences in the training
      methods and their hypothesized differences in their impact on attention.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) RT Variability Scaled Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change was calculated as the score after 10 weeks of treatment minus the pre-treatment score at Baseline. This is a computerized continuous performance task yielding a measure of reaction time (RT) variability over the duration of the task as an assessment of sustained attention control. Less variability in RT is a sign of better sustained attention control. The scaled scores are T Scores and the range is 0-100. Smaller values represent better performance (i.e. lower variability). Consequently, a negative difference value (Post-Pre) indicates improvement. This measure directly addresses the training target, inconsistent control of sustained attention (the variability in RT over time), and is highly correlated with ADHD.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nelson-Denny Reading Test - Comprehension Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change was calculated as the score after 10 weeks of treatment minus the pre-treatment score at Baseline. The Nelson Denny Reading Comprehension test is a time-limited (20-minute) measure of an important daily life activity that is impaired in ADHD, and impacted by poor sustained attention. The score range is from 0-76 with larger values representing better performance. A larger positive difference value (Post- Pre) indicates an improvement in reading comprehension.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale (ASRS) - Inattentive Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change was calculated as the score after 10 weeks of treatment minus the pre-treatment score at Baseline. The ASRS is a scale to evaluate ADHD symptoms in adults. The Inattentive Symptoms Subscale range = 0-36. Higher values are worse. Consequently, a negative difference value indicates improvement.</description>

          2. History of any general medical condition likely to require chronic use of medication
             with identified Central Nervous System (CNS) effects suspected to alter cognitive
             performance

          3. History of seizure disorder, brain tumor, other major neurological disorder or head
             injury resulting in loss of consciousness

          4. Serious oxygen deprivation

        <title>Change From Baseline in Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) RT Variability Scaled Score</title>
        <description>Change was calculated as the score after 10 weeks of treatment minus the pre-treatment score at Baseline. This is a computerized continuous performance task yielding a measure of reaction time (RT) variability over the duration of the task as an assessment of sustained attention control. Less variability in RT is a sign of better sustained attention control. The scaled scores are T Scores and the range is 0-100. Smaller values represent better performance (i.e. lower variability). Consequently, a negative difference value (Post-Pre) indicates improvement. This measure directly addresses the training target, inconsistent control of sustained attention (the variability in RT over time), and is highly correlated with ADHD.</description>

        <description>Change was calculated as the score after 10 weeks of treatment minus the pre-treatment score at Baseline. The Nelson Denny Reading Comprehension test is a time-limited (20-minute) measure of an important daily life activity that is impaired in ADHD, and impacted by poor sustained attention. The score range is from 0-76 with larger values representing better performance. A larger positive difference value (Post- Pre) indicates an improvement in reading comprehension.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale (ASRS) - Hyperactive Subscale</title>
        <description>Change was calculated as the score after 10 weeks of treatment minus the pre-treatment score at Baseline. The ASRS is a scale to evaluate ADHD symptoms in adults. The Hyperactive Symptoms Subscale range = 0-36. Higher values are worse. Consequently, a negative difference value indicates improvement.</description>
