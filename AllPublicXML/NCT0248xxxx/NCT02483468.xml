  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of cognitive-behavioral
      therapy in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation in (1) improving pain and
      functionality, (2) reducing severity of opioid use disorders, and (3) reducing impairment in
      associated mental health areas (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD, sleep). The investigators
      will also determine the effects of treatment on neural activity in cognitive and limbic brain
      regions involved in pain regulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and
      examine its relationship to opioid use severity.

    <textblock>
      As a result of sustained operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, an increasing number of U.S.
      military personnel and Veterans are in need of effective pain management treatment. Chronic
      low back pain (CLBP) is the most common pain condition among returning Veterans and is
      associated with high levels of opioid analgesic prescribing in VA clinics. Although opioids
      are effective for acute pain, they are not very effective as a long-term treatment strategy.
      Furthermore, opioids are associated with significantly increased risk of misuse, addiction,
      diversion, overdose and death. Consequently, there is a critical need for the development of
      alternative, effective treatments for CLBP that can be implemented in VA-based healthcare
      settings. The proposed study will answer critical questions regarding the ability of
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to augment the effects of cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) for pain, and elucidate possible mechanisms underlying improved outcomes. tDCS
      is inexpensive and highly portable, making it a very scalable tool to add to current CBT
      interventions within the VA healthcare system. This study has the particular advantages of
      building directly on positive preliminary findings among civilians and is being led by a
      multi-disciplinary team of experts who have successfully collaborated in the past and are
      uniquely qualified to implement this type of investigation. The primary objective of the
      proposed Stage II study is to evaluate the effects of CBT in combination with tDCS in (1)
      improving pain and functionality, (2) reducing severity of opioid use disorders, and (3)
      reducing impairment in associated mental health areas (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD,
      sleep). The investigators will also determine the effects of treatment on neural activity in
      cognitive and limbic brain regions involved in pain regulation using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), and examine its relationship to opioid use severity. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate acute lab-based pain markers and neural correlates of improvement
      in chronic pain using quantitative sensory testing. In order to accomplish this the
      investigators are: using a manualized, evidence-based CBT intervention that is already
      widely-disseminated within the VA system; employing a randomized, between-groups,
      double-blind experimental design; and examining standardized, repeated, dependent measures of
      change in: (a) clinical outcomes such as pain, opioid and other substance use disorders
      (e.g., alcohol, illicit drugs, other prescription drugs), depression, anxiety, sleep and PTSD
      symptomatology; and (b) process variables such as participant satisfaction, quality of life
      and treatment retention. The results of this study will provide important information
      regarding two non-pharmacologic, evidence-based interventions (CBT and tDCS), and will help
      inform policies and programs to better serve the needs of U.S. military personnel, Veterans,
      and their families. The findings from this study may help reduce public health costs and
      morbidity/mortality associated with chronic pain and co-morbid prescription opiate use
      disorders among our nation's Veterans.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 18 to 70.

          2. United States Veteran or family member of a Veteran.

          3. Able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual level sufficient to
             allow accurate completion of the assessment instruments.

          4. Subjects must be able to comprehend English.

          5. Have a chronic pain condition and ≥3months duration of pain.

          6. BPI score &gt;4/10.

          7. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current (i.e., past 6 months) prescription opioid use disorder
             (assessed via the MINI 7.0).

          8. COMM score&gt;7.

          9. Subjects may also meet criteria for a mood disorder if asymptomatic or anxiety
             disorders (PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety
             disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder). The inclusion of subjects with affective
             and anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the co-existence
             of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with chronic pain and prescription
             opioid use disorders.

         10. Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable
             dose for at least four weeks before study initiation. This is because initiation or
             change of psychotropic medications during the course of the trial may interfere with
             interpretation of results.

         11. Must consent to random assignment to CBT + tDCS or CBT + sham tDCS.

         12. Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.

         13. Must live within 100 miles of the Medical University of South Carolina.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with symptomatic psychotic/bipolar disorder and/or deemed too high risk by
             the study physician

          2. Subjects with current suicidal or homicidal ideation and intent.

          3. Subjects with a current eating disorder (bulimia, anorexia nervosa) or with
             dissociative identity disorder, as they are likely to require specific time-intensive
             psychotherapy in addition to the proposed therapy for stabilization.

          4. Subjects who would present a serious suicide risk or who are likely to require
             hospitalization during the course of the study.

          5. Subjects enrolled in ongoing behavioral therapy for pain or substance use disorders,
             who are not willing to discontinue these therapies for the duration of the trial.
             Attendance at therapeutic activities other than study sessions will be closely
             monitored using the Treatment Services Review.

          6. Subjects on maintenance anxiolytic, antidepressant, or mood stabilizing medications,
             which have been initiated during the past 4 weeks. If it is determined, based on
             clinical criteria, that a subject needs to be started on maintenance medications for
             anxiety, mood or psychotic symptoms during the course of the study, they will be
             discontinued from the treatment trial.

          7. Subjects with organic mental syndrome.

          8. Pregnant women.

          9. History of seizures.

         10. Implanted medical devices above the waist.

         11. Latex allergy.

         12. Diagnosis of Fibromyalgia.

         13. History of eczema or other sensitive skin conditions.

         14. Known brain tumors or lesions that intersect the area of stimulation.
