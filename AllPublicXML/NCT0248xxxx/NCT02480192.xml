  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the effectiveness of a new cognitive-behavioural therapy for menopausal
      symptoms (CBT-Meno). Half of participants were randomly assigned to the 12-week CBT-Meno
      program and half to a 12-week waitlist. Common menopause symptoms (i.e., hot flashes/night
      sweats, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, and sexual concerns) were assessed at baseline,
      12-weeks post-baseline, and (for women in the CBT-Meno condition) at 3-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women going through the menopausal transition often experience adverse physical changes
      (e.g., hot flashes/night sweats, sleep difficulties, sexual concerns) in addition to
      emotional difficulties (e.g., depression, anxiety) that can significantly impact functioning
      and overall quality of life. To date, hormone therapy (HT) has been the most commonly used
      treatment to relieve symptoms of menopause. However, reports have questioned the safety of HT
      long-term (e.g., risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancer) for some women.
      Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), has been proposed as a low-risk treatment for menopausal
      symptoms. The investigators developed a comprehensive non-pharmacological, CBT for menopausal
      symptoms (CBT-Meno), published the treatment manual (Green, McCabe, &amp; Soares, 2012), and
      obtained initial evidence supporting the effectiveness of CBT-Meno in a single-sample pilot
      study (Green et al., 2013). The goal in the study reported here was to conduct a larger
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CBT-Meno program compared to
      a waitlist condition. The investigators hypothesized that participants would experience less
      intense/disruptive hot flashes/night sweats, reduced depression and anxiety, improvement in
      sleep difficulties, and sexual concerns. The investigators also predicted that these benefits
      would be maintained at 3-month follow-up and that participants would report high treatment
      satisfaction.

They were then re-assessed at 12-weeks post-baseline and this data was used to compare this group to the experimental group to determine the effectiveness of the CBT-Meno treatment. After this re-assessment participants in the waitlist condition were offered the same CBT-Meno treatment as the experimental group: 12 weekly sessions (2 hours long) of cognitive-behavioural therapy for menopausal symptoms.</description>

             vasomotor subscale of the Greene Climacteric Scale); and (c) interfering (≥ 30 or
             greater on the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale).

          4. Not taking hormonal, anti-depressant, or any herbal therapies or if taking these

             written materials in group treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants who are severely depressed/suicidal at the time of the screen or intake
