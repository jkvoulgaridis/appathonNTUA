  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify if there are self-reported or objective measures
      related to mood parameters that can predict near-term relapse (within 1 month or at another
      identified time point before meeting the criteria for relapse) or early symptomatic changes
      indicative of relapse prodrome in major depressive disorder (MDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, single-cohort, observational study in
      participants with MDD who have responded to, and are continuing to respond to and receive, an
      oral antidepressant treatment regimen. The study will consist of 2 parts: a screening phase
      of up to 2 weeks, and an observational phase of variable duration.

    <description>Relapse will be defined as any of the following: a) MADRS total score greater than or equal to 22 on at least two consecutive visits, with an interval of 1-2 weeks; b) Hospitalization for worsening of depression; c) Suicidal ideation with intent, or suicidal behavior and d) Other (investigator will be asked to describe). MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60, Higher scores represents a more severe condition.</description>

             (that is, the start of the most recent major depressive episode (MDE) must be less
             than or equal to 24 Months before screening), as confirmed using the MINI

             adequate dosage and duration based on the Massachusetts General Hospital
             Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire), within the past 3 months. A change
             in the oral antidepressant treatment regimen since the time of achieving response in
             the most recent episode will be allowed

          -  Participants must have a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score less
             than or equal to 14

          -  Participant must be willing and able to complete self-reported assessments via a
             study-specific smartphone, and must be willing to wear an wrist actigraphy device for
             the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of drug or alcohol use, with a severity of at least moderate
             or severe, according to DSM-V criteria, within 6 months before screening

          -  Participant is currently receiving or has received vagal nerve stimulation (VNS),
             electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep
             brain stimulation (DBS) for the most recent MDE

          -  Participant is currently receiving stimulants, anticonvulsants, or mood stabilizers
             for treatment of his or her MDD

          -  Participant is a woman who is pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, while enrolled
