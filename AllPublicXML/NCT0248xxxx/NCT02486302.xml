  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non-interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept during
      routine clinical use over a maximum of 12 months in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
      psoriatic arthritis(PsA), axial spondyloarthritis(axSpA) or plaque psoriasis (PsO). In so
      doing, particular attention will be paid to the proportion of those patients who only attain
      the desired treatment goal after 12 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy end point for
      the study is the proportion of patients who attain the desired treatment goal after 12 and 24
      weeks,

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were measured up to Week 12, 24, 36 and 52 of exposure with study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.

        <description>The PtGA of disease activity was measured on a VAS ranged from 0 mm to 100 mm, where 0 = no disease activity and 100=high disease activity. Participants assessed their fatigue during the last 7 days using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no fatigue and 100 mm = worst possible fatigue. Participants assessed pain using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS where 0 mm = minimum possible pain (best) and 100 mm = maximum possible pain (worst). The PHQ-2 is a brief depression screening instrument and enquire two factors: frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each question on scale of 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Total PHQ-2 ranged from 0-6. PGA disease activity was measured on a 0 mm to 100 mm VAS, with 0 mm = no disease activity and 100mm = maximum possible disease activity. Correlation coefficient between each of these parameters was measured using spearman correlation coefficient and reported.</description>

        <title>Ankylosing Spondylitis (axSpA): Spearman Correlation Coefficient Between Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) of Disease Activity, VAS Fatigue, VAS Pain Score, Patient Health Quessionare-2 (PHQ-2) and PGA of Disease Activity at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52</title>
        <description>The PtGA of disease activity was measured on a VAS ranged from 0 mm to 100 mm, where 0 = no disease activity and 100=high disease activity. Participants assessed their fatigue during the last 7 days using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no fatigue and 100 mm = worst possible fatigue. Participants assessed pain using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS where 0 mm = minimum possible pain (best) and 100 mm = maximum possible pain (worst). The PHQ-2 is a brief depression screening instrument and enquire two factors: frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each question on scale of 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Total PHQ-2 ranged from 0-6. PGA disease activity was measured on a 0 mm to 100 mm VAS, with 0 mm = no disease activity and 100mm = maximum possible disease activity. Correlation coefficient between each of these parameters was measured using spearman correlation coefficient and reported.</description>

        <title>Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): Spearman Correlation Coefficient Between Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) of Disease Activity, VAS Fatigue, VAS Pain Score, Patient Health Quessionare-2 (PHQ-2) and PGA of Disease Activity at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52</title>
        <description>The PtGA of disease activity was measured on a VAS ranged from 0 mm to 100 mm, where 0 = no disease activity and 100=high disease activity. Participants assessed their fatigue during the last 7 days using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no fatigue and 100 mm = worst possible fatigue. Participants assessed pain using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS where 0 mm = minimum possible pain (best) and 100 mm = maximum possible pain (worst). The PHQ-2 is a brief depression screening instrument and enquire two factors: frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each question on scale of 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Total PHQ-2 ranged from 0-6. PGA disease activity was measured on a 0 mm to 100 mm VAS, with 0 mm = no disease activity and 100mm = maximum possible disease activity. Correlation coefficient between each of these parameters was measured using spearman correlation coefficient and reported.</description>

        <title>Plaque Psoriasis (PsO): Spearman Correlation Coefficient Between Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) of Disease Activity, VAS Fatigue, VAS Pain Score, Patient Health Quessionare-2 (PHQ-2) and PGA of Disease Activity at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52</title>
        <description>The PtGA of disease activity was measured on a VAS ranged from 0 mm to 100 mm, where 0 = no disease activity and 100=high disease activity. Participants assessed their fatigue during the last 7 days using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no fatigue and 100 mm = worst possible fatigue. Participants assessed pain using a 0 mm - 100 mm VAS where 0 mm = minimum possible pain (best) and 100 mm = maximum possible pain (worst). The PHQ-2 is a brief depression screening instrument and enquire two factors: frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past 2 weeks, scoring each question on scale of 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Total PHQ-2 ranged from 0-6. PGA disease activity was measured on a 0 mm to 100 mm VAS, with 0 mm = no disease activity and 100mm = maximum possible disease activity. Correlation coefficient between each of these parameters was measured using spearman correlation coefficient and reported.</description>

        <description>FFbH consists 18 questions to assess daily activities in last 7 days. Each question is answered by the participant as &quot;Yes, I can perform the activity without difficulty&quot; (score assigned = 2), &quot;Yes, but with some difficulties&quot; (score assigned = 1) and &quot;No or only with help&quot; (score assigned = 0). Final FFbH score (FFbH functional capacity) was then computed according to formula: (Sum of all single scores * 100% [percent]) / (2 * number of answered questions) ranged between 0-100; higher score indicates better daily activities. Duration of morning stiffness was defined as the time elapsed when participant woke up in the morning and was able to resume normal activities without stiffness in minutes (If none was present = 0; If morning stiffness was continuing at the time of assessment or was unusual compared to the recent past, average of duration of stiffness over the past 3 days was reported; If stiffness persisted the entire day, 1440 minutes [24 hours*60 minutes] was recorded).</description>

        <title>Ankylosing Spondylitis(axSpA): Spearman Correlation Coefficient Between Hannover Functional Questionnaire (FFbH) and Morning Stiffness at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52</title>
        <description>FFbH consists 18 questions to assess daily activities in last 7 days. Each question is answered by the participant as &quot;Yes, I can perform the activity without difficulty&quot; (score assigned = 2), &quot;Yes, but with some difficulties&quot; (score assigned = 1) and &quot;No or only with help&quot; (score assigned = 0). Final FFbH score (FFbH functional capacity) was then computed according to formula: (Sum of all single scores * 100% [percent]) / (2 * number of answered questions) ranged between 0-100; higher score indicates better daily activities. Duration of morning stiffness was defined as the time elapsed when participant woke up in the morning and was able to resume normal activities without stiffness in minutes (If none was present = 0; If morning stiffness was continuing at the time of assessment or was unusual compared to the recent past, average of duration of stiffness over the past 3 days was reported; If stiffness persisted the entire day, 1440 minutes [24 hours*60 minutes] was recorded).</description>

        <title>Hannover Functional Questionnaire (FFbH) Functional Capacity Score of Participants With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA), Psoriasis Arthritis (PsA) at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52</title>
        <description>FFbH consisted 18 questions to assess daily activities in last 7 days. Each question was answered by the participant as &quot;Yes, I can perform the activity without difficulty&quot; (score assigned = 2), &quot;Yes, but with some difficulties&quot; (score assigned = 1) and &quot;No or only with help&quot; (score assigned = 0).

          <description>FFbH consisted 18 questions to assess daily activities in last 7 days. Each question was answered by the participant as &quot;Yes, I can perform the activity without difficulty&quot; (score assigned = 2), &quot;Yes, but with some difficulties&quot; (score assigned = 1) and &quot;No or only with help&quot; (score assigned = 0). Final FFbH score (FFbH functional capacity) was then computed according to formula: (Sum of all single scores * 100% [percent]) / (2 * number of answered questions) ranged between 0-100; higher score indicated better daily activities.</description>

        <description>The DLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): no effect at DLQI &lt; 2; small effect at 2 &lt;=DLQI &lt;= 5; moderate effect at 6 &lt;=DLQI &lt;= 10; very large effect at 11&lt;=DLQI &lt;= 20; extremely large effect at 21 &lt;= DLQI &lt;= 30.</description>
