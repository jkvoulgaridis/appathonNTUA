    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Non-Randomized, Dose-Escalation Study of SPK-9001 in Subjects with
      Hemophilia B.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is a genetic bleeding disorder resulting in the lack of
      ability to produce blood-clotting factor IX (FIX). Individuals with hemophilia B suffer
      repeated bleeding events, which can cause chronic joint disease and sometimes leads to death
      due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently. This chronic joint disease can have
      significant physical, psychosocial, and quality-of-life effects, including financial burden.
      The current treatment is intravenous infusion of FIX protein products, either
      prophylactically or in response to bleeding.

      The approach being tested in this study uses a novel recombinant adeno-associated virus
      (AAV), which in nature causes no disease, to deliver the human factor IX (hFIX) gene to the
      liver cells where FIX is normally made. Recent data of a gene therapy study showed
      preliminary encouraging results with the approach of using an AAV vector carrying the factor
      IX gene. This study will seek to determine the safety and kinetics of a single IV infusion of
      SPK-9001 (a novel AAV vector carrying a high specific activity factor IX variant).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Physical Examination Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Physical examination included examination of the head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. The examination assessed the participants for any potential changes in general appearance, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as towards participant reported symptoms. Findings were considered to be clinically significant based on investigator's decision.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) were obtained with participant in the seated position, after having sat calmly for at least 5 minutes. Clinical significance of vital signs was determined at the investigator's discretion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Reported as TEAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Following parameters were analyzed for laboratory examination: hematology (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count); liver function (albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, GGT); Lipid panel (HDL, VLDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol); clinical chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, phosphate, serum creatinine, BUN); urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, blood, ketones; coagulation, immunology, etc. Investigators determined which laboratory abnormalities were reported as treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Drug -Related TEAEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and AEs. An AE was regarded as TEAE if the start date was on or after the infusion of SPK-9001 but before participant's last visit on study (or the date of withdrawal/the date of being lost to follow-up). Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Positive Immune Reponses Against Adeno-associated Virus Vector (AAV) Capsid</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) results by interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to assess cellular immune responses to AAV capsid and to FIX were presented. The ELISPOT is a type of assay that focuses on quantitatively measuring the frequency of cytokine secretion for a single cell. The positive ELISPOT results suggested a T-cell reaction to capsid protein.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Reached &gt; 150% Vector-derived FIX:C Activity Level After SPK-9001 Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Based on non-clinical studies in non-human primates (NHPs), it was not predicted that vector-derived FIX:C activity levels &gt;150% of normal would be achieved in this study. However, thrombin antithrombin (TAT) levels as thrombotic potential were to be measured if vector derived FIX:C activity levels &gt;150% of normal were achieved in any participant during the study. Blood samples for TAT at Day 0 visit (prior to FIX protein product infusion) were used to establish baseline value.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With FIX Inhibitor</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FIX inhibitors were measured using the Bethesda assay from the central and local laboratory. The Bethesda assay measures the amount of factor (FIX) inactivated when the plasma from the patient is incubated with an external source of factor for 2 hours at 37ºC. Inhibitor levels are quantified in Bethesda units (BU). An inhibitor titer of ≥ 0.6 BU/ml is to be taken as clinically significant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental Recovery of FIX Product</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Incremental recovery was determined as the peak factor level recorded within the first 3 hours after infusion and was reported as (IU/ml)/(IU/kg), using the formula:([Activity IU/mL peak post infusion] - [Activity IU/mL pre-infusion]) / (IU/kg infused).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FIX:C Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>All samples collected from participants for plasma FIX activity levels were analyzed and used to determine peak and steady-state vector-derived circulating FIX activity levels. The vector-derived endogenous (not affected by intercurrent FIX product infusions) FIX:C activity levels were characterized by post-treatment population mean. Dose escalation and dose level expansion strategies were employed in the study based on vector-derived FIX activity levels as well as any immune responses against AAV capsid. Steady-state levels were based on 2 separate vector-derived FIX:C activity level measurements (at least 2 weeks apart) starting from Week 8-12 with adequate washout.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in FIX:C Antigen Level at Steady State</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The vector-derived endogenous (not affected by intercurrent FIX product infusions) FIX:C activity antigen levels were characterized by post-treatment population mean.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and AEs. An AE was regarded as TEAE if the start date was on or after the infusion of SPK-9001 but before participant's last visit on study (or the date of withdrawal/the date of being lost to follow-up). Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With FIX Inhibitor</title>
        <description>FIX inhibitors were measured using the Bethesda assay from the central and local laboratory. The Bethesda assay measures the amount of factor (FIX) inactivated when the plasma from the patient is incubated with an external source of factor for 2 hours at 37ºC. Inhibitor levels are quantified in Bethesda units (BU). An inhibitor titer of ≥ 0.6 BU/ml is to be taken as clinically significant.</description>

        <title>FIX:C Activity</title>
        <description>All samples collected from participants for plasma FIX activity levels were analyzed and used to determine peak and steady-state vector-derived circulating FIX activity levels. The vector-derived endogenous (not affected by intercurrent FIX product infusions) FIX:C activity levels were characterized by post-treatment population mean. Dose escalation and dose level expansion strategies were employed in the study based on vector-derived FIX activity levels as well as any immune responses against AAV capsid. Steady-state levels were based on 2 separate vector-derived FIX:C activity level measurements (at least 2 weeks apart) starting from Week 8-12 with adequate washout.</description>
