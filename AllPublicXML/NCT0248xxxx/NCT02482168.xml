  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1 open-label dose escalation study of the immuno-activating monoclonal
      antibody APX005M in adults with solid tumors. Study is intended to establish the maximum
      tolerated dose and the overall safety and tolerability of APX005M in 3 different
      administration schedules.

    <textblock>
      APX005M-001 is an open-label study and comprises a dose-escalation portion of approximately 8
      dose level cohorts, plus an expansion cohort.

      Eligible subjects with solid tumors will receive intravenous APX005M every 3 week, every 2
      week or every 1 week until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death, whichever
      occurs first.

      Study objectives include:

        -  Evaluate safety of APX005M

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of APX005M

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of APX005M: the maximal drug concentration
           (Cmax), area under the curve of serum concentration over time (Area Under the Curve/
           AUC), and half-life (tÂ½).

        -  Preliminary assessment of clinical response
