  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - MEDI4736 is a drug that may help people s immune systems respond to and kill cancer cells.
      Olaparib is a drug that may inhibit repairing DNA damage of cancer cells. Cediranib is a drug
      that may stop the blood vessel growth of cancer cells. This study has two components. In the
      phase 1 component of the study, researchers want to investigate how well participants
      tolerate the combination of these drugs in treating advanced solid tumors, and in the phase 2
      part of this study, researchers want to study if the combination treatments are effective in
      ovarian cancer.

      Objectives:

      - Phase 2 part of the study: To determine how effective this combination is in treating
      ovarian cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Phase 2 part of the study: Adults age 18 or older with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer
      that has no standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
           tests. They will have CT or MRI scans. For these, they will lie in a machine that takes
           pictures of their bodies.

        -  Phase 2 part of the study requests the participants to have tumor samples removed.

        -  Participants will get MEDI4636 through an IV. A small plastic tube will be inserted into
           a vein. The drug will be given every 4 weeks until disease progression.

        -  Participants will take olaparib or cediranib by mouth every day.

        -  Every 28 days will be 1 cycle. For cycle 1, participants will have 2 study visits. All
           other cycles, they will have 1 visit. At these visits, they will repeat the screening
           procedures.

        -  Patients will keep a drug and diarrhea diary.

        -  Patients on cediranib will monitor their blood pressure and keep a blood pressure diary.

        -  Participants who can become pregnant, or have a partner who can become pregnant, must
           practice an effective form of birth control.

        -  After 12 cycles, participants will have 1-3 months of follow-up.

      Background:

        -  Disruption of the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 pathway yielded clinical activity in
           subsets of advanced solid tumors, such as melanoma and lung cancer.

        -  Olaparib (O), a PARP inhibitor (PARPi), has demonstrated single agent activity in
           recurrent ovarian cancer (OvCa), and subsets of prostate, triple negative breast or lung
           cancers.

        -  Our recent randomized phase 2 study showed that O and cediranib (C), a VEGFR1-3
           inhibitor was clinically superior to O alone in platinum-sensitive recurrent OvCa.

        -  We hypothesize that increased DNA damage by PARP inhibition and/or reduced angiogenesis
           by VEGFR inhibition will complement the anti-tumor activity of an immune checkpoint
           nhibitor, MEDI4736, in recurrent OvCa and other solid tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the safety of doublet
           herapies (MEDI4736/olaparib [MEDI+O] and MEDI4736/cediranib [MEDI+C]) and triplet
           therapy (MEDI+O+C) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Phase II Cohort 1 OvCa; MEDI+O, MEDI+C and MEDI+O+C arms: To determine clinical efficacy
           as measured by overall response rate (ORR)

        -  Phase II Cohort 2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); MEDI+O and MEDI+C arms: To
           determine clinical efficacy as measured by progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Phase II Cohort 3 small cell lung cancer (SCLC); MEDI+O arm: To determine clinical
           efficacy as measured by ORR

        -  Phase II Cohort 4 metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); MEDI+O arm: To
           determine clinical efficacy as measured by PFS

        -  Phase II Cohort 5 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); MEDI+O arm: To determine
           clinical efficacy as measured by ORR

        -  Phase II Cohort 6 colorectal cancer (CRC): C+MEDI arm: To determine clinical efficacy as
           measured by PFS

      Eligibility:

        -  Phase I: Advanced or recurrent solid tumors with evaluable disease.

        -  Phase II Cohort 1 MEDI+O, MEDI+C and MEDI+O+C arms: Advanced or recurrent OvCa

        -  Phase II Cohort 2 MEDI+O and MEDI+C arms: Advanced or recurrent NSCLC

        -  Phase II Cohort 3 MEDI+O arm: Advanced or recurrent SCLC

        -  Phase II Cohort 4 MEDI+O arm: mCRPC

        -  Phase II Cohort 5 MEDI+O arm: Advanced or recurrent TNBC

        -  Phase II Cohort 6 C+MEDI arm: Advanced or recurrent CRC

        -  Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic therapy for at
           least 3 weeks. mCPRC patients (Cohort 4) may be on hormonal therapy with GnRH
           agonists/antagonists.

        -  Adults with ECOG performance status 0-2, and adequate organ and marrow function.

      Design:

           administered once every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks until disease progression. O
           tablets and C will be given orally on a continuous or intermittent dosing schedule. The
           DLT period will be one cycle, 28 days. Patients on the 2-week schedule greater than one
           year will be changed to the 4-week schedule until progression.

             -  MEDI+O: MEDI4736 (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, or a fixed dose of 1500 mg

           will be obtained.

        -  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAEv4.0, and for response
           every two cycles (8 weeks) by RECIST 1.1. Patients with mCRPC (MEDI+O Cohort 4) will be
           evaluated for response initially at 8 weeks then every 12 weeks using RECIST v1.1
           criteria as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2).
