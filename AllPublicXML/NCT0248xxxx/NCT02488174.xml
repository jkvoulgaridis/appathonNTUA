  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is the most
      common form of acute organ dysfunction in the hospital, and is often associated with multiple
      organ failure (MOF), high mortality, and functional impairment. Most studies on ARF have
      focused on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) after they have been on mechanical
      ventilation for days and end organ damage is already established. The overall goal of this
      proposed project is to improve the outcomes of patients at high risk for developing severe
      ARF and prolonged mechanical ventilation in and outside of the ICU. The project aims to
      intervene early in high risk patients with an electronic medical records (EMR)-based,
      patient-centered checklist of common critical care practices aimed at preventing lung injury
      and hospital acquired adverse events that commonly lead to organ failure (Prevention of Organ
      Failure checklist -PROOFcheck). This application proposes a stepped-wedge, clustered
      randomized control trial to determine the utility of PROOFcheck to improve survival and
      reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and multiple organ failure in patients
      identified as high risk for progressing to severe ARF and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
      The aims in the UH2 phase are: 1) to refine a previously validated Lung Injury Prediction
      Score into a pragmatic, EMR-based early prediction model to Accurately Predict Prolonged
      Ventilation (APPROVE), which will automatically identify patients anywhere in the hospital
      who are at high risk for developing severe ARF requiring mechanical ventilation &gt;48 hours; 2)
      to incorporate PROOFcheck into the EMR to prompt clinicians on care practices to limit lung
      injury, prevent adverse events, and avoid additional organ failure; and 3) to establish the
      infrastructure for the proposed trial. The proposed pragmatic trial will harness the
      hospital-wide EMR to identify patients at high risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation with
      APPROVE for intervention with PROOFcheck. As such, the proposed trial aims to break out of
      the clinical silos by which care is currently organized in the hospital and bring
      patient-centered, context appropriate care to the acutely ill patient wherever and whenever
      the patient's condition requires it.

    <description>The intervention for this study will consist of 3 parts: 1) Education of clinicians on prevention of severe ARF and MOF in and out of the ICU, and best practice with regards to patients with severe ARF; 2) Clinicians will be notified that a patient they are taking care of has been identified as being at high risk for developing severe ARF requiring prolong MV; 3) Notified clinicians will be directed to PROOFcheck with a bundle of recommendations for best care for patients with ARF.</description>
