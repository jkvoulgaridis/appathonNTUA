  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are systematic differences between
      the decisions patients make intuitively versus deliberatively about life-sustaining medical
      therapies.

      The targeted population is inpatients at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with
      serious medical problems. The study will involve facilitated interviews with patients using a
      survey instrument developed in Qualtrics.

    <measure>Acceptance or Refusal of a Feeding Tube for Chronic Aspiration</measure>
    <time_frame>The trial involves a questionnaire that will be given on a single day; patients will not be followed longitudinally</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in each arm will be asked all of the same questions. The only difference between the arms will be the instructions regarding how and when to answer the series of hypothetical questions regarding acceptance of a feeding tube for chronic aspiration. In this hypothetical scenario, patients are presented with a situation in which they are unable to eat or drink safely such that small amounts of food or liquid go to their lungs and cause trouble with breathing. The instructions will be designed to influence patients to think either intuitively or deliberatively about the questions regarding life-sustaining interventions. Cognitive load: Patients in the intuition arm of the study will be asked to complete a memorization task while they are answering survey questions.</description>

    <measure>Acceptance or Refusal of Antibiotics</measure>
    <time_frame>The trial involves a questionnaire that will be given on a single day; patients will not be followed longitudinally</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in each arm will be asked all of the same questions. The only difference between the arms will be the instructions regarding how and when to answer the series of hypothetical questions regarding acceptance of antibiotics. In this hypothetical scenario, patients are presented with an illness severity such that they drift in and out of consciousness some days and are expected to die in several months. The instructions will be designed to influence patients to think either intuitively or deliberatively about the questions regarding life-sustaining interventions. Cognitive load: Patients in the intuition arm of the study will be asked to complete a memorization task while they are answering survey questions.</description>

    <measure>Acceptance or Refusal of Breathing Machine</measure>
    <time_frame>The trial involves a questionnaire that will be given on a single day; patients will not be followed longitudinally</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in each arm will be asked all of the same questions. The only difference between the arms will be the instructions regarding how and when to answer the series of hypothetical questions regarding acceptance of a breathing machine. In this hypothetical scenario, patients are presented with a life-threatening illness with 50% chance of survival provided that they receive support from a breathing machine for two weeks. The instructions will be designed to influence patients to think either intuitively or deliberatively about the questions regarding life-sustaining interventions. Cognitive load: Patients in the intuition arm of the study will be asked to complete a memorization task while they are answering survey questions.</description>

    <time_frame>The trial involves a questionnaire that will be given on a single day; patients will not be followed longitudinally</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in each arm will be asked all of the same questions. The only difference between the arms will be the instructions regarding how and when to answer the series of hypothetical questions regarding acceptance of a tracheostomy and support from a breathing machine for at least two months to survive. The instructions will be designed to influence patients to think either intuitively or deliberatively about the questions regarding life-sustaining interventions. Cognitive load: Patients in the intuition arm of the study will be asked to complete a memorization task while they are answering survey questions.</description>

    <measure>Scores on Uncertainty Subscale of Decisional Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The trial involves a questionnaire that will be given on a single day; patients will not be followed longitudinally</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional uncertainty will be evaluated using the uncertainty subscale of the Decisional Conflict Scale ranging from 0-100 such that 0 = extremely CERTAIN about best choice and 100 = extremely UNCERTAIN about the best choice. Higher values represent MORE UNCERTAINTY with decisions regarding feeding tubes, antibiotics, intubation, and tracheostomy while lower values represent LESS UNCERTAINTY.</description>

        <title>Acceptance or Refusal of a Feeding Tube for Chronic Aspiration</title>
        <description>Patients in each arm will be asked all of the same questions. The only difference between the arms will be the instructions regarding how and when to answer the series of hypothetical questions regarding acceptance of a feeding tube for chronic aspiration. In this hypothetical scenario, patients are presented with a situation in which they are unable to eat or drink safely such that small amounts of food or liquid go to their lungs and cause trouble with breathing. The instructions will be designed to influence patients to think either intuitively or deliberatively about the questions regarding life-sustaining interventions.

          <title>Intuitive</title>
          <description>Patients in each arm will be asked all of the same questions. The only difference between the arms will be the instructions regarding how and when to answer the series of hypothetical questions regarding medical interventions. The instructions will be designed to influence patients to think either intuitively or deliberatively about the questions regarding life-sustaining interventions.
Cognitive load: Patients in the intuition arm of the study will be asked to complete a memorization task while they are answering survey questions.</description>

Deliberative instructions: Patients in the deliberative arm will be given instructions to take their time and deliberate on their decisions</description>
