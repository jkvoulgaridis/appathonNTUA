      A dose escalation study to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMC-3C5
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which
      no standard therapy is available.

      This multicenter study will enroll approximately 40 participants. The actual sample size will
      vary depending on how many participants are needed to obtain at least 3 complete participants
      per cohort.

      IMC-3C5 will initially be administered once every week (Cohorts 1-4) in a dose escalated
      manner. The starting dose will be 5 mg/kg weekly (Cohort 1). Dose escalation will proceed to
      10 mg/kg (Cohort 2), 20 mg/kg (Cohort 3), and 30 mg/kg (Cohort 4). Based on an analysis of
      the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of weekly dosing, participants may be enrolled
      sequentially into 2 every-other-week dose cohorts (Cohorts 5-6, 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg).
      Intermediate doses may also be used.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 46 months</time_frame>
    <description>AEs include serious AEs (SAEs). AEs do not distinguish whether the events are treatment-emergent. A summary of serious and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is presented in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 16 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was defined as any adverse event (National Cancer Institute [NCI]-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], Version 4.0) considered by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to IMC-3C5, that occurred during the DLT Assessment Period (weeks 1 through 6) as follows:
Any Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity
Any Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding fatigue or anorexia lasting &lt;7 days, or Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting that persisted for &lt;2 days following appropriate supportive care intervention)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antitumor Activity of Single Agent IMC-3C5: Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 46 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir. Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.</description>

Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir. Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.</description>
