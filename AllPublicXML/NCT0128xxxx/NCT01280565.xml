  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 7.5 mg/kg/day in the
      treatment of patients with non-resectable or metastatic stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma carrying
      a mutation in the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit and who have not previously been treated for
      melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the juxta
      membrane domain of c-Kit. Masitinib is also thought to promote survival via modulation of
      immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment.
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib with respect
      to dacarbazine in the treatment of non-resectable or metastatic stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma
      carrying a mutation in the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit. Following a protocol amendment,
      the dacarbarzine treatment group was closed and recruitment restricted to masitinib treatment
      of chemo-naïve (first-line) patients.
