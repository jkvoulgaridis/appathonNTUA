  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonclinical studies have shown sandalwood oil to have anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal,
      antiviral, and anti-bacterial activities. Previous clinical studies have shown East Indian
      Sandalwood oil to be promising as a treatment for common warts in adults and children.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10%, 20%, and
      30% East Indian Sandalwood Oil (EISO) ointment compared with the ointment placebo
      administered twice daily (bid) for 12 weeks for the treatment of common warts (Verruca
      vulgaris).
