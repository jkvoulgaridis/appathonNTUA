  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of GWP42003 on liver triglyceride (liver
      fat) in participants with fatty liver disease (FLD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted as a 10-week (eight-week treatment period and one-week safety
      follow-up), randomized, partially-blind study that evaluated the effect of GWP42003 in
      participants with raised liver triglycerides (liver fat ≥5%). Participants were clinically
      diagnosed with FLD and had liver fat levels ≥5% as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging/
      Magnetic Resonance Scanning (MRI/MRS), or were willing to undergo MRI/MRS scan at the
      screening visit to confirm a liver fat content of ≥5%. Eligible participants entered the
      study at a screening visit (Day -10 to -2) and then returned for a fasted baseline visit (Day
      1), a mid-treatment visit (Day 29) and an end of treatment visit (Day 57). Safety follow-up
      telephone calls took place throughout the treatment period up to Day 64 after completion of
      treatment or seven days after date of last dose/withdrawal.

    <masking_description>This study was partially-blinded.
