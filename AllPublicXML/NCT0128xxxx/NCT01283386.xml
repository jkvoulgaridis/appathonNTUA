  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized study compared the efficacy and safety of MabThera (rituximab)
      in combination with either fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or with chlorambucil in
      participants with previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and unfavorable
      somatic status. Participants were randomized to receive Mabthera (375 mg/m2 intravenously
      [IV] Day 1 of Cycle 1, 500 mg/m2 IV Day 1 Cycles 2-6) with either fludarabine (20 mg/m2 IV or
      32 mg/m2 orally Days 1-3) and cyclophosphamide (150 mg/m2 IV or orally Days 1-3) or with
      chlorambucil (10 mg/m2 orally Days 1-7) for 6 cycles of 28 days. Anticipated time on study
      treatment was 24 weeks.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response was defined as the time period from the last day of study treatment to the day when disease progression occurred in participants who previously had complete or partial remission. Disease progression was defined as an increase in lymphocytosis, or enlargement of the lymph nodes or spleen. Complete remission was defined as the disappearance of all signs of disease.

Relapse was defined as disease progression in participants with complete or partial remission lasting at least 6 months after treatment completion. Disease progression was defined as an increase in lymphocytosis, or enlargement of the lymph nodes or spleen. Complete remission was defined as the disappearance of all signs of disease. Partial remission was defined as a reduction in tumor size by &gt;50%.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable medical occurrence in a participant receiving a study drug, regardless of relationship the study drug. An AE was considered serious if it met any of the following criteria: was fatal or life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization; led to persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; was clinically significant and/or required an intervention to prevent any of the listed criteria.</description>

        <title>Event-free Survival</title>
        <description>Event-free survival was defined as the time period from the first day of study treatment to occurrence of any of the following events: appearance of disease progression or relapse; prescription of a new treatment for disease relapse; death caused by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL); or complications from B-CLL or therapy. Relapse was defined as disease progression in participants with complete or partial remission lasting at least 6 months after treatment completion. Disease progression was defined as an increase in lymphocytosis, or enlargement of the lymph nodes or spleen. Complete remission was defined as the disappearance of all signs of disease. Partial remission was defined as a reduction in tumor size by &gt;50%.</description>
