    <textblock>
      EAST prospectively tests the hypothesis that an early, structured rhythm control therapy
      based on antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation can prevent atrial fibrillation (AF)
      related complications in patients with AF when compared to usual care.

      Patients will be randomized to early therapy or usual care. In the early therapy group,
      patients will receive either catheter ablation (usually by pulmonary vein isolation), or
      adequate antiarrhythmic drug therapy at an early time point. The initial therapy will be
      selected by the local investigator. Upon AF recurrence, both modalities will be combined.

      Usual care will be conducted following the 2010European Society of Cardiology ( ESC
      )guidelines for AF treatment. Early rhythm control therapy will be guided by
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.

    <description>The 1st co-primary outcome parameter is defined as the time to the first occurrence of a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke / transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hospitalization due to worsening of heart failure or due to acute coronary syndrome. The second co-primary outcome is nights spent in hospital per year.
The 2nd co-primary outcome is nights spent in hospital per year.</description>

    <time_frame>8 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 2d outcome parameters are defined as
-all-cause death, AF-related death, time to the 1. occurrence of each of the components of the 1st co-primary outcome, time to recurrent AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-lasting persistent, permanent) ,AF burden,time to 1. therapy change, time to 1. cv hosp., nr of cv hosp., left ventricular function at 24 months, QoL changes at 24 months and at study termination comp. to baseline, health-related cost calculation and cost of outpatient treatment, change of cognitive function at 24 months compared to BL, cardiac rhythm (sinus rhythm vs. AF), time to: -first symptomatic AF recurrence, -first progression of AF (from paroxysmal to persistent or long-lasting persistent or permanent and each of these components).
The 1st safety outcome:all deaths, the components of the 1st efficacy parameter plus other AEs rel. to the study intervention with special emphasis on proarrhythmia and complications due to interventions.</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Usual care closely follows the suggestions laid out in the current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for AF treatment. In addition to antithrombotic therapy and therapy of underlying heart disease, usual care usually consists of an initial attempt to control symptoms by rate control therapy. Rhythm control interventions are recommended when symptoms can not be controlled by optimal rate control therapy in the usual care group.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>early standardised rhythm control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the early therapy group will be treated following the same therapeutic recommendations of the ESC guidelines as the usual care group. In addition, rhythm control therapy will be initiated early with the aim of preventing recurrence and delaying or preventing progression of AF.
Early-onset rhythm control therapy can consist of:
Optimal antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Dronedarone, Amiodarone, Flecainide, Propafenone),
Catheter ablation with the aim of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI),
Antiarrhythmic drug therapy and catheter ablation may be supplemented by early cardioversion in patients with persistent AF.
All individual treatment decisions will be taken by the treating study physician considering the labelling of the procedures and drugs and patient preferences.</description>
