      Background:

      - The brain chemical serotonin helps nerve cells communicate. Previous research suggests that
      serotonin activity may be lower in brain areas where seizures start, and that increasing
      activity at the serotonin receptor site on nerve cells may help prevent seizures. Researchers
      are interested in determining whether the experimental medication PRX-00023, which increases
      the activity of serotonin receptors, can reduce seizure frequency in people whose seizures
      are not well-controlled on antiseizure medication. PRX-00023 has not previously been studied
      in people with epilepsy and has not previously been given to people taking antiseizure
      medication at the same time.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of PRX-00023 in reducing the frequency of epileptic seizures
      that start from only one part of the brain.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have frequent epileptic seizures even after
      trying at least two different standard anti-seizure medications (either at the same time or
      one after the other).

      Design:

        -  The study requires 9 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over a 34-week period.
           Individuals who choose to participate in additional studies may be an inpatient during
           some of these visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and
           urine samples, ECG, EEG, neuropsychological studies, imaging studies, including PET and
           MRI scans

        -  Participants will have a 6-week observation and evaluation period before starting the
           study medication. Participants who have at least four seizures during this period will
           be eligible for the treatment portion of the study.

        -  All participants will receive either PRX-00023 or a placebo pill twice daily for 12
           weeks, and will have regular clinic visits with blood samples and imaging studies.

        -  After the 12-week period, participants will have a 2- to 3-week washout period without
           any study medication.

        -  Participants will then have another study medication period, and will receive the
           opposite pill (PRX-00023 or placebo) from the one taken in the first treatment phase.
           Participants will continue to have regular clinic visits with blood samples, ECG, EEG
           and neuropsychologicalstudies.

        -  One month after the end of the second study medication phase, participants will have a
           followup evaluation with a physical examination, blood tests, ECG, EEG, mood and
           neuropsychological tests.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measure for drug efficacy will be:

      Mean difference in seizure frequency comparing the active and placebo periods.

      Secondary outcome measures for efficacy will be:

      Proportion of patients with greater than or equal to 50% lower seizure rate on PRX-00023 than
      placebo

      Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating scales

      Performance on mood and neuropsychological testing scales

      Introduction:

      PRX-00023 is a selective 5HT1A agonist being developed as an oral therapeutic treatment for
      epilepsy.

      Objective:

      To initiate a pilot clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the
      5HT1A receptor agonist PRX-00023 in patients with localization-related epilepsy. PRX-00023 is
      a 5HT1A receptor agonist that has shown promise in clinical trials of depression. Patients
      with localization-related epilepsy have reduced 5HT1A receptor binding on 18FCWAY positron
      emission tomography (PET). Increasing neurotransmitter activity at 5HT1A receptor sites might
      ameliorate seizures. Moreover, depression is a common co-morbidity in people with epilepsy.
      Altered 5HT1A receptor binding has been found in depression.

      Study Population:

      Thirty adults with localization-related epilepsy.

      Design:

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over, phase II clinical trial. Subjects
      will be screened under protocol 01-N-0139 and will undergo medical and epilepsy history and
      physical examination, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory studies including standard
      clinical chemistry and hematology studies, urinalysis, pregnancy test for females of
      childbearing potential, and MRI scan and eo EEG monitoring will be performed if not
      previously completed successfully, and measurement of plasma AED levels (for those AEDs in
      which an assay is available at NIH).

      The trial will have a baseline phase, which will last up to 6 weeks. Baseline may occur
      concurrent with screening procedures. The baseline phase will include measurement of seizure
      frequency (patient will record via seizure calendar). In addition the following will be
      administered, unless previously completed: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale,
      neuropsychological and mood evaluations, FCWAY PET (if not already performed), EEG,
      measurement of plasma AED levels (if assay available), and pregnancy test (for women of child
      bearing potential), saliva samples will be obtained for genetic testing (if not previously
      obtained) and blood samples will be obtained during the PET procedure for cortisol and ACTH
      levels.

      Following baseline, patients will begin the treatment phase (consisting of Period 1 and
      Period 2). Patients will be randomized to PRX-00023 (120mg BID) or matching placebo. After
      completion of the first treatment period, patients will undergo a washout period after which
      patients will be crossed over to the alternate treatment period.

      Outcome measures:

        1. Seizure frequency counts during the 3-month placebo and active treatment phases

        2. Neuropsychological and mood indices

        3. Safety assessment will include adverse events, vital signs, laboratory signs and
           physical examination.

    <measure>Mean Score on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were administered the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) at the end of each three month treatment period, i.e., while participants were either on PRX-0023 or Placebo. The HAM-A measures an individual's severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 parameters, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each group of symptoms is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;/=17 indicates mild anxiety, 18-24 mild to moderate anxiety and 25-30 moderate to severe anxiety and &gt;30 severe anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was administered to participants at the end of each treatment period. The HAM-D is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression. The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of their depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicide ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. Although the HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17 items. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine items are scored from 0-2 with 0 = absent and 2 = frequent or severe. Scores range from 0 to 50 with a score of 0-7 representing normal and a score &gt;/= 23 representing very severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R is a word-list learning and memory test.The participant is read a list of words and asked to recall as many as possible, without regard to the order in which they were read.The list is read three times with recall requested after each presentation (immediate recall) and after a delay (delayed recall). Individual test results are compared to others of the same age (+/-5 years).Test results are presented as T-scores which are conventionally used in neuropsychology. The participant's raw scores are compared to a population expected raw score, for a particular age group. That score is converted to a T-score.The interpretation of these T-scores is such that 50 is representative of the normal score in that age group in the general population. The standard deviation of these distributions are 10 units. Therefore, a score between 30-40 is considered mildly impaired, 20-30 is indicative of severe problems with learning and memory and a score of 60-70 indicates a very good memory.</description>

    <measure>The Mean Score on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), at the End of the Active and Placebo Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The BVMT-R is a test of memory for visual information. Participants are shown a page with several geometric designs arranged in a 2x3 matrix and asked to study the designs. After the page is shown for a brief period the participant is asked to draw each figure.The same page is shown three times with recall requested after each presentation (immediate recall) and after a delay (delayed recall). Individual test results are compared to other people the same age (+/- 5 years).Test results are presented as T-scores which are conventionally used in neuropsychology. The participant's raw scores are compared to a population expected raw score, for a particular age group.That score is converted to a T-score.The interpretation of these T-scores is such that 50 is representative of the normal score in that age group in the general population.The standard deviation of these distributions are 10 units. A score of 30-40 is considered mildly impaired, 20-30 is indicative of severe problems</description>

    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>A Complete Blood Count (CBC) was administered at the end of each three month treatment period. A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including: Red blood cells (which carry oxygen), White blood cells (which fight infection), Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), Hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells to the fluid component (plasma) in your blood), Platelets, (which help with blood clotting). Abnormal increases or decreases in cell counts as revealed in a complete blood count may indicate an underlying medical condition, i.e., anemia (abnormal red blood cells, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit), leucopenia (a decrease in white blood cells), leucocytosis (an increase in white blood cells), and thrombocytosis (an increase in platelets). Results were classified as either normal or abnormal.</description>

        <description>Participants were administered the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) at the end of each three month treatment period, i.e., while participants were either on PRX-0023 or Placebo. The HAM-A measures an individual's severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 parameters, each defined by a series of symptoms. Each group of symptoms is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;/=17 indicates mild anxiety, 18-24 mild to moderate anxiety and 25-30 moderate to severe anxiety and &gt;30 severe anxiety.</description>

        <title>Mean Score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was administered to participants at the end of each treatment period. The HAM-D is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression. The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of their depression by probing mood, feelings of guilt, suicide ideation, insomnia, agitation or retardation, anxiety, weight loss, and somatic symptoms. Although the HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17 items. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine items are scored from 0-2 with 0 = absent and 2 = frequent or severe. Scores range from 0 to 50 with a score of 0-7 representing normal and a score &gt;/= 23 representing very severe depression.</description>

        <title>Mean Score on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods</title>
        <description>The HVLT-R is a word-list learning and memory test.The participant is read a list of words and asked to recall as many as possible, without regard to the order in which they were read.The list is read three times with recall requested after each presentation (immediate recall) and after a delay (delayed recall). Individual test results are compared to others of the same age (+/-5 years).Test results are presented as T-scores which are conventionally used in neuropsychology. The participant's raw scores are compared to a population expected raw score, for a particular age group. That score is converted to a T-score.The interpretation of these T-scores is such that 50 is representative of the normal score in that age group in the general population. The standard deviation of these distributions are 10 units. Therefore, a score between 30-40 is considered mildly impaired, 20-30 is indicative of severe problems with learning and memory and a score of 60-70 indicates a very good memory.</description>

        <description>The BVMT-R is a test of memory for visual information. Participants are shown a page with several geometric designs arranged in a 2x3 matrix and asked to study the designs. After the page is shown for a brief period the participant is asked to draw each figure.The same page is shown three times with recall requested after each presentation (immediate recall) and after a delay (delayed recall). Individual test results are compared to other people the same age (+/- 5 years).Test results are presented as T-scores which are conventionally used in neuropsychology. The participant's raw scores are compared to a population expected raw score, for a particular age group.That score is converted to a T-score.The interpretation of these T-scores is such that 50 is representative of the normal score in that age group in the general population.The standard deviation of these distributions are 10 units.

        <title>Number of Subjects With an Abnormal CBC Result at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods</title>
        <description>A Complete Blood Count (CBC) was administered at the end of each three month treatment period. A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including: Red blood cells (which carry oxygen), White blood cells (which fight infection), Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), Hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells to the fluid component (plasma) in your blood), Platelets, (which help with blood clotting). Abnormal increases or decreases in cell counts as revealed in a complete blood count may indicate an underlying medical condition, i.e., anemia (abnormal red blood cells, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit), leucopenia (a decrease in white blood cells), leucocytosis (an increase in white blood cells), and thrombocytosis (an increase in platelets). Results were classified as either normal or abnormal.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects With an Abnormal CBC Result at the End of the Active and Placebo Periods</title>
          <description>A Complete Blood Count (CBC) was administered at the end of each three month treatment period. A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including: Red blood cells (which carry oxygen), White blood cells (which fight infection), Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), Hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells to the fluid component (plasma) in your blood), Platelets, (which help with blood clotting). Abnormal increases or decreases in cell counts as revealed in a complete blood count may indicate an underlying medical condition, i.e., anemia (abnormal red blood cells, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit), leucopenia (a decrease in white blood cells), leucocytosis (an increase in white blood cells), and thrombocytosis (an increase in platelets). Results were classified as either normal or abnormal.</description>
