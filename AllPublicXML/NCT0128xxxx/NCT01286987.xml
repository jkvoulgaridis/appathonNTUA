  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of talazoparib in patients with advanced tumors
      with DNA-repair pathway deficiencies. There will be 2 parts to the study: a dose escalation
      phase in which the maximum tolerated dose will be defined, and a dose expansion phase.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until disease progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1071 days for Part 1; 834 days for Part 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response in participants was defined as the number of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment with talazoparib and maintained for at least 4 weeks (28 days) as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (where all target lesions were recorded with a length of 0 millimeter [mm] on the case report form [CRF]) and the reduction of the shortest diameter of all nodal lesions to less than [&lt;] 10 mm. PR was defined by a 30% or more decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) + sum of shortest diameters (SSD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD+SSD.</description>

    <description>Best overall response: best response (in the order of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, stable disease [SD] and progressive disease [PD]) among all overall response as RECIST 1.1, recorded from date of first dose of talazoparib until participant withdrew from study/data cut-off date, whichever earlier. CR defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (where all target lesions recorded with a length of 0 mm on the CRF) and the reduction of the shortest diameter of all nodal lesions to &lt; 10 mm. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of target lesions, reference to baseline sum diameters. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference to the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study).</description>

        <description>Objective response in participants was defined as the number of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment with talazoparib and maintained for at least 4 weeks (28 days) as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (where all target lesions were recorded with a length of 0 millimeter [mm] on the case report form [CRF]) and the reduction of the shortest diameter of all nodal lesions to less than [&lt;] 10 mm. PR was defined by a 30% or more decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) + sum of shortest diameters (SSD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD+SSD.</description>

        <title>Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to end of study (up to 1071 days for Part 1 and up to 834 days for Part 2) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
