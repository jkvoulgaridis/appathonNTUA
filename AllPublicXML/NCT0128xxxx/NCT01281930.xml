  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abscesses or &quot;boils&quot; are becoming more common every year and are a common reason children
      come to the Emergency Department. For the abscess to heal the skin needs to be opened to let
      the pus come out. Often doctors put something called &quot;packing material&quot; or gauze into the
      abscess space to help aid in healing. It is not known if the type of &quot;packing&quot; that is done
      is necessary or if a more simple treatment is as good or better. With informed consent we
      randomly place a child into one (1) of two (2) groups in this study that will say if the
      child's abscess/boil is packed with gauze in the traditional way or if a wick (small piece)
      of gauze is placed after the abscess/boil is opened and the fluid is drained. After treatment
      in the emergency department the child will be scheduled to follow-up in the Pediatric Acute
      Wound Service (PAWS) clinic as all other children with this infection are scheduled. At this
      visit the healing of the wound will be checked by the staff in the clinic and will be scored.
      With this evaluation of the wound the hypothesis that for a simple superficial (skin)
      abscess/boil a gauze wick placement into the abscess/boil is as effective as placement of
      traditional gauze packing.
