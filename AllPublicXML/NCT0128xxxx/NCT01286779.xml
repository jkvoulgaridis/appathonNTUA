    <measure>Changes in Health Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) Based on Questionnaire SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at exposure day 1 and at study completion/termination.</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item validated, generic HR QoL instrument suitable for participants of 17 years of age or older. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning) which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. The mental health component summary score ranged from 19.5 to 64.2 with higher scores indicating less disability. The physical health component summary scores ranged from 18.6 to 59.6 with higher scores indicating less disability.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Health Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) Based on Questionnaire Haemo-QoL and Haem-A-QoL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at exposure day 1 and at study completion/termination.</time_frame>
    <description>The Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire (Haemo-QoL) and the Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults (Haem-A-Qol) instruments have been developed and used in hemophilia A patients. As a hemophilia-specific instrument, this measure assesses very specific aspects of dealing with hemophilia. The areas covered by this instrument are: physical health, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and outlook for the future.
Haemo-QoL is used for participants aged 8 to 16 years and total scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating low quality of life (collected scores ranged from 0.0 to 44.3) Haem-A-QoL is used for participants aged 17 years and older and total scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating low quality of life (collected scores ranged from 4.9 to 76.8).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Health Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) Based on Questionnaire EQ-5D and Pain Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at exposure day 1 and at study completion/termination.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D captures overall HR QoL (phyiscal, mental and social functioning). A health utility score can be calculated from this measure, adult and proxy versions available.
EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D VAS):Respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two endpoints (scale range from 0 to 100). Score 0 corresponds to the worst health you can imagine and score 100 corresponds to the best health you can imagine (collected scores ranged from 10-100).
EQ-5D Total Index is based on general population valuation surveys. Responses to 5 questions are converted to an Index value and score range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Total Index was derived on US population (collected scores ranged from 0.4-1).
General pain assessment (Pain score) is done through a visual analog scale (VAS), scores ranging from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more pain (collected scores ranged 0-87).</description>

          <description>PK infusion with investigational product was administered after a wash out period of at least 5 days. Mean residence time is calculated as total area under the moment curve divided by the total area under the curve. MRT=(AUMC0-∞[h2*IU/dL])/(AUC0-∞[h*IU/dL]) - TI/2 where AUMC0-∞ is determined in a similar manner as AUC0-∞ and TI represents infusion duration in hours.</description>

        <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item validated, generic HR QoL instrument suitable for participants of 17 years of age or older. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, mental health, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning) which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability. The mental health component summary score ranged from 19.5 to 64.2 with higher scores indicating less disability. The physical health component summary scores ranged from 18.6 to 59.6 with higher scores indicating less disability.</description>

        <title>Changes in Health Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) Based on Questionnaire Haemo-QoL and Haem-A-QoL</title>
        <description>The Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire (Haemo-QoL) and the Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults (Haem-A-Qol) instruments have been developed and used in hemophilia A patients. As a hemophilia-specific instrument, this measure assesses very specific aspects of dealing with hemophilia. The areas covered by this instrument are: physical health, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and outlook for the future.
Haemo-QoL is used for participants aged 8 to 16 years and total scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating low quality of life (collected scores ranged from 0.0 to 44.3) Haem-A-QoL is used for participants aged 17 years and older and total scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating low quality of life (collected scores ranged from 4.9 to 76.8).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline at exposure day 1 and at study completion/termination.</time_frame>
        <population>Only newly recruited participants are included as baseline values were not reported for transitioning participants. Only subjects how received prophylaxis treatment are included.</population>

        <title>Changes in Health Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) Based on Questionnaire EQ-5D and Pain Score.</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D captures overall HR QoL (phyiscal, mental and social functioning). A health utility score can be calculated from this measure, adult and proxy versions available.
EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D VAS):Respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two endpoints (scale range from 0 to 100). Score 0 corresponds to the worst health you can imagine and score 100 corresponds to the best health you can imagine (collected scores ranged from 10-100).
EQ-5D Total Index is based on general population valuation surveys. Responses to 5 questions are converted to an Index value and score range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Total Index was derived on US population (collected scores ranged from 0.4-1).
General pain assessment (Pain score) is done through a visual analog scale (VAS), scores ranging from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more pain (collected scores ranged 0-87).</description>
