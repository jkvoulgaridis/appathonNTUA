    <textblock>
      Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a non-invasive means of continuously monitoring
      tissue oxygenation, which may be useful for diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome (ACS).
      Placement of these sensor pads on the surface of the skin must be such that light penetrates
      the intended compartment without inadvertently obtaining measurements of an adjacent
      compartment. The objective of this study is to examine whether the NIRS measurements of each
      compartment truly represent the tissue perfusion of the intended compartment, as indicated by
      the predictable decrease in muscle oxygenation of a given compartment in response to muscle
      fatigue. The investigators hypothesize that the tissue oxygenation values of the stimulated
      compartment will significantly decrease following muscle stimulation, indicating that the
      intended muscle compartment was successfully isolated. Additionally, the investigators
      hypothesize that NIRS values of unstimulated muscle compartments will not change from
      baseline.
