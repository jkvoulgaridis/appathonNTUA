      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a two-week course of disulfiram will reduce
      the HIV-1 latent reservoir in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

      This study is using a new approach to try and force HIV out of its protected cellular
      reservoirs.

      Although current therapies are effective at &quot;killing&quot; new viruses that are produced, they are
      unable to access the virus in cells which were infected before antiretroviral therapy began.
      HIV can remain &quot;hidden&quot; in a latent (or resting) form in these cells for many years. Since
      these infected cells can live for many years, they are thought to be the most important
      barrier to HIV eradication (or &quot;cure&quot;).

      Many experts believe that one way to attack latent or &quot;hidden&quot; HIV is to use a drug than can
      &quot;turn on&quot; the virus and hence force HIV-1 out of resting T cells. In a recent study done in
      the laboratory, disulfiram proved to be among the most effective drugs currently available
      that can reactivate latent HIV-1,

      Our primary hypothesis is that disulfiram will reduce the latent reservoir of HIV-1 in
      patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Theoretically, disulfiram will
      force HIV to replicate (grow) and thus result in the death of the infected cell. Standard
      antiretroviral drugs should prevent new cells from becoming infected. The end result of this
      process is that the total amount of HIV in the body will decline over time.

    <measure>Impact of Two Weeks of Disulfiram, as Measured by the Fold Change in the Infectious Units Per Million Cells (IUPM) Between Baseline and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The size of the latent reservoir from each participant was measured by limiting dilution co-culture assay and reported as &quot;infectious units per million cells&quot; (IUPM).This assay measures the frequency of peripheral blood cells from which replication-competent HIV can be grown. The assay was performed at a baseline visit (two weeks before dosing began) and week 12 (10 weeks after the last dose). The primary outcome was the fold-change in IUPM before and after disufiram.</description>

    <measure>The Fold Change in Mean Levels of Viremia During and After Disulfiram Dosing as Compared to Baseline Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 18</time_frame>
    <description>Residual viremia was measured using a singe copy assay (SCA) in plasma samples obtained at enrollment, Days -14, -7, 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18, and at weeks 3, 4, 8 and 12. The level of residual viremia measured by SCA prior to disulfiram (Days 14, 17 and 0), during treatment (Days 1 to 14) and after dosing (Days 16 and 18) was modelled using negative binomial regression, and reported as the mean fold-change during and after disulfiram as compared to that during the baseline period.</description>

        <title>The Fold Change in Mean Levels of Viremia During and After Disulfiram Dosing as Compared to Baseline Levels</title>
        <description>Residual viremia was measured using a singe copy assay (SCA) in plasma samples obtained at enrollment, Days -14, -7, 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18, and at weeks 3, 4, 8 and 12. The level of residual viremia measured by SCA prior to disulfiram (Days 14, 17 and 0), during treatment (Days 1 to 14) and after dosing (Days 16 and 18) was modelled using negative binomial regression, and reported as the mean fold-change during and after disulfiram as compared to that during the baseline period.</description>
