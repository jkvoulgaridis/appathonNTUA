    <time_frame>33 months</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose for a given schedule that was expected to cause DLTs in no more than 33% of patients during the first cycle of treatment. A patient with multiple occurrences of a DLT under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category for that treatment. MTD was determined at 750mg.</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>275 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR = at least two determinations of CR, at least 4 weeks apart before progression. PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2 and life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.

          -  Diagnosed with a locally advanced or metastatic malignancy that has progressed despite
             standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy exists. Only patients
             with tumors characterized by genetic abnormalities in ALK were enrolled.

          -  For NSCLC, an ALK translocation must be detected by FISH in ≥ 15% of tumor cells.

          -  In patients with diseases other than NSCLC, ALK translocation is not required and
             overexpression of ALK protein may be considered indicative of a genetic abnormality in
             ALK.

          -  Patients with measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by modified RECIST
             version 1.0 in dose-escalation phase, and patients with at least one measurable lesion
             as determined by RECIST 1.0 in expansion phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who were
             neurologically unstable or required increasing doses of steroids to control their CNS
             disease were excluded.

          -  Patients with a prior or current history of a second malignancy, impaired GI function,
             history of pancreatitis or increased amylase or lipase, known diagnosis of HIV, and
             clinically significant cardiac disease were excluded.

          -  Patients treated with chemotherapy or biologic therapy or other investigational agent
             &lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug for compounds with a half-life ≤ 3 days, and &lt;
             4 weeks prior to starting study drug for compounds with a prolonged half-life were
             excluded.

          -  Further, patients treated with medications that were known to be strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 that could not be discontinued at least a week prior to start of
             treatment with LDK378 and for the duration of the study were also excluded.

      <recruitment_details>Study was considered completed when all patients discontinued ceritinib treatment, &amp; all required follow-up was completed or patient died, was lost to follow-up or withdrew their consent to further participate in study or last patient on treatment was enrolled to a separate protocol to continue receiving ceritinib treatment, whichever came first.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 304 patients were treated with LDK378 in the study, including 59 patients from the dose-escalation phase (including 10 patients at 750 mg) and 245 patients from the expansion phase treated at LDK378 750 mg.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose for a given schedule that was expected to cause DLTs in no more than 33% of patients during the first cycle of treatment. A patient with multiple occurrences of a DLT under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category for that treatment. MTD was determined at 750mg.</description>

        <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment</title>
        <description>Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR = at least two determinations of CR, at least 4 weeks apart before progression. PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR).</description>

          <description>Cmax is the maximum observed concentration. Blood samples for PK analysis of LDK378 were collected during the study from patients receiving LDK378. However, there was no PK sampling during C1D1 and C2D1 except for 750 mg dose to compute PK parameter Cmax.</description>

        <description>Racc is the accumulation ratio calculated using AUCtau values obtained from a dosing interval at steady-state divided by AUCtau at day 1 or PK run-in phase. AUCtau is the AUC calculated to the end of the dosing interval, tau. Blood samples for PK analysis of LDK378 were collected during the study from patients receiving LDK378. Blood samples for PK analysis of LDK378 were collected during the study from patients receiving LDK378. However, there was no PK sampling during C1D1 and C2D1 except for 750 mg dose to compute PK parameter Racc.</description>

          <title>Secondary Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter: Racc</title>
          <description>Racc is the accumulation ratio calculated using AUCtau values obtained from a dosing interval at steady-state divided by AUCtau at day 1 or PK run-in phase. AUCtau is the AUC calculated to the end of the dosing interval, tau. Blood samples for PK analysis of LDK378 were collected during the study from patients receiving LDK378. Blood samples for PK analysis of LDK378 were collected during the study from patients receiving LDK378. However, there was no PK sampling during C1D1 and C2D1 except for 750 mg dose to compute PK parameter Racc.</description>
          <population>Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS) consisted of all patients (including NSCLC and non-NSCLC) who received at least 1 dose of LDK378 &amp; had at least 1 evaluable PK sample</population>
