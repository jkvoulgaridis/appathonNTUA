  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine is working to improve physicians'
      understanding of brain injury. More information is needed on traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      especially how well a person recovers from TBI and how the brain changes over time in people
      with TBI. To conduct this research, the center is sponsoring a number of research studies on
      TBI and is interested in evaluating individuals with TBI or post-concussive syndrome to
      determine if they might be eligible for future studies.

      Objectives:

      - To develop a pool of individuals with traumatic brain injury and post-concussive syndrome
      for future research studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have symptoms of or have been diagnosed with
      traumatic brain injury or post-concussive syndrome and are willing to participate in future
      studies.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with an initial telephone interview, and will be asked to
           come to the National Institutes of Health for an in-person screening visit.

        -  At the screening visit, participants will provide a medical history, have a physical
           examination and complete a study questionnaire on their TBI and its symptoms, including
           how the injury occurred, when it occurred, and any previous brain-related injuries.

        -  Subjects may also return for a second visit at the NIH CC if eligible.

        -  Each visit may involve blood samples, an MRI scan, and a series of tests to evaluate
           brain function.

        -  Participants will also provide contact information to enable researchers to contact them
           for future studies.

      Objective

      This screening and registry protocol is designed to facilitate subject recruitment for the
      Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) sponsored clinical research studies
      on traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and participating
      CNRM sites. This protocol will serve as a first step for evaluating subjects for possible
      inclusion in CNRM sponsored natural history, observational, or interventional protocols.
      Other approved CNRM protocols may continue to recruit subjects directly into their respective
      studies, and may refer subjects to this study.

      The objective of this protocol is to develop a subject recruitment database that will house
      preliminary data on research subjects who are interested in and potentially eligible for
      current and future CNRM sponsored protocols. The effectiveness of the recruitment methods
      utilized in this protocol will be evaluated to determine the most successful outreach
      approaches and recruitment tools for the enrollment of TBI or post concussive study subjects.

      Study Population

      This protocol will enroll 2500 male and female adult subjects with signs/symptoms or
      diagnosis of TBI or post-concussive syndrome, from participating sites, other CNRM sponsored
      protocols and within the community using various methods of outreach and advertisement.

      Design

      This study involves an initial study visit conducted in one of two ways: at the NIH Clinical
      Center,or at the participating site. Subjects enrolled acutely and/or at a participating site
      may also be provided the option to complete an additional visit at the NIH CC after their
      initial visit. Based on the information obtained during the initial study visit, the subject
      will be referred to appropriate CNRM protocols for further protocol-specific screening prior
      to enrollment, or informed that s/he is not eligible for any other actively enrolling CNRM
      studies at this time. Study procedures may include: physical exam, medical history, nursing
      evaluation, questionnaires completed by interview, blood and urine sample collection, and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Follow-up visits will be conducted by telephone at regular intervals for a year, and then ad
      hoc at potential referral eligibility to update contact information and collect outcome data.
      No treatment is offered under this protocol.

      Outcome Measures

      The outcome measures include accrual of subjects, retention of enrolled subjects and loss to
      follow-up, and referral number and rate of enrolled subjects to other CNRM studies. In
      addition, we will evaluate the frequency and certainty of injury classification (possible,
      probable, or definite TBI).

        Enrollment in this protocol will occur at a participating site MedStar Washington Hospital
        Center (WHC) or Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital (Suburban), or at the NIH Clinical Center
        (NIH CC). Applicable study procedures will depend on the visit site, diagnostic certainty,
        and logistic considerations such as distance from NIH and feasibility of transport. All
        subjects will undergo a study visit at a participating enrollment site and/or the NIH
        Clinical Center. Subjects enrolled acutely at the NIH CC may undergo an additional study
        visit at the NIH. Phone follow-up will occur at 6-months, 1 year from initial consent.
        Additional subject follow-up contact will be made should @@@a subject become eligible for
        referral to another eligible protocol.@@@
