      This pilot clinical trial studies freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) in preventing oral
      cancer recurrence in high at-risk Appalachian patients previously treated with surgery for
      oral cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs natural products to keep cancer from
      developing, progressing, or recurring. Giving freeze-dried black raspberries may prevent oral
      cancer from forming or returning in oral cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct an initial early phase clinical study utilizing a high ar-risk and underserved
      Appalachian population who are former oral cancer patients to determine the practicability of
      long-term daily freeze-dried black raspberry (BRB) (BRB lozenge) administration and to gain
      insights into the potential prevention of recurrent oral cancer by BRBs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate numerous parameters (recruitment, tolerability, adherence to study guidelines,
      collection of biological samples, and demographics) that will be helpful in designing a
      future definitive, randomized, Phase II or III clinical trial structured to assess the
      potential effects of long-term BRB administration.

      II. Evaluate the temporal modulation of BRB-responsive gene expression that favor oral cancer
      chemoprevention in high at-at risk normal tissues before and after BRB administration.

      III. Assess the temporal modulation of BRB-responsive gene expression and biological levels
      of fruit components in post-surgical oral cancer patients not exposed to BRBs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive freeze-dried black raspberry lozenges orally (PO) 4 times daily (QID)
      for up to 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients do not receive freeze-dried black raspberries lozenges.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in Arm I are followed for up to 5 years and
      patients in Arm II are followed for up to 1 year for oral cancer recurrence.

    <description>Former oral cancer patients receive lozenges containing freeze-dried black raspberry (BRB) powder. They will take the lozenges four times each day (QID) by mouth (PO) for up to 6 months.
Patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey documenting any family history of cancer, tobacco, alcohol, and mouthwash use, a Head and Neck Cancer Inventory Survey (HNCI), an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Survey, and a Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Survey.
