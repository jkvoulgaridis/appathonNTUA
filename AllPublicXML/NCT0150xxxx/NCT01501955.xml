      The purpose of this study is to analyze stability, safety and efficacy of the Metaphyseal Hip
      Prosthesis (MHP) compared to the Stanmore hip replacement at short term (1 year) and long
      term (10 years).

      Bone remodeling will be analyzed at 10 years using DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry
      (bone scan test)) measurements.

      This is a single-center prospective study with 25 patients in the study and 25 in the control
      group in open Randomized Clinical Trial.

          -  Patients with a good general condition

          -  Patients willing and able to participate in the clinical trial with a 10 years follow
             up and who have signed an inform consent

          -  Age between 55 and 75

          -  Absence or little presence of osteoporotic bone (t&gt;-2)

          -  ASA score 1 and 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with co morbidities that limit the physical abilities which may negatively
             influence the scores. Such co morbidities can for example be cardiac insufficiency or
             chronic respiratory diseases.

          -  Severe systematic diseases such as rheumatic arthritis and SLE.

          -  General osteoporosis (t&lt;-2).

          -  Hormonal conditions such as Paget disease, which reduces the bone density.

          -  Diseases that can negatively influence the 10 years life expectancy.

          -  Chronic use of corticosteroids.

          -  Extreme overweight defined as BMI above 35.

          -  Active bacterial infection.

          -  Mental weakness which could negatively influence the postoperative recovery and
             influence the ability to complete pain scores and other questionnaires.

          -  ASA score &gt;2.

The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

        <description>HOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

        <description>HOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and hip related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>
