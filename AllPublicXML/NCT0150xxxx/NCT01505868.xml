  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies cabazitaxel with or without carboplatin in
      treating patients with previously treated prostate cancer that has spread to other areas of
      the body and does not respond to treatment with hormones. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cabazitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It
      is not yet known whether giving cabazitaxel alone or with carboplatin is more effective in
      treating prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) of cabazitaxel-carboplatin in the phase I
      portion of the study.

      II. To evaluate progression free survival achieved with cabazitaxel-carboplatin versus
      cabazitaxel alone in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the
      phase II portion of the study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (percentage of patients with &gt; 50
      % decline).

      II. To correlate changes in bone specific alkaline phosphatase and urine n-telopeptides with
      response.

      III. To evaluate overall survival. IV. To evaluate safety and toxicity. V. To evaluate
      influence of the anaplastic phenotype on response to therapy. VI. To collect and archive
      serum, plasma, and urine samples in study patients for later hypothesis generating
      associations.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes and carboplatin
      IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cabazitaxel IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cabazitaxel IV over 60-90 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60-90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

          -  Histologic evidence of prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  In addition to patients with adenocarcinoma, patients with &quot;anaplastic&quot; features are
             also eligible as defined by at least one of the following: a) histologic evidence of
             small cell prostate cancer (patients with small cell carcinoma on histology are not
             required to demonstrate castration-resistant progression); b) any of the following
             metastatic presentations: (i) exclusive visceral metastases; (ii) radiographically
             predominant lytic bone metastases identified by plain X-ray or computed tomography
             (CT) scan; (iii) bulky (&gt;= 5 cm in longest dimension) lymphadenopathy (iv) bulky (&gt;= 5
             cm) tumor mass in the prostate/pelvis (v) low PSA (=&lt; 10 ng/ml) at initial

             castrate-setting) plus high volume (&gt;= 20) bone metastases; (vi) elevated serum
             lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (&gt;= 2 x ULN) or elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen
             (CEA) (&gt;= 2 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) in the absence of other etiologies; (vii)
             short interval (=&lt; 180 days) to castrate-resistant progression following initiation of
             hormonal therapy

          -  Castration-resistant prostate cancer; patients must have surgical or ongoing chemical
             castration (with luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists or LHRH
             antagonists), with a baseline testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/dL

          -  Metastatic disease; patients must have evidence for metastatic prostate cancer by bone
             scan and/or CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (i.e., soft tissue, visceral, lymph
             node); if lymph node, visceral and/or soft-tissue metastases are the only evidence of
             metastasis, at least one lesion must be &gt;= 1.5 cm in diameter

          -  Patients may have received prior treatment with androgen ablative therapies (such as
             bicalutamide, ketoconazole, diethylstilbestrol [DES], abiraterone, Xtandi, ARN-509)
             and/or &quot;targeted&quot; therapies (such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors); androgen ablative
             therapies must be discontinued &gt;= 3 days prior to initiation of study treatment with
             the exception of abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, which may be continued during study
             treatment per the practice preference of the treating physician; patients who are
             predicted to benefit from an antiandrogen withdrawal response should be tested for
             this possibility before being considered for eligibility to this study; targeted
             therapies must be discontinued &gt;= 2 weeks before initiation of study treatment

          -  Both chemotherapy-naive and patients previously treated with chemotherapy are
             eligible; chemotherapy pretreated patients may have received a maximum of two prior

             study treatment

          -  Patients must have documented evidence of progressive disease as defined by any of the
             following: a) PSA progression: minimum of 2 rising values (3 measurements) obtained a
             minimum of 7 days apart with the last result being at least &gt;= 2.0 ng/mL; b) new or
             increasing non-bone disease (by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors

             Group [PCWG2])

          -  For purposes of stratification, patients will be categorized as &quot;responders&quot; or
             &quot;non-responders&quot; based on their response to prior docetaxel-based therapy; a)
             responders will have demonstrated objective responses to first-line docetaxel as
             determined by any of the following: 1. decrease in PSA level &gt;= 50% from baseline,
             maintained for &gt;= 6 weeks; 2. partial or complete response in lymph nodes and soft
             tissue metastases by RECIST; responders must have received &gt;= 225 mg/m^2 (~ 3 cycles)
             of docetaxel; b) patients not meeting response criteria above will be considered as
             non-responders; we anticipate 2 general categories of non-responders based on the
             following disease phenotypes: 1. progressive disease on therapy without any objective
             evidence of response (&quot;primary-resistant disease&quot;); progressive disease on therapy

             &gt;= 50,000/ml are allowed) (within 14 days before registration)

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; upper limit of normal with the exception of isolated
             hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert's syndrome or if the patient has liver metastases

             serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) =&lt;
             1.5 x the ULN or if patient has liver metastases and/or acute tumor-associated
             illness, =&lt; 4 x ULN (within 14 days before registration)
