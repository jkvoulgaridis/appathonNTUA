    <textblock>
      Adequate glycemic control in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a desired therapeutic
      goal that can be achieved with a true non-invasive device offering the likelihood of
      continuous glucose monitoring. Currently, glucose is best monitored by measuring capillary
      blood from the fingertips, from venous/arterial line blood samples and from a daily
      calibrated Subcutaneous Blood Glucose Monitor (SBGM) which is a source of severe
      inconvenience and hence, a lack of compliance.

      Thus, the need for non-invasive and easy to operate glucose monitoring in DM patients for
      strict glycemic control cannot be overemphasized.

      The Glucometer CGM-305 blood glucose readings are accurate and measure blood glucose with an
      acceptable mean relative error when compared to acceptable invasive blood glucose
      measurements.

      The primary objectives of the trial are to determine:

        1. The safety of the Glucometer CGM-305 in evaluating blood glucose levels

        2. The accuracy of the Glucometer CGM-305 in evaluating blood glucose levels

    <description>Safety will be evaluated in a descriptive manner by recording all adverse events in the patient population by number and severity.
The study will evaluate safety by assessing:
Device related adverse events: local and systemic effects of the Glucometer CGM-305 including: redness, burns, pain , or other complications.
General adverse events: Adverse events not directly related to the Glucometer CGM-305 device but are related to the study procedure (i.e clamping), such as: local infection, blood clot, bleeding, hypoglycemia.</description>

    <description>The study procedure consists of three days trial. After each experimental day the results of blood glucose level reading from the non-invasive Glucometer CGM-305 will be compared to the reading from several devices, as following: Abbott Freestyle Libre, the hexokinase assay (YSI 2300 STAT Plus) from the venous and the laboratory blood measurements. First day of trial consists of 8-10 hours and is used to calibrate the non-invasive Glucometer CGM-305 for the specific patient. During the second and third days a fasting experiment is performed and consists of 4-6 hours.</description>
