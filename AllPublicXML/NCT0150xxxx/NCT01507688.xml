  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of a stroke event may result in a disruption to the survivor's daily life.
      Patients with stroke have reported fears of permanent disability and major concerns over
      their ability to recover and be productive and engaged with family, friends and coworkers. To
      enhance recovery from stroke, the investigators designed a stroke self-management program and
      have pilot tested the program among Veterans recovering from stroke/TIA. The study is a
      three-site, randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a stroke
      self-management program. The intervention program includes 6 bi-weekly sessions over months
      1-3 followed by monthly telephone calls as the investigators administered in the
      investigators' pilot study during months 4-6 for a total length of program duration of 6
      months. The investigators have added 3 monthly group support sessions during months 4-6 for
      additional peer support. Thus, participants will receive bi-monthly support during months
      4-6. The three intervention sites include the Jesse Brown VAMC in Chicago, the Roudebush VAMC
      in Indianapolis, and the IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana. The three
      hospitals represent facilities with a small, moderate, and large volume of acute stroke care,
      respectively. Additionally, Methodist Hospital includes a greater proportion of women which
      enables us to study the patterns and preferences of women with stroke/TIA and tailor the
      investigators' future programs to prepare for the increasing female Veteran population.

      Stroke Self-Management: Effect on Function and Stroke Quality of Life Anticipated Impacts on
      Participant's Healthcare: This planned evaluation of the investigators' stroke
      self-management program may improve the patient's healthcare by establishing an
      evidence-based program for which VA case managers may implement to improve patient
      self-management and the health-related quality of life of stroke survivors. This program
      produced standardized manuals for case managers and stroke survivors that may be used in the
      field, in the patient medical care home and via telehealth.

      Project Background: Stroke is prevalent and associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality. Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the US. Within the VA,
      approximately 60,000 patients had a primary outpatient encounter for stroke during fiscal
      year 2010 (FY10). Data from the Office of Quality and Performance (OQP) Stroke Special Study
      demonstrate that more than 5,000 Veterans were admitted to a VA facility for acute ischemic
      stroke in FY07 and another 5000 Veterans with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or
      mini-stroke, were admitted in a VA facility or received care at an urgent clinic or emergency
      department in VA. The total VA cost of stroke treatment was almost $315 million in FY05, with
      a cost per patient of over $18,000. Stroke/TIA survivors are at elevated risk for future
      vascular events and yet, there are no systematic post stroke programs offered widely in VA
      designed to reduce this risk and increase stroke specific quality of life in Veterans. The
      investigators recently developed and pilot tested a stroke self-management program that
      adapted the Stanford Chronic Disease program for stroke.

      Project Objectives: The objectives of this project were to: 1. Conduct a randomized trial
      comparing stroke survivors randomly assigned to receive a stroke self-management program on
      patient functioning, stroke self-management, and stroke specific quality of life compared to
      stroke survivors assigned to usual care; and 2. Conduct a summative evaluation among VA
      clinical providers, patients with stroke and their caregivers to understand the barriers and
      facilitators of implementing the stroke self-management program.

      Project Methods: To accomplish these aims, the investigators employed mixed methods. For the
      first aim, the investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing subjects
      randomly assigned to the stroke self-management intervention to subjects randomly assigned to
      usual care. Subjects from both groups were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. We
      delivered the stroke self-management program over 6 months (12 weeks biweekly sessions
      followed by 12 weeks of bimonthly telephone and group support sessions). Usual care
      participants received written stroke risk factor materials. The primary outcomes were stroke
      specific quality of life and the secondary outcomes were stroke self-management,
      self-efficacy, functioning, and post stroke depression. We are evaluating clinical risk
      factor management after stroke.

    <description>A 49-item instrument that assesses 12 domains relevant to stroke patients' health-related quality of life including: energy, mobility, work, upper extremity function, activities of daily living, family roles, social roles, vision, language, thinking, mood, and personality. A lower score indicates poorer functioning and a higher score indicates better functioning. The minimum value was 1 and maximum value was 5. A Total Stroke Specific Quality of Life Score was calculated as the mean of the 49-items.</description>

          <description>NIHSS is a clinical assessment of stroke severity and disability at time of stroke. This scale captures total stroke deficits in several domains (consciousness, vision, extraocular movement, facial control, limb strength, ataxia, sensation, and speech and language. Each item is scored and total score is sum of all items. Score ranges from [0 to 42] where 0 reflects no stroke disability and scores between 21-42 indicate severe stroke disability. Scores between 1-4 = minor stroke; Scores between 5-15= moderate stroke; and Scores between 15-20= moderate/severe stroke disability.</description>

          <description>Stroke Specific, Health-Related Quality of Life. Self-reported measure includes 12 domains over 49 items and an Overall Total Score. Items are scored on a 5 point Likert response format with lower score indicating worse function/lower ability on that item and a higher score indicating better function. Domain score were calculated as an unweighted average of item scores in that specific domain. Overall Stroke Specific, Health-Related Quality of Life = average items 50-62 where a lower score indicates worse health now compared to before the stroke event.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events were monitored and reported during each assessment period [ 3, 6, and 12 months] after baseline. Participants were asked whether they experienced an adverse or serious adverse event since last contact. If a participant was not available, the interviewer contacted the next of kin listed on the participant contact information provided and asked about adverse events.</time_frame>
      <desc>All Adverse (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and deaths were reported to the Indiana University IRB per protocol. All were reviewed by the IRB and deemed unrelated to our research study.
SAE were defined as a health event for which the participant was hospitalized for medical care.
AE were defined as a health event experienced and treated by medical personnel but not hospitalized.
Deaths were reported as any death occurring during the participant enrollment in the study.</desc>
