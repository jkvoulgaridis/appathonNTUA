  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to investigate the efficacy profile of the SENSIMED
      Triggerfish® during 24-hour IOP monitoring in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension,
      done three times at monthly intervals under different therapeutic regimen. This trial will
      also evaluate the efficacy of SENSIMED Triggerfish® to detect changes in intraocular pressure
      (IOP) after the water drinking test (WDT) will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation will recruit male and female patients 18-80 years old and diagnosed with
      glaucoma or ocular hypertension requiring hypotensive ocular treatment. Up to 100 subjects
      will be enrolled in the study to ensure a minimum of 80 completing three IOP fluctuation
      monitoring sessions. Patients will be considered enrolled in the study upon signature of
      informed consent. A screening visit and three 26-hour IOP fluctuation monitoring sessions are
      planned for each patient. IOP monitoring sessions will be carried out in ambulatory mode at 4
      week intervals (plus/minus 7 days). All subjects will be monitored during the same period of
      the day (± 1hr). The expected duration of participation for each patient is of 3.5 days over
      three to four months. Patients will be recruited over a 16-month period. The total expected
      study duration is 16 months.
