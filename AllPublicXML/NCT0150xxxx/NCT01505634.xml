  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of adding 125
      mg or 250 mg doses of MK-7655 (relebactam) to imipenem/cilastatin in adults 18 years or older
      with complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). The primary hypothesis is that the
      relebactam + imipenem/cilastatin treatment regimen is non-inferior to imipenem/cilastatin
      with respect to the proportion of participants with a favorable microbiological response at
      completion of intravenous (IV) study therapy.

    <description>Microbiological response (MR) was assessed based on results of bacterial cultures obtained at completion of IV study medication relative to cultures obtained at baseline. A favorable microbiological response was defined as eradication of all pathogens identified at baseline. Microbiological response was assessed separately for each participant and pathogen identified in the Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) population that included participants with a urine culture confirmed to be positive for at least 1 gram-negative and/or anaerobic pathogen(s) commonly isolated in UTI. The overall microbiological response was determined as &quot;favorable&quot; if all pathogens isolated from a participant at baseline demonstrated a &quot;favorable&quot; response (eradication) at the time point evaluated.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Favorable Microbiological Response at Completion of IV Study Therapy</title>
        <description>Microbiological response (MR) was assessed based on results of bacterial cultures obtained at completion of IV study medication relative to cultures obtained at baseline. A favorable microbiological response was defined as eradication of all pathogens identified at baseline. Microbiological response was assessed separately for each participant and pathogen identified in the Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) population that included participants with a urine culture confirmed to be positive for at least 1 gram-negative and/or anaerobic pathogen(s) commonly isolated in UTI. The overall microbiological response was determined as &quot;favorable&quot; if all pathogens isolated from a participant at baseline demonstrated a &quot;favorable&quot; response (eradication) at the time point evaluated.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Any Drug-related AE</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. A drug-related (DR) AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product that the investigator determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued IV Study Therapy Due to an AE</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE.</description>

        <description>Microbiological response was assessed based on results of bacterial cultures obtained at completion of IV study medication relative to cultures obtained at baseline. A favorable microbiological response was defined as eradication of all pathogens identified at baseline. Microbiological response was assessed separately for each participant and pathogen identified in the Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) population that included participants with a urine culture confirmed to be positive for imipenem-resistant gram-negative or anaerobic infections at baseline. The overall microbiological response was determined as &quot;favorable&quot; if all pathogens isolated from a participant at baseline demonstrated a &quot;favorable&quot; response (eradication) at the time point evaluated.</description>
