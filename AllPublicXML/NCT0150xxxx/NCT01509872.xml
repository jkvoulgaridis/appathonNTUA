  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in knowing whether a group-based, trauma-focused
      intervention (Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is superior to a more general, non
      trauma-focused, psychosocial intervention (Child Friendly Spaces) in reducing post-traumatic
      stress, depression and anxiety and conduct problems and increasing pro-social behavior among
      war-affected children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    <measure>Change in Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms as Measured by the University of California Los Angelus Post Traumatic Stress Disorder -Reaction Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 week post-intervention and 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA PTSD Reaction Index is a self-report questionnaire that measures exposure to traumatic events and assesses post-tramatic stress symptoms in school-age children and adolescents. The Congolese Swahili version used in the study had 22 items and assesses the frequency of occurrence of PTSD symptoms during the past week (rated from 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time). The scale ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 88 (highest score possible). Although no cut-off score was used, the higher the score of the scale the higher the number of PTSD symptoms experienced.</description>

    <measure>Change in Internalizing Symptoms as Measured by the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 week post-intervention and 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument is a self-report questionnaire that measures internalizing, externalizing, conduct and pro-social (daily life functioning) skills symptoms. The Congolese Swahili version of the AYPA contained 19 questions on internalizing symptoms and assesses the frequency of occurrence of internalizing symptoms during the past week (rated from 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time). The lowest score obtainable on the measure was 0, while the highest score obtainable was 76. Although no cut-off score was used, the higher the score on the scale, the greater the psychosocial distress being reported.</description>

    <description>The African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument is a self-report questionnaire that measures internalizing, externalizing, conduct and pro-social (daily life functioning) skills symptoms. The Congolese Swahili version of the AYPA contained 10 questions about symptoms of conduct disorder and assesses the frequency of occurrence of externalizing symptoms during the past week (rated from 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time). The lowest score obtainable on the measure was 0, while the highest score obtainable was 40. Although no cut-off score was used, the higher the score on the scale, the greater the psychosocial adjustment difficulties being reported.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pro-Social Behaviors as Measured by the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3-week post-intervention, 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument is a self-report questionnaire that measures internalizing, externalizing, conduct and pro-social (daily life functioning) skills symptoms. The Congolese Swahili version of the AYPA contained 8 questions about pro-social behavior and assesses the frequency of occurrence of positive behaviors (e.g. sharing with others, listening to others and elders etc.) during the past week (rated from 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time). The lowest score obtainable on the measure was 0, while the highest score obtainable was 32. Although no cut-off score was used, the higher the score on the scale, the more pro-social the individual's behavior is.</description>

    <description>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (Cohen, Mannarino, Deblinger, 2006; Smith and Saunders, 2005) is a child-friendly, manualised psychological intervention for children who experience nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, anger, social isolation, poor concentration or self-blame after experiencing or witnessing a violent and terrifying life event (e.g. rape, murder, abduction etc).

        <title>Change in Internalizing Symptoms as Measured by the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument</title>
        <description>The African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument is a self-report questionnaire that measures internalizing, externalizing, conduct and pro-social (daily life functioning) skills symptoms. The Congolese Swahili version of the AYPA contained 19 questions on internalizing symptoms and assesses the frequency of occurrence of internalizing symptoms during the past week (rated from 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time). The lowest score obtainable on the measure was 0, while the highest score obtainable was 76. Although no cut-off score was used, the higher the score on the scale, the greater the psychosocial distress being reported.</description>

The Congolese Swahili version of the AYPA contained 8 questions about pro-social behavior and assesses the frequency of occurrence of positive behaviors (e.g. sharing with others, listening to others and elders etc.) during the past week (rated from 0 = none of the time to 4 = most of the time). The lowest score obtainable on the measure was 0, while the highest score obtainable was 32. Although no cut-off score was used, the higher the score on the scale, the more pro-social the individual's behavior is.</description>

          <description>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (Cohen, Mannarino, Deblinger, 2006; Smith and Saunders, 2005) is a child-friendly, manualised psychological intervention for children who experience nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety, anger, social isolation, poor concentration or self-blame after experiencing or witnessing a violent and terrifying life event (e.g. rape, murder, abduction etc). This intervention was culturally modified for use with war-affected children.
