    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks for each stage</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D17 scale is a clinician-administered questionnaire comprised of 17 items used to measure the severity of MDD symptoms. Scores range from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 50 (most severe symptoms). Individual questionnaire items include depressed mood, work and activities, insomnia (early), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), genital symptoms, somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal), loss of weight, somatic symptoms (general), feelings of guilt, suicide, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), hypochondriasis, insight, agitation, and retardation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients Who Exhibited Treatment Response (HAM-D17)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks for each stage</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects demonstrating HAM-D17 treatment response, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in HAM-D17 score from baseline to the end of the efficacy period (Week 4). The HAM-D17 is a clinician administered questionnaire comprised of 17 questions used to assess the severity of a patient's depression. Scores range from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 50 (most severe symptoms). Individual questionnaire items include depressed mood, work and activities, insomnia (early), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), genital symptoms, somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal), loss of weight, somatic symptoms (general), feelings of guilt, suicide, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), hypochondriasis, insight, agitation, and retardation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks for each stage</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS-10 scale is a clinician-administered questionnaire comprised of 10 items used to measure the severity of MDD symptoms. Scores range from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 60 (most severe symptoms). Individual questionnaire items include: Apparent Sadness, Reported Sadness, Inner Tension, Reduced Sleep, Reduced Appetite, Concentration Difficulties, Lassitude, Inability to Feel, Pessimistic Thoughts, and Suicidal Thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks for each stage</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how mentally ill the patient is at a specific point in time. Based on the scale, patients are categorized as follows: &quot;1: normal, not at all ill&quot;; &quot;2: borderline mentally ill&quot;; &quot;3: mildly ill&quot;; &quot;4: moderately ill&quot;; &quot;5: markedly ill&quot;; &quot;6: severely ill&quot;; and &quot;7: among the most extremely ill patients.&quot;</description>

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and had an inadequate response to 1 or 2 adequate courses of treatment with a commercially available antidepressant therapy (ADT) during the current major depressive episode (MDE). All subjects continued ADT for the duration of the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This was a Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD) study comprised of 2 stages. In Stage 1 subjects were randomized to ALKS 5461 or placebo (2:2:9). In Stage 2 only placebo non-responders from Stage 1 were re-randomized to ALKS 5461 or placebo (1:1:1). One subject randomized to placebo did not receive study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) Total Score</title>
        <description>The HAM-D17 scale is a clinician-administered questionnaire comprised of 17 items used to measure the severity of MDD symptoms. Scores range from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 50 (most severe symptoms). Individual questionnaire items include depressed mood, work and activities, insomnia (early), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), genital symptoms, somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal), loss of weight, somatic symptoms (general), feelings of guilt, suicide, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), hypochondriasis, insight, agitation, and retardation.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks for each stage</time_frame>
        <population>Stage 1 and Stage 2 Full Analysis Sets (FAS) consisted of subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline HAM-D17 assessment in the respective stage. Two subjects randomized to 8/8 in Stage 1 received 2/2. These subjects are included in the 8/8 group for efficacy analysis.</population>

          <description>The HAM-D17 scale is a clinician-administered questionnaire comprised of 17 items used to measure the severity of MDD symptoms. Scores range from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 50 (most severe symptoms). Individual questionnaire items include depressed mood, work and activities, insomnia (early), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), genital symptoms, somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal), loss of weight, somatic symptoms (general), feelings of guilt, suicide, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), hypochondriasis, insight, agitation, and retardation.</description>
          <population>Stage 1 and Stage 2 Full Analysis Sets (FAS) consisted of subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline HAM-D17 assessment in the respective stage. Two subjects randomized to 8/8 in Stage 1 received 2/2. These subjects are included in the 8/8 group for efficacy analysis.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Total Score</title>
          <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how mentally ill the patient is at a specific point in time. Based on the scale, patients are categorized as follows: &quot;1: normal, not at all ill&quot;; &quot;2: borderline mentally ill&quot;; &quot;3: mildly ill&quot;; &quot;4: moderately ill&quot;; &quot;5: markedly ill&quot;; &quot;6: severely ill&quot;; and &quot;7: among the most extremely ill patients.&quot;</description>
          <population>Stage 1 and Stage 2 Full Analysis Sets (FAS) consisted of subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline HAM-D17 assessment in the respective stage. Two subjects randomized to 8/8 in Stage 1 received 2/2. These subjects are included in the 8/8 group for efficacy analysis.</population>
