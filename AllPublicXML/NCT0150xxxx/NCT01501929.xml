  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Nebivolol improves microvascular perfusion in
      skeletal muscle during exercise in hypertensive patients and whether this improvement is
      accompanied by reduction in vascular oxidative stress or increased endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase (eNOS) expression in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 32 untreated stage 1 hypertensive subjects, the investigators will measure blood pressure;
      noninvasive cardiac output by thoracic electrical bioimpedance (Bioz, Cardio Dynamics);
      forearm mediated vasodilation (FMD), which is a non-invasive assessment of endothelial
      function; collect venous endothelial cells; and measure microvascular perfusion using an
      Octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agent (Definity).

      To obtain FMD, the brachial artery will be imaged using ultrasound. After a clear picture has
      been obtained, the cuff on the same arm will be inflated until it is tight for five minutes.
      During and following this, the subject's arm will continue to be imaged to monitor maximal
      increase in the brachial artery diameter.

      To collect endothelial cells, a thin wire will be inserted in the vein to collect cells from
      the inner lining of the vein. The cells collected will be processed and stained for several
      proteins involved in endothelial cell function, using immunofluorescent technique.

      To assess the microvascular perfusion in the skeletal muscle, a contrast agent (Definity)
      will be administered at baseline and after 5 minutes of rhythmic hand grip exercise at 30% of
      maximal voluntary contraction.

      The investigators will then randomize our subjects to receive 12 weeks of Metoprolol or
      Nebivolol, using a cross over design. There will be a 4 week washout period between the two
      treatments. During the washout period, subjects will be followed after 2 weeks of drug
      withdrawal. Subjects found to have BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg then, will be started on
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) at 25 mg once daily. Then subjects will be asked to return in 2
      weeks. At that time HCTZ will be stopped if started in the earlier visit, and subject will be
      switched to the remaining treatment (Nebivolol or Metoprolol). Then, the investigators will
      assess microvascular perfusion in the skeletal muscle at rest and during handgrip exercise,
      endothelial function (FMD), and changes in endothelial cell protein expression after 12 weeks
      of Nebivolol and after 12 weeks of Metoprolol treatment in the same subjects.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial cell (EC) was collected after a 20-guage angiocatheter was inserted into the contralateral forearm vein under sterile conditions. Three J-shaped vascular guidewires (St. Jude, St. Paul, MN) were advanced sequentially into the vein up to 10 cm. Endothelial cells were collected by gentle abrasion and placed into a dissociation buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2mM EDTA, and 100 ug/ml heparin in PBS). Endothelial cells were recovered from the tips of guide wires by repeated washing into collection tubes and subsequent centrifugation. EC were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the polyclonal antibodies against NADPH oxidase p47 subunit. The intensity of staining was measured using fluorescence microscopy.</description>

    <description>Using high-resolution ultrasound, we will measure skeletal muscle blood flow during infusion of a solution containing the octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agent, Definity. The solution will be a dilution of 1 vial of Definity to 30 cc of normal saline.

          <description>After the baseline measurement, all subjects were randomized to receive either nebivolol at the dose of 5 mg once daily or Metoprolol succinate 100 mg once daily, using a double-blind crossover design. If BP remained above 140/90 mmHg during the first follow-up visit, the dose of Nebivolol was increased up to 20 mg once daily and Metoprolol was increased up to 300 mg once daily.</description>

        <title>Endothelial Cell Protein Expression p47phox From Endothelial Cell Collection</title>
        <description>Endothelial cell (EC) was collected after a 20-guage angiocatheter was inserted into the contralateral forearm vein under sterile conditions. Three J-shaped vascular guidewires (St. Jude, St. Paul, MN) were advanced sequentially into the vein up to 10 cm. Endothelial cells were collected by gentle abrasion and placed into a dissociation buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2mM EDTA, and 100 ug/ml heparin in PBS). Endothelial cells were recovered from the tips of guide wires by repeated washing into collection tubes and subsequent centrifugation. EC were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the polyclonal antibodies against NADPH oxidase p47 subunit. The intensity of staining was measured using fluorescence microscopy.</description>
