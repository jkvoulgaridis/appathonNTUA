    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory changes occurring in any phase of a clinical trial, and whether or not considered study drug-related. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as all AEs occurring on or after the first IDDD surgery date or first dose (whichever is earlier) for the participant (whether it is in this extension study or in HGT HIT-045 [NCT00920647]) and before the end of the study (EOS) visit (+30 days).</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have completed all study requirements and end of study assessments
             for study HGT-HIT-045 prior to enrolling in Study HGT-HIT-046 and must have no safety
             or medical issues that contraindicate participation.

          -  The participant's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) must have voluntarily
             signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee(IEC)-approved
             informed consent form after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained and
             discussed. Consent of the participant's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s)
             and the participant's assent, as relevant, must be obtained.

          -  The participant has received and tolerated a minimum of 12 months of treatment with
             weekly IV infusions of Elaprase and has received 80% of the total planned infusions
             within the last 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical
             investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or device) other than the
             PORT-A-CATH IDDD within 30 days prior to study enrollment or at any time during the
             study.

          -  The participant is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, is unable to return for
             safety evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study) as determined by
             the investigator.

          -  The participant has experienced an adverse reaction to study drug in Study HGT-HIT-045
             that contraindicates further treatment with intrathecal idursulfase-IT.

          -  The participant has a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of
             idursulfase-IT.

          -  The participant has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is
             thought to be at an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to airway compromise or
             other conditions.

          -  The participant has a condition that is contraindicated as described in the
             SOPH-A-PORT Mini S IDDD Instructions for Use, including:

               1. The participant has had, or may have, an allergic reaction to the materials of
                  construction of the SOPH-A-PORT Mini S device

               2. The participant's body size is too small to support the size of the SOPH-A-PORT
                  Mini S Access Port, as judged by the investigator

               3. The participant's drug therapy requires substances known to be incompatible with
                  the materials of construction

               4. The participant has a known or suspected local or general infection

               5. The participant is at risk of abnormal bleeding due to a medical condition or
                  therapy

               6. The participant has one or more spinal abnormalities that could complicate safe
                  implantation or fixation

               7. The participant has a functioning CSF shunt device

               8. The participant has shown an intolerance to an implanted device

          -  The participant has an opening CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture that exceeds 30.0
             centimeter (cm) water (H2O).
