  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal newvessels may arise from a fan of pathologies, inducing long-standing corneal
      opacification requiring keratoplasty. These last years, VEGF inhibitors have been designed to
      reduce newascularization induced by gastric cancer or age-related macular degeneration. A few
      reports have been published showing the interest of VEGF inhibitors to treat corneal
      newvessels, but no randomized study has been achieved to date.

      This study is designed to assess the efficacy of Bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor monoclonal
      antibody, to reduce the surface of corneal newvessels in when compared to placebo

      This study will involve 42 outpatients of the CHU of Limoges, Bordeaux, and Toulouse,
      addressed for corneal pathologies including corneal newvessels. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups, one receiving three subconjunctival injections of bevacizumab, the
      other three subconjunctival injections of placebo (Balanced salt solution). The progression
      of newvessels will be assessed using color photographs and a picture-analyser software that
      will calculate the percentage of corneal surface occupied by the newvessels. Randomization,
      and preparation of both study drug and placebo syringes will be performed by the central
      pharmacy of the CHU de Limoges. Patients will be followed-up as outpatients, with visits
      scheduled 15 days before treatment, at baseline, and then at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and
      6 months.

        -  Primary outcome: To demonstrate Bevacizumab subconjunctival injections effectiveness on
           corneal neovascularisation reduction definite by a superior percentage of patient with a
           reduction higher than 30 % of the corneal surface occupied by newvessels , at 3 months,
           in the group Bevacizumab compared with the group placebo

        -  Secondary outcomes:

        -  The effectiveness of bevacizumab on reducing the percentage of corneal surface occupied
           by neovascularization at 6 months

        -  The effectiveness of bevacizumab on reducing the use of corneal graft.

        -  The local and general toxicity of bevacizumab administered by subconjunctival way.
