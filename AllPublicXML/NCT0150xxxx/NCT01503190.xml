      This study plans to learn more about the immune system's response to breast cancer in young
      women.

      The investigators will be looking at the level of immune suppression in different types of
      breast cancer. The investigators will use blood, urine, and tissue samples from patients with
      Pregnancy Associated Breast Cancer (PABC) versus non-PABC, as well as comparing different
      types of breast cancer. If tissue sampling permits, the investigators may use some of the
      breast cancer tissue to develop models for human cancer for drug targeting. Understanding the
      immune response and suppression in different types of cancer will help us understand
      mechanisms involved in breast cancer better and help the investigators in developing new
      treatment in the future.

        Women over the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Women over age 46 will

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females &gt;18.

          2. Histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer.

          3. For patients diagnosed with needle core or excisional biopsy, formalin-fixed paraffin
             embedded tumor blocks or unstained slides should be available or planned to be
             available after upcoming procedure.

          4. Patient should be willing to have fresh and/or fresh frozen tissue collected at time
             of core biopsy, definitive breast cancer surgery or clinically planned breast cancer
             metastasis biopsy/resection for research purposes as part of study procedures, if a
             procedure is in the future planning of the patient's treatment.

          5. Any clinical stage allowed.

          6. Written informed consent obtained prior to any initiation of study procedures in the
             case of subjects consented in clinic. Subjects consented outside of UCH, VVMC or SCC
             will be consented by phone and verbal informed consent will be obtained prior to any
             initiation of study procedures.

          7. Women treated at UCH, VVMC or SCC may be pregnant. Other participants are excluded for
             safety reasons.

          8. Women who have commenced or completed their breast cancer treatment may join this
             study by consenting to a retrospective tissue donation only consent of the protocol.

          9. Women who receive their care at a facility other than UCH, VVMC or SCC may join this
             study. These women will be consented utilizing the phone consent and will receive a
             copy of the consent in the mail, or they will consent online and print a copy of their
             online consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known significant autoimmune condition [ie Lupus, Crohne's disease or Rhuematoid
             Arthritis], chronic oral steroid use, use of systemic immunomodulatory prescription
             drugs for any medical condition.

          2. The presence of other comorbid conditions known to significantly impact immune
             function, (such as: type I diabetes, uncontrolled adult onset diabetes, severe COPD,
             uncontrolled infection or known HIV infection.)

          3. Underlying psychiatric condition which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude compliance with study requirements

          4. Subjects with a history of other malignancy besides current diagnosis of breast cancer
             who were diagnosed and treated within the last 5 years are excluded, with exception of
             cervical cancer definitively treated more than 2 years ago or non-melanomatous skin
             cancer.
