  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of different dosing regimens of
      ImmunoPulse IL-12® in malignant melanoma. ImmunoPulse IL-12® is the combination of
      intratumoral interleukin-12 gene (also known as tavokinogene telseplasmid [tavo]) and in vivo
      electroporation-mediated plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] vaccine therapy (tavo-EP)
      administered using the OncoSec Medical System (OMS). ImmunoPulse IL-12® is a gene therapy
      approach to directly induce a pro-inflammatory response within a tumor to initiate and/or
      enhance anti-tumor immunity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmid IL-12 (pIL-12) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL will be injected intratumorally at a
      dose volume of ¼ of the calculated lesion volume and a dose volume per lesion of 0.1 mL for
      lesions of volume &lt; 0.4 cm3. Six pulses at field strengths of (E+) of 1500 V/cm and pulse
      width of 100 μs at 1-second intervals will be administered using the OncoSec Medical System
      (OMS) to each previously injected tumor.

      Three treatment regimens will be explored:

      Main Study: Treatment on Days 1, 5 and 8 for 1 cycle. Additional cycles may be repeated every
      3 months at the Investigator's discretion.

      Addendum Regimen A: Treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 6 weeks. Subsequent cycles may be
      given at 6-week intervals, for up to 9 treatment cycles in total.

      Addendum Regimen B: Treatment on Days 1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks. Subsequent cycles may be
      given at 6-week intervals, for up to 9 treatment cycles in total.

      NOTE: An Addendum was added to the Main Protocol with the purpose of exploring the safety and
      efficacy of an increased treatment frequency schedule.

    <measure>Best Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Modified &quot;Skin&quot; RECIST</measure>
    <time_frame>Main Study: Screening and Days 90, 180, 270 and 360; Addendum: Screening and Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with evaluable lesions that achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using Modified &quot;Skin&quot; Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR: complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not) and the absence of new lesions for at least 4 weeks duration, confirmed by additional scan and visit 4 to 6 weeks after first documentation of CR. PR: ≥30% decrease in longest dimension (LD) from baseline lesion, and no new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first administration of study treatment up to 30 days after last dose or until initiation of new anti-cancer treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which did not necessarily have to have had a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could have, therefore, been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined an any untoward medical occurrence that at any dosage resulted in one or more of the following: death, A life-threatening adverse event (real risk of dying), inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage.</description>

    <description>Duration of objective response (CR or PR based on Modified RECIST criteria) is defined as the number of days from the initial documentation of an objective response to the most current evaluation of that response or to documentation of progression or death associated with disease progression. CR: complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not) and the absence of new lesions for at least 4 weeks duration, confirmed by additional scan and visit 4 to 6 weeks after first documentation of CR. PR: ≥30% decrease in longest dimension (LD) from baseline lesion, and no new lesions. Patients who had an initial response and did not progress were censored at their date of last assessment.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment until overall objective response (Up to 29.7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to objective response (CR or PR based on Modified RECIST criteria) is defined as the number of days between the date of treatment initiation (Study Day 1) to the first date of the first documentation of an objective response. CR: complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not) and the absence of new lesions for at least 4 weeks duration, confirmed by additional scan and visit 4 to 6 weeks after first documentation of CR. PR: ≥30% decrease in longest dimension (LD) from baseline lesion, and no new lesions. Patients who had an initial response and did not progress were censored at their date of last assessment. Patients who did not have an objective response were censored at their date of last assessment.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment until disease progression or death (Up to 29.7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration between the date of treatment initiation (Study Day 1) to the first date of either disease progression at either local or distant sites, or death from any cause. Disease progression at local or distant lesions is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Patients were censored at their last assessment date if there was no evidence of disease progression.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which did not necessarily have to have had a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could have, therefore, been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined an any untoward medical occurrence that at any dosage resulted in one or more of the following: death, A life-threatening adverse event (real risk of dying), inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage.</description>

        <title>Median Progression Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration between the date of treatment initiation (Study Day 1) to the first date of either disease progression at either local or distant sites, or death from any cause. Disease progression at local or distant lesions is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Patients were censored at their last assessment date if there was no evidence of disease progression.</description>
