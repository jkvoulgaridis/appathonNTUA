      fraction, or HFPEF.

      Denise Barnard, M.D., and her associates, are conducting a research study to find out more
      about ways to improve symptoms in patients with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection
      Fraction (HFPEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a condition where the
      heart squeezes well but is stiff. This stiffness in the heart muscle makes the heart unable
      to fill, leading to shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Subjects with HFPEF
      are asked to participate in this study. There will be approximately 40 participants enrolled
      in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Ranolazine (Ranexa)
      in patients with HFPEF. The study is sponsored by the manufacturers of the drug, Gilead
      Pharmaceuticals.

      Ranolazine is a drug that affects the ion channels in the heart. In patients with heart
      failure, these ion channels do not work properly, and contribute to make the heart stiff. A
      stiff heart leads to the symptoms of shortness of breath which patients with HFPEF
      experience. Due to its properties, Ranolazine may improve this stiffness. Ranolazine could
      improve subject's shortness of breath and ability to exercise.

      Currently, ranolazine carries FDA approval for the treatment of chronic angina only. We
      intend to study ranolazine in patients with HFPEF, in the absence of documented ischemia, to
      determine whether the drug's lusitropic properties can improve exercise capacity in HFPEF
      patients.

      Previous trials of ranolazine in patients with chronic angina found that there was a
      dose-dependent relationship between improvements in exercise capacity and ranolazine.
      However, there did appear to be a plateau in which 1500 mg of ranolazine twice daily improved
      exercise capacity only slightly more than 1000 mg of ranolazine given twice daily.
      Additionally, there was a substantially higher rate of adverse events (mainly nausea,
      dizziness, and asthenia) with the higher dose. Given the desire to maximize benefit and
      minimize the risk of adverse events, ranolazine 1000 mg by mouth twice daily was chosen as
      the target dose.

      To properly evaluate the effects of Ranolazine, this research study is set up as a double
      blind, placebo controlled study. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like rolling a dice) to
      either Ranolazine or placebo (inactive substance). Subjects will have a 50% chance of getting
      the study drug and 50% chance of getting placebo.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QOL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (HF) Questionnaire was re-administered at the 6 week time point. The total quality of life (QOL) scores were compared to the baseline score. The well-validated Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire is self-administered, has 21 questions and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. The test measures perceived health-related QOL. Each question is scored from 0 to 5 on the Likert scale, where 0 is 'none', and 5 is 'very much'. QOL scores range from 0 to 105; a lower score represents a better quality of life. After an intervention, a decrease in score reflects an improvement in QOL. A minimally important difference in the total score is 5 points.</description>

    <measure>Change in Doppler Echocardiographic Parameters, Septal E/e' Ratio (E/e')</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Doppler echo allows non-invasive evaluation of diastolic cardiac function. The mitral inflow velocity (E) correlates with LV filling pressure, but is influenced by myocardial relaxation time (RT) and filling pressure. The early diastolic septal mitral annular tissue velocity (e') varies with RT alone. The unitless ratio of the E to e' velocities (E/e') is considered a reliable surrogate of LV filling pressure. Prediction of normal diastolic filling pressure is most reliable when E/e' is &lt; 8; and of abnormal filling pressure when E/e' is &gt; 15. The percent change is reported.</description>

Informed consent was obtained from 10 pts who were subsequently randomized and completed study protocols.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Pts meeting all inclusion criteria were most often excluded due to the presence of atrial fibrillation, being unable to perform the minimum exercise effort required, or walked &gt; 550 meters on the 6MW test.

          <title>Peak Oxygen Uptake (VO2)</title>
          <description>Integrative exercise performance is assessed using cardiopulmonary stress testing and expired gas analysis. The degree of reduction in peak or maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) has strong prognostic implications in HF pts. VO2 is measured as ml O2/kg/min. The modified Naughton treadmill protocol used increases the workload by approximately 3.5 ml O2/kg/min for each 2‐minute stage and maximizes performance. Normally, V02 can increase from a resting value of about 3.5 ml O2/kg/min to 10-15 times the resting value.</description>

          <title>6MW test distance</title>
          <description>The Six-minute Walk (6MW) test was designed and validated by the American Thoracic Society. It is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The 6MW test has the moderate ability to predict peak VO2 in patients with HF who walk less than 490 meters. Stronger correlation occurs in advanced heart failure where pts who walk less than 300 meters in 6 minutes have a low (&lt;10 mL/kg/min) peak VO2. Normal persons average a 6MW distance of 659±62 m (range 484–820 m). Males walk on average 59±13 m further than females.</description>

          <title>Quality of Life (QOL) Score</title>
          <description>Quality of Life (QOL) in HF patients is reproducibly measured by the well-validated Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire. It is self-administered, has 21 questions and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. The test measures perceived health-related QOL. Each question is scored from 0 to 5 on the Likert scale, where 0 is 'none', and 5 is 'very much'. QOL scores range from 0 to 105; a lower score represents a better quality of life. After an intervention, a decrease in score reflects an improvement in QOL. A minimally important difference in the total score is 5 points.</description>

          <title>Septal E/e' Doppler velocity ratio</title>
          <description>Doppler echo allows non-invasive evaluation of diastolic cardiac function. The mitral inflow velocity (E) correlates with LV filling pressure, but is influenced by myocardial relaxation time (RT) and filling pressure. The early diastolic septal mitral annular tissue velocity (e') varies with RT alone. The unitless ratio of the E to e' velocities (E/e') is considered a reliable surrogate of LV filling pressure. Prediction of normal diastolic filling pressure is most reliable when E/e' is &lt; 8; and of abnormal filling pressure when E/e' is &gt; 15.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life (QOL) Score</title>
        <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (HF) Questionnaire was re-administered at the 6 week time point. The total quality of life (QOL) scores were compared to the baseline score. The well-validated Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire is self-administered, has 21 questions and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. The test measures perceived health-related QOL. Each question is scored from 0 to 5 on the Likert scale, where 0 is 'none', and 5 is 'very much'. QOL scores range from 0 to 105; a lower score represents a better quality of life. After an intervention, a decrease in score reflects an improvement in QOL. A minimally important difference in the total score is 5 points.</description>

        <title>Change in Doppler Echocardiographic Parameters, Septal E/e' Ratio (E/e')</title>
        <description>Doppler echo allows non-invasive evaluation of diastolic cardiac function. The mitral inflow velocity (E) correlates with LV filling pressure, but is influenced by myocardial relaxation time (RT) and filling pressure. The early diastolic septal mitral annular tissue velocity (e') varies with RT alone. The unitless ratio of the E to e' velocities (E/e') is considered a reliable surrogate of LV filling pressure. Prediction of normal diastolic filling pressure is most reliable when E/e' is &lt; 8; and of abnormal filling pressure when E/e' is &gt; 15. The percent change is reported.</description>
