  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential
      immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. In an effort to
      overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, Gradalis has designed a novel
      autologous vaccine to address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen
      recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen--&gt;immunogen), effector potency, and
      cancer-induced resistance. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer
      vaccines, we designed a novel dual-modulatory autologous whole cell vaccine, Vigil™,
      incorporating the rhGMCSF transgene and the bifunctional shRNAfurin (to block proprotein
      conversion to active TGFb1 and b2) to 1) address the inability to fully identify cancer
      associated antigens, 2) effect antigen recognition by the immune system, 3) enhance effector
      potency, and 4) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune resistance. We have also completed
      the Phase I assessment of Vigil™ vaccine in 30 advanced solid tumor patients (1.0 x 10^7
      cells/injection/month for a maximum of 12 vaccinations) who have not experienced any
      significant adverse effects following 144 vaccinations, including 6 patients with colorectal
      carcinoma. Plasmid functionality, immune biomarker response, and preliminary evidence of
      anticancer activity have been observed. This is a two-part Phase II study of the Vigil™
      autologous vaccine. Six patients will be enrolled into the Part 1 of the study to receive
      intradermal autologous Vigil™ cancer vaccine (1.0 x 10^7 cells/injection; maximum of 12
      vaccinations). Part 2 of the study will be a randomized Phase II study of sandwich or
      adjuvant chemotherapy and intradermal autologous Vigil™ cancer vaccine (1.0 x 10^7
      cells/injection; maximum of 12 vaccinations) versus sandwich or adjuvant chemotherapy and
      placebo in patients with colorectal carcinoma with either synchronous or metachronous liver
      metastases (CLM +/= pulmonary metastases) following resection +/= ablation with curative
      intent.Sandwich therapy indicates a combination of both pre-operative and postoperative
      chemotherapy as opposed to neo-adjuvant (all chemotherapy prior to surgery) or adjuvant (all
      chemotherapy following surgery) therapy. A minimum harvest aliquot to produce 4 monthly
      injections will be required for entry into the study. Patients in whom insufficient tissue
      (&lt;4 doses) is collected or whose vaccine fails manufacturing release criteria will not
      receive vaccine.
