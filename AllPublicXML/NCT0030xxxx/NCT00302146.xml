      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) to compare how people with Gaucher
      disease or Gaucher disease carriers with parkinsonism, and their family members, use dopamine
      in their brains in comparison with healthy normal volunteers and people who have Parkinson
      disease. PET assesses organ function by measuring metabolism. In this study, magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) is used in conjunction with PET to help better interpret and
      understand the information gleaned from PET.

      People 21 years of age and older with the following conditions may be eligible for this
      study:

        -  Gaucher disease and parkinsonism

        -  Parkinsonism and a family history of Gaucher disease

        -  Gaucher disease and a family history of parkinsonism

        -  Gaucher disease carriers who have parkinsonism or a family history of parkinsonism

        -  Unaffected people with a family history of Gaucher disease and parkinsonism

        -  Healthy volunteers

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Personal and family medical history

        -  Physical examination

        -  PET scan: The subject lies on a table that slides into the PET scanner until his or her
           head is positioned properly in the scanner. A catheter is inserted into a vein. An
           initial scan is done to obtain images before radionuclides are injected. Radioactive
           water is then injected through the catheter and the subject is asked questions in order
           to stimulate blood flow in certain areas of the brain to show what parts of the brain
           are activated. Fluorodopa is then infused through the catheter over 3 minutes. The PET
           scan can last up to 2 hours.

        -  MRI scan: This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of organs.
           The subject lies still on a bed in the middle of a circular scanner for about 30
           minutes.

    <textblock>
      An association between Gaucher disease and parkinsonism has been demonstrated by the
      concurrence of parkinsonian manifestations in patients with Gaucher disease and an increased
      incidence of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations in subjects with parkinsonism of various
      ethnicities. Furthermore, there is a significant number of obligate and confirmed Gaucher
      carriers with parkinsonian manifestations. Thus, alterations in GBA appear to be a more
      common risk factor than previously thought for the development of sporadic Parkinson disease
      and related disorders. However, in affected and at-risk individuals, the identification and
      characterization of early parkinsonian manifestations, and the rate of progression of
      symptoms have not been studied comprehensively and longitudinally. This in-vivo study employs
      multiple imaging modalities to better define the phenotype in GBA1-associated parkinsonism,
      follow disease progression, and identify at-risk individuals. The subjects include patients
      with Gaucher disease and Gaucher carriers with parkinsonian manifestations. In addition,
      clinically unaffected but at-risk individuals carrying GBA mutations, with and without a
      family history of parkinsonism will also be included. The control groups consist of
      individuals with Gaucher disease but no parkinsonian symptoms and relatives of probands
      without GBA mutations as well as PD patients without GBA mutations and healthy volunteers
      enrolled in NIMH clinical protocols. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 6-[F-18]
      Fluoro-L-Dopa (6FD) is used to evaluate presynaptic dopaminergic function, where 6FD uptake
      in putamen and striatum is employed as a measure of neuronal structural integrity in the
      substantia nigra. H2 15O PET is used to evaluate changes in resting regional cerebral blood
      flow (rCBF) associated with regional changes in cortical synaptic activity and metabolism.
      Each subject is screened with an MRI to rule-out anatomic brain abnormalities, and to further
      delineate areas of interest in the PET scans. Subjects also undergo transcranial
      ultrasonography (TCS) to assess the substantia nigra. The results of both the PET scans and
      TCS will be kept confidential, and will not be communicated to the individuals or families
      involved in the study. In addition to the imaging studies, all patients will undergo a
      physical and neurological examination, neurocognitive evaluation, olfactory testing and will
      be surveyed for potential non- motor manifestations.

        The study will include adult subjects age 21 or older. There will be two major study
        groups. The first will include subjects with parkinsonism to better characterize the
        parkinsonian phenotype and the second group will have unaffected yet at-risk individuals
        with or without a first degree family member with parkinsonism to explore early signs and
        symptoms of disease. Control subjects will include individuals without GBA1 mutations.
        Subjects with sporadic PD and healthy volunteers who do not have a family history of
        parkinsonism or Gaucher disease will be enrolled as control subjects.

        with a first degree family member with parkinsonism.

        Controls will include subjects without GBA1 mutations, with sporadic PD and healthy
        volunteers who do not have a family history of parkinsonism or Gaucher disease.

        Healthy Volunteers and Control subjects will be matched for age, gender and handedness for
        statistical purposes.

        The subjects excluded from the study are those:

          1. With severe cognitive deficits impairing decision making

          2. Unable or medically unsafe to withdraw from their current medications, such as
             subjects on SSRIs and other psychoactive drugs.
