      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Raptiva (efalizumab) in the
      treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic
      disorder, which may lead to permanent and progressive loss of hair. Lupus is a condition of
      chronic inflammation cause by an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses which
      occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a
      complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents, for example,
      bacteria, and other foreign invaders.

      One of the mechanisms that the immune system uses to fight infections is the production of
      antibodies. Patients with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target
      tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. Lupus can cause disease
      of the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, joints, and nervous system. When only the skin is
      involved, the condition is called discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE).

      Raptiva (efalizumab) is a humanized immunoglobulin(a protein extract from blood which fights
      off infection-sometimes called &quot;antibody&quot;), which targets the immune cells that are activated
      in inflammation. Raptiva has been approved for use in the management of psoriasis at doses of
      1mg/kg, but is not approved for the treatment of DLE.

      This is an open label study in which the subject will be given the medication Raptiva
      (efalizumab) and they will be taught to self-inject by the dermatology nurse or research
      doctor. The subject will be administering 0.7mg/kg at week one and 1mg/kg once a week
      thereafter until week 24. If the subject feels uncomfortable self-administering these
      injections, the subject may identify a caregiver to administer these injections for them. He
      or she will be taught to administer these injections by the dermatology nurse or research
      doctor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adults with discoid lupus erythematosus with active area of disease involving at least
             10% of scalp, confirmed by biopsy, bacterial and fungal culture negative.

          -  ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study.

          -  adults 18 to 70 years of age.

          -  if a female of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test and commitment to the
             use of two forms of effective contraception (birth control) for the duration of the
             study are necessary.

          -  if a non-sterile male, commitment to the use of two forms of effective contraception
             (birth control) for the duration of the study is necessary.

          -  Platelets &gt;100,000

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with known hypersensitivity to Raptiva (efalizumab) or any of its components

          -  pregnant or lactating women

          -  patients receiving immunosuppressive agents (not allowed 30 days or 5 half-live
             periods before Day 0, whichever is longer).

          -  prior enrollment in the study

          -  any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated.

          -  participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial

          -  history of malignancy in the last 10 years.

          -  signs or symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus.

          -  have a history of active tuberculosis or are currently undergoing treatment for
             tuberculosis. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test or chest x-ray will be
             performed at the screening visit. Patients with a positive PPD test or chest x-ray
             will be excluded.
