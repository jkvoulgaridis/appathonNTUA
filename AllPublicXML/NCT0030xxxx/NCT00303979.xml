      The purpose of this study is to characterize current management of patients with either heart
      failure or prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction and to assess the
      effect of education, specific clinical guidelines, reminder systems, comprehensive disease
      state management tools, benchmarked quality reports, and academic detailing on the use of
      evidence-based heart failure therapies in cardiology practices. This study is a quality
      improvement initiative that is being conducted through review of patient records.

      IMPROVE HF, the largest US outpatient HF patient registry, has substantially contributed to
      our knowledge of how systolic HF and post MI left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD)
      patients are treated in the outpatient setting.

      The findings of IMPROVE HF clearly support this guideline and may help to establish a model
      framework for future performance improvement programs for outpatient cardiology practices.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To Evaluate Over the Aggregate IMPROVE-HF Practice Sites the Relative Changes in 7 Performance Measures at 24 Months Compared With Baseline and Determine the Number of Performance Measures That Achieved a Relative 20% or Greater Positive Change.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Month</time_frame>
    <description>7 performance measures: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta-blokers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P/CRT-D), cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD/CRT-D), heart failure (HF) education.
We first calcuated % of patients who were eligible for a performance measure that were treated by it at baseline and 24 months. We then calculated the relative change as (% treated at 24 months - % treated at baseline)/% treated at baseline. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and the relative change of each performance measure was evaluated using a z-test for one-sample proportion.
The number of performance measures with &gt;= 20% relative improvement was determined. The intervention was considered successful if a relative 20% or greater improvement in at least 2 of the 7 performance measures at 24 months compared with baseline was achieved.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observe the Number of Sites That Demonstrate a Relative 20% or Greater Improvement in 2 or More of the 7 Performance Measures at 24 Months as Compared to Baseline in Cohort A.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of practices that achieved greater than or equal to 20% improvement in two or more of the 7 performance measures at 24 months as compared to baseline of cohort A is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observe the Change From Baseline to 24 Months in Each Performance Measure and Composite Score for the Aggregate Practices.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>performance measure improvement for each performance measure was analyzed at a practice level from baseline to 24 months. Performance measure adherence was calculated at the individual practice level and then combined and summarized. Mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals for performance measure adherence, composite score and relative change (24 months compared with baseline) are reported.
The Composite Score is based on the ratio of the sum of the numerators of all individual performance measures to the sum of the denominators of all individual performances measures. The numerator of a performance measure is the number of patients treated with that measure. The denomiator of a performance measure is the number of patients eligible for being treated with that measure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study sites included outpatient cardiology practices in the United States. Patients diagnosed with heart failure or prior myocardial infarction or developed moderate-severe left ventricular dysfunction were included. Each cardiology practice had five chart reviews and an educational workshop as a part of the process improvement intervention.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study included 3 mutually exclusive patient cohorts. Patients in cohort A were reviewed at baseline, 12 and 24 months. This is also called the longitudinal cohort. Patients in cohort B and C were reviewed at 6 and 18 months, respectively. These two cohorts are referred to as the single time point cohorts.</pre_assignment_details>

The tools included tip cards, worksheets, and patient education materials. Cohort A is a longitudinal cohort.</description>

        <title>To Evaluate Over the Aggregate IMPROVE-HF Practice Sites the Relative Changes in 7 Performance Measures at 24 Months Compared With Baseline and Determine the Number of Performance Measures That Achieved a Relative 20% or Greater Positive Change.</title>
        <description>7 performance measures: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta-blokers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P/CRT-D), cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD/CRT-D), heart failure (HF) education.
We first calcuated % of patients who were eligible for a performance measure that were treated by it at baseline and 24 months. We then calculated the relative change as (% treated at 24 months - % treated at baseline)/% treated at baseline. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and the relative change of each performance measure was evaluated using a z-test for one-sample proportion.
The number of performance measures with &gt;= 20% relative improvement was determined. The intervention was considered successful if a relative 20% or greater improvement in at least 2 of the 7 performance measures at 24 months compared with baseline was achieved.</description>
        <time_frame>24 Month</time_frame>
        <population>167 practices contributed data to the baseline chart review. Twelve of the practices withdrew from the study prior to the next chart review milestone. 155 of those practices’ data contributed to the follow up of the longitudinal cohort time points of 12 and 24 months post educational workshop.</population>

Of them, 12 practices withdrew from the study prior to the next chart review milestone. Therefore, 155 practices' data contributed to the follow up of the longitudinal cohort time points of 12 and 24 months post educational workshop. Correspondingly there were 7605 patients whose chart review was completed at both baseline and 24 months.</description>

        <title>Observe the Change From Baseline to 24 Months in Each Performance Measure and Composite Score for the Aggregate Practices.</title>
        <description>performance measure improvement for each performance measure was analyzed at a practice level from baseline to 24 months. Performance measure adherence was calculated at the individual practice level and then combined and summarized. Mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals for performance measure adherence, composite score and relative change (24 months compared with baseline) are reported.
The Composite Score is based on the ratio of the sum of the numerators of all individual performance measures to the sum of the denominators of all individual performances measures. The numerator of a performance measure is the number of patients treated with that measure. The denomiator of a performance measure is the number of patients eligible for being treated with that measure.</description>
