      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy
      together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which schedule of
      temozolomide when given together with radiation therapy is more effective in treating
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different schedules of temozolomide
      to compare how well they work when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients
      with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if dose-intensifying (increasing the &quot;dose-density&quot;) the adjuvant temozolomide
           component of the chemoradiation treatment enhances treatment efficacy as measured by
           overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if dose-intensifying the adjuvant temozolomide component of the chemoradiation
           treatment enhances treatment efficacy as measured by progression-free survival.

        -  Determine in patients with unmethylated MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)
           if dose-intensifying the adjuvant temozolomide component of the chemoradiation treatment
           enhances treatment efficacy (overall and progression-free survival) compared with
           patients receiving conventional temozolomide dosing.

        -  Determine in patients with methylated MGMT if dose-intensifying the adjuvant
           temozolomide component of the chemoradiation treatment enhances treatment efficacy
           (overall and progression-free survival) compared with patients receiving conventional
           temozolomide dosing.

        -  Determine if there is an association between tumor MGMT gene methylation status and
           treatment response.

        -  Compare and record the toxicities of the conventional and dose-intense chemotherapy
           regimens.

        -  Evaluate whether 6-month progression-free survival is associated with overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      recursive partitioning analysis class (III vs IV vs V), MGMT gene methylation status
      (methylated vs nonmethylated vs indeterminate), and radiotherapy criteria used (standard vs
      revised European).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Histopathologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma. Since gliosarcoma is a variant
             of glioblastoma, gliosarcoma is also an eligible diagnosis.

          2. Patients must have at least 1 block of tissue available for analysis of MGMT status;
             fresh frozen tumor tissue acquisition is encouraged.

          3. Diagnosis must be established by open biopsy or tumor resection. Patients who have
             only had a stereotactic biopsy are not eligible.

          4. The tumor must have a supratentorial component.

          5. Patients must have recovered from the effects of surgery, postoperative infection, and
             other complications before study registration.

          6. A diagnostic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized
             tomography (CT) scan (if MRI is not available) of the brain must be performed
             preoperatively and postoperatively. The postoperative scan must be done within 28 days
             of registration and prior to the initiation of radiotherapy. Preoperative and
             postoperative scans must be the same type. If CT scans were performed perioperatively,
             a CT and an MRI should be performed before randomization.

             6.1. Patients unable to undergo MRI imaging because of non-compatible devices can be
             enrolled, provided pre- and post-operative contrast-enhanced CT scans are obtained and
             are of sufficient quality.

          7. Therapy must begin ≤ 5 weeks after the most recent brain tumor surgery.

          8. History/physical examination within 14 days prior to study registration.

          9. Neurologic examination within 14 days prior to study registration.

         10. Documentation of steroid doses within 14 days prior to study registration and stable
             or decreasing steroid dose within 5 days prior to registration.

         11. Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60.

         12. Age ≥ 18 years.

         13. Complete blood count (CBC)/differential obtained within 14 days prior to study
             registration, with adequate bone marrow function as defined below: 13.1 Absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/mm3. 13.2 Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3. 13.3
             Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl. (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve
             Hgb ≥ 10 g/dl is acceptable.)

         14. Adequate renal function, as defined below:

             14.1 Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≤ 25 mg/dl within 14 days prior to study registration
             14.2 Creatinine ≤ 1.7 mg/dl within 14 days prior to study registration

         15. Adequate hepatic function, as defined below:

             15.1 Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl within 14 days prior to study registration 15.2 Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x normal range within 14 days prior to study registration
             15.3 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x normal range within 14 days prior to study
             registration

         16. Patients must sign a study-specific informed consent prior to study registration.

             If the patient's mental status precludes his/her giving informed consent, written
             informed consent may be given by the responsible family member.

         17. For females of child-bearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours
             prior to starting temozolomide.

         18. Women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice adequate

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Prior invasive malignancy (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease
             free for ≥ 3 years. (For example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity, and
             cervix are all permissible).

          2. Recurrent or multifocal malignant gliomas

          3. Metastases detected below the tentorium or beyond the cranial vault.

          4. Prior chemotherapy or radiosensitizers for cancers of the head and neck region; note
             that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable. Prior use of Gliadel
             wafers or any other intratumoral or intracavitary treatment are not permitted. See
             Section 1.

          5. Prior radiotherapy to the head or neck (except for T1 glottic cancer), resulting in
             overlap of radiation fields.

          6. Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               -  6.1. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization.

               -  6.2. Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.

               -  6.3. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the
                  time of registration.

               -  6.4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory
                  illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of
                  registration.

               -  6.5. Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation
                  defects; note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for entry into this protocol.

               -  6.6. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for
                  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing
                  is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with
                  AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this
                  protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.

               -  6.7. Major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the
                  investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol
                  therapy.

               -  6.8. Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, that in
                  the opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for
                  radiation toxicity.

          7. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

          8. Pregnant or lactating women, due to possible adverse effects on the developing fetus
             or infant due to study drug;

          9. Prior allergic reaction to temozolomide.

         10. Patients treated on any other therapeutic clinical protocols within 30 days prior to
             study entry or during participation in the study.

         11. No tissue provided for histopathologic central review and MGMT status.

         12. Tissue provided by stereotactic biopsy method.

        <title>Median Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time</title>
        <description>Progression is defined as greater than 25% increase in tumor area (two diameters) provided that the patient has not had his/her dose of steroids decreased since the last evaluation period. Progression-free survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of first progression, death, or last known follow-up (censored). Progression-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A concomitant decrease in steroid dose will rule out a progression designation during the first 2 months after completion of radiation therapy. Analysis occurred after 647 deaths were reported.</description>

        <title>Median Progression-free Survival Time by MGMT Status</title>
        <description>Progression is defined as greater than 25% increase in tumor area (two diameters) provided that the patient has not had his/her dose of steroids decreased since the last evaluation period. Progression-free survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of first progression, death, or last known follow-up (censored). Progression-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A concomitant decrease in steroid dose will rule out a progression designation during the first 2 months after completion of radiation therapy. Tumor tissue submitted at baseline was analyzed to determine MGMT (O[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promoter methylation status (methylated / unmethylated). Analysis occurred after 647 deaths were reported.</description>

        <population>MGMT status was not available for all randomized eligible participants. Therefore, data was only available from 376/411 on the conventional arm and 384/420 on the dose-dense arm.</population>

          <title>Distribution of Highest Grade AE Reported as Possibly/Probably/Definitely Related to Protocol Treatment</title>
          <description>Highest grade adverse event (AE) per subject was counted. Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to AE. Analysis occurred after 647 deaths were reported.</description>

        <description>The MDASI-BT is a 28-item patient-reported outcome measure assessing symptom severity and resulting interference with daily living in brain cancer patients. All items range from 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). The symptom severity score is the average of the symptom severity items, given a specified minimum numbers were completed. A score worse than baseline by at least one is considered deterioration.

        <title>Number of Participants With Deterioration From Baseline in MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) Symptom Severity Score and EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status Score (GHS) at Cycle 1</title>
        <description>The MDASI-BT is a 28-item patient-reported outcome measure assessing symptom severity (SS) and resulting interference with daily living in brain cancer patients. All items range from 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). A SS score is the average of the SS items, given a specified minimum numbers were completed. A score worse than baseline by at least one is considered deterioration.
Global Health Status is calculated from two questions on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ]-C30. The question responses range from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent) such that a higher response indicates better quality of life (QOL). The mean of these responses is linearly transformed to a range of 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A score worse than baseline by at least 10 is considered deterioration.
The 2x2 frequency table of SS deterioration vs. GHS deterioration is presented as four rows.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Deterioration From Baseline in MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) Symptom Severity Score and EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status Score (GHS) at Cycle 4</title>
        <description>The MDASI-BT is a 28-item patient-reported outcome measure assessing symptom severity (SS) and resulting interference with daily living in brain cancer patients. All items range from 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). A SS score is the average of the SS items, given a specified minimum numbers were completed. A score worse than baseline by at least one is considered deterioration.
Global Health Status is calculated from two questions on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ]-C30. The question responses range from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent) such that a higher response indicates better quality of life (QOL). The mean of these responses is linearly transformed to a range of 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A score worse than baseline by at least 10 is considered deterioration.
The 2x2 frequency table of SS deterioration vs. GHS deterioration is presented as four rows.</description>

        <title>Determination of Impactful Baseline Instruments on Overall Survival</title>
        <description>Overall survival time is defined as time from registration/randomization to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ]-C30 subscales are calculated as the mean of component items, then standardized such that subscale scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a healthy level of functioning. Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) score is the sum of correct responses with a range of 0 to infinity. A higher score indicates better functioning. Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) score ranges from 0 to 36 for total recall is 0 to 36, 0 to 12 for delayed recall, and -12 to 12 for recognition. A higher score indicates better functioning.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization to last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 4.4 years.</time_frame>
        <population>Both arms are combined per the protocol. Questionnaires/assessments were not completed by all QOL population participants. Therefore, only 154/191 have COWA, EORTC QLQ-C30, and HVLT-R baseline assessments (final model covariates)</population>

        <description>The MDASI-BT is a 28-item patient-reported outcome measure assessing symptom severity (SS) and resulting interference with daily living in brain cancer patients. All items range from 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). A SS score is the average of the SS items, given a specified minimum numbers were completed. A score worse than baseline by at least one is considered deterioration.
The HVLT-R Delayed Recognition raw score is the number of of correctly identified words minus the number of incorrectly identified words from a list of words including 12 nouns memorized 20 minutes prior. The raw score ranges from -12 to 12. with a higher score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized (mean 0, standard deviation 1), adjusting for age,education, and gender as necessary. A score worse than baseline by at least two is considered deterioration.
The 2x2 frequency table of SS deterioration vs. HVLT-R deterioration is presented as four rows.</description>
