      This study will collect further basic safety data on participants with cancer treated with
      enzastaurin. This study is not open to the public.

      The purpose of the this study is to extend the clinical experience of participants who
      complete enzastaurin therapy per clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutics studies conducted
      by Eli Lilly and Company and who may benefit from continued enzastaurin therapy.

    <description>Data presented are the number of participants who experienced 1 or more AEs or any serious AEs (SAEs) regardless of causality. A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs is located in the Reported Adverse Events section of this report.</description>

    <measure>Time to Disease Progression (Time to Documented Tumor Activity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion (up to 26 months and 30-day safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression was defined as the time in months from study enrollment to the first date of progressive disease. Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. Progressive Disease was defined as having at least a 20% increase in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of the last follow-up for participants who did not experience progressive disease, death, or their disease status was unknown.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response (Documented Antitumor Activity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion (up to 26 months and 30-day safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0) criteria. Complete Response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Progressive Disease was defined as having at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Stable Disease was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria. Also, reported were unknown and missing responses. Percentage of participants was calculated as the total number of participants affected divided by the number of participants analyzed then multiplied by 100.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  You must have previously participated in and finished Study H6Q-LC-JCAV (JCAV), Study
             H6Q-LC-JCAY (JCAY), or other enzastaurin clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutics
             studies. If you have had any other cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiation,
             anti-cancer hormone therapy), you must have completed it at least 4 weeks ago before
             you can enroll in this study.

          -  You must have a cancer for which no other therapy exists that can prolong your life.
             This may include participants with treated, stable brain cancer.

          -  You must have lesions (areas of cancer in your body) that your doctor can either
             measure or detect.

          -  You either must not be able to become pregnant, (because you've had surgery [&quot;tubes
             tied&quot; or hysterectomy], you've gone through menopause, or you've had previous
             radiation for cancer that made you sterile) or your potential to become pregnant must
             be reduced by the use of an approved birth control method (including intrauterine or
             barrier devices) during and for 3 to 6 months following the study.

          -  You can be either male or female, and must be at least 18 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  You must not have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug other than
             enzastaurin that is still experimental (this means it has not received approval to be
             prescribed, except in a clinical trial).

          -  You must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  You must not have central nervous system (CNS) tumors (tumors in your brain and spinal
             cord). (However, participants who have stable CNS tumors and are taking steroid
             medication may be included.)

          -  You must not have another serious disorder, including active infections that will
             interfere with your participation in the study.

          -  You must not have a second cancer in addition to your primary cancer. Participants
             with adequately treated skin cancer or who have had another cancer in the past, but
             have been cancer free for more than 2 years, are eligible.

          <description>Disease stage describes how big the tumor is and how far it has spread from the site of origin. Stages ranged from I (cancer is small and hasn't spread to the lymph nodes) to IV (cancer has spread throughout the body). Stage II has localized growth with no metastasis and is further differentiated based on the tumor size by Stage IIA (smaller) to Stage IIC (larger).</description>

          <description>ECOG performance status was used to classify participants according to their functional impairment. Score 0 = fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction. Score 1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, for example, light house work, office work. Score 2 = ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.</description>

Partial Response was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.
