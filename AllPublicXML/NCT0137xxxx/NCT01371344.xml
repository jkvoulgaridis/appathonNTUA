  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, a follow up to study FG506-CL-0403, is to see how safe and
      effective Modigraf® is (Part A) and to see how safe and effective it is to change your
      child's medication from Modigraf® to Prograf® (Part B).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To monitor the safety and efficacy of Modigraf® (tacrolimus granules) in stable paediatric
      allograft recipients (Part A) and to monitor dose changes and tacrolimus whole blood trough
      levels after conversion from a Modigraf based Immunosuppression regimen to a Prograf® based
      Immunosuppression regimen (Part B).
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Trial will not complete until at least 2025 and evolution of immunosuppressant therapy has made
    it unlikely that patients will convert from Modigraf to Prograf.

    <measure>Part A: Number of Participants with Acute Rejection Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rejection episodes/acute rejections are indicated by clinical and/or laboratory signs, and are classified according to their rejection specific treatment: •Spontaneously Resolving Acute Rejection: not treated with new or increased corticosteroid medication, antibodies or any other medication and resolved, irrespective of any tacrolimus dose changes; •Corticosteroid Sensitive Acute Rejection: treated with new or increased corticosteroid medication only and which has resolved, irrespective of any tacrolimus dose changes; •Corticosteroid Resistant Acute Rejection: did not resolve following treatment with corticosteroids; - Resolved with further treatment: any acute rejection with an end date AND a treatment other than corticosteroid used; - Unresolved with further treatment: any acute rejection with no end date AND a treatment other than corticosteroid used; - Unresolved with no further treatment: any acute rejection with no end date AND ONLY corticosteroid treatment used.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A; Number of Participants with Biopsy-proven Acute Rejection Episodes (BPARs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BPAR episodes are defined as acute rejection episodes confirmed by biopsy, and are classified according to their rejection specific treatment: •Spontaneously Resolving Acute Rejection: not treated with new or increased corticosteroid medication, antibodies or any other medication and resolved, irrespective of any tacrolimus dose changes; •Corticosteroid Sensitive Acute Rejection: treated with new or increased corticosteroid medication only and which has resolved, irrespective of any tacrolimus dose changes; •Corticosteroid Resistant Acute Rejection: did not resolve following treatment with corticosteroids; - Resolved with further treatment: any acute rejection with an end date AND a treatment other than corticosteroid used; - Unresolved with further treatment: any acute rejection with no end date AND a treatment other than corticosteroid used; - Unresolved with no further treatment: any acute rejection with no end date AND ONLY corticosteroid treatment used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Severity of BPARs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of BPARs is categorized with specific criteria by organ: For kidney transplant participants, according to Banff '97 Diagnostic categories for renal allograft biopsies - Banff '07 update (C4d deposition, Acute antibody-mediated rejection I, II, and III, Acute T cell mediated rejection IA, IB, IIA, IIB and III); for liver transplant participants, according to 1997 Banff Schema for Grading of Liver Allograft Rejection - Rejection Activity Index score (sum of grades: 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe; range from 0-9); for heart, according to Standardized Nomenclature of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation - Standardised Cardiac Biopsy Grading: Acute Cellular Rejection 2004 (mild, moderate, severe).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Patient Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient survival is reported as the number of deaths that occurred during Part A of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Graft Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Graft survival is reported as the number of participants who experienced graft loss. Graft loss is defined as retransplantation or death or return to pretransplantation treatment modality for 6 weeks or longer. Additionally, kidney transplanted participants with ongoing dialysis at the end of study is counted as participants with graft loss.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to 13 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is assessed by AEs, which includes abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, etc.) if the abnormality induces clinical signs or symptoms, needs active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or is clinically significant. A serious AE (SAE) is an event resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization or is considered medically important. A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE observed after investigational drug administration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Number of Dose Adjustments</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Study drug doses are adjusted based on clinical evidence of efficacy and occurrence of adverse events, and taking into consideration the recommended whole blood trough level range of 5-20 ng/ml.</description>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug (tacrolimus capsules) up to 7 days after last dose (up to 38 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is assessed by AEs, which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, etc.) if the abnormality induces clinical signs or symptoms, needs active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or is clinically significant. A SAE is an event resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization or is considered medically important.
