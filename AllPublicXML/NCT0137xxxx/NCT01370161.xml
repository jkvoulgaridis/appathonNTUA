  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether early use of transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) covered stents is able to
      prolong the survival in patients with advanced cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding.

    <description>Initial control of the bleeding episode will be obtained by vasoactive drugs (octreotide, somatostatin or terlipressin), endoscopic band ligation (sclerotherapy if technically difficult or not feasible) and prophylactic antibiotics.TIPS will be performed as soon as possible once the patients are enrolled in the study, always within the first 72 hours after the diagnostic endoscopy (preferably in the first 24 hours).Vasoactive drugs will be continued until the TIPS is performed and antibiotics will be continued for 5-7 days.</description>

    <description>Initial control of the bleeding episode will be obtained by vasoactive drugs (octreotide, somatostatin or terlipressin), endoscopic band ligation (sclerotherapy if technically difficult or not feasible) and prophylactic antibiotics.Patients will be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol)on day 5. In case of contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers, patients will not receive pharmacological treatment (beta-blockers) and the only treatment to prevent rebleeding will be endoscopic band ligation.</description>

    <description>A 8 mm Fluency stent will be used. The aim will be to reduce the portal pressure gradient (PPG) below to 12 mm Hg or 25-75% of baseline.
Embolisation, either with coils or bucrylate, can be performed, if it is felt necessary, especially in patients where portography shows the filling of large portosystemic collaterals feeding the varices.
After TIPS, anticoagulation will not be used as a rule, but is allowed if the attending physician thinks that it is warranted.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive vasoactive drugs up to 5 days; then a non-selective beta-blocker (propranolol) will be started with an initial dose of 40 mg, the dose of propranolol will be increased/decreased step by step to achieve a baseline heart rate of 55 bpm, or 25% reduction of basal heart rate or up to the maximum tolerated dose of propranolol.
The second elective session of endoscopic band ligation will be performed within the first 7-14 days after the initial endoscopic treatment. The following sessions will be performed at 14 +/- 3 days intervals until variceal eradication. Once eradication is achieved, endoscopic monitoring will be performed every 6 months. If varices reappear, new band ligation will be performed.</description>
