      Subject of the proposed study is the non-invasive in vivo imaging of bone, bone marrow and
      localized microcirculation in test animals with osteoporosis, fractures and after placement
      of bone substitute material with volume computed tomography (VCT) (animals only) and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      In vivo imaging by means of functional MRI and VCT is carried out in osteoporotic rats, both
      after the induction of fracture as well as after the placement of bone substitute material.

      Furthermore, patients with asymptomatic MM are investigated with functional MR-Imaging
      (Dynamic Contrast Enhancement- MRI and Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-imaging)
      longitudinally to predict the occurrence of osteolysis and the time to progression regarding
      SLIM-CRAB-Criteria (Rajkumar et al., Lancet Oncology, 2014).

      Hypothesis:

        1. Affection of microcirculation at the junction of bone and bone substitute material can
           be displayed by VCT and functional MRI

        2. Functional MRI has prognostic value regarding occurrence of osteolysis and progression
           to MM regarding SLIM-CRAB-Criteria

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an experimental study, rat models were used for imaging studies employing MRI
      (morphological, DCE- and DWI) and VCT. Mice were not used for imaging purposes due to the
      small size. Rats were shown to be of optimal size for small imaging studies.

      147 patients with (suspected) asymptomatic MM were recruited for dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of the vertebral column as well as
      whole-body MRI using T1tse and STIR images every 6 months until progression and/ or
      occurrence of first osteolysis.

      While during planning and initiation of this prospective trial MM was defined by
      CRAB-criteria only, in 2014 the SLIM-CRAB-criteria were proposed by the International Myeloma
      Working Group (Rajkumar et al., Lancet Oncology, 2014) with the goal to treat patients before
      development of osteolysis or other CRAB-criteria. These criteria were consequently introduced
      in clinical practice at our institution during the observation period of this study, which
      affects both inclusion and progression criteria of this study. In order to obtain a
      conclusive cohort with homogenous inclusion and progression criteria, SLIM-CRAB-criteria
      where retrospectively applied to restage all patients regarding inclusion and progression to
      MM defined by SLIM-CRAB-criteria.
