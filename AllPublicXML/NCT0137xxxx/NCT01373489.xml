      The purpose of this study is to help low income patients achieve and maintain better
      self-management skills and improve blood sugar levels, using a 2-in-1 blood glucose and blood
      pressure monitoring system and nurse case management. Patients must be served at a Federally
      Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in coastal South Carolina.

      The long-term goal is to develop a practical and sustainable system of diabetes management
      that will help low income patients achieve and maintain goals within established treatment
      guidelines regardless of geographic location. This randomized clinical trial will employ the
      innovative FORA system, an inexpensive, off-the-shelf, state-of-the-art technology comprised
      of a 2-in-1 Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure monitor, coupled with nurse case management
      (TACM) to optimize diabetes care for low income, rural adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
      The target population will be low income patients served in Federally Qualified Health Care
      Centers (FQHCs) with poorly controlled T2DM residing in coastal South Carolina. Two hundred
      patients will be randomly assigned to two groups of 100 patients each; Group A (Usual Care)
      and Group B (Technology-assisted Case Management, TACM). Each patient will be followed for 6
      months, with study visits at baseline, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome will be
      Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 months post-randomization while the secondary outcomes will be
      blood pressure control and quality of life (qol) at 6 months post-randomization.

    <description>The TACM intervention uses the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System for diabetes to link a case manager to poorly controlled diabetics in real time. Patients will be assigned the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System and provided glucose test strips to allow testing at least once a day. They will be asked to perform glucose testing and blood pressure measurement using the FORA system once daily. They will be asked to upload the measurements daily as soon as possible after the test is performed. The nurse case manager will have access to a secure server to which the uploaded measurements are stored in real time. Medications are titrated under supervision of a primary care and endocrinology physicians</description>

            <description>This model capitalizes on information technology like the FORA system to link a case manager to poorly controlled diabetics in real time. Clearly a model that is applicable only to patients in need of intensive intervention, the advantages includes accurate data transfer to a medical decision maker and positive reinforcement/feedback to the patient via the FORA system to enhance adherence. If the case manager has physician-supervised prescriptive authority, then medication adjustments can be made daily or weekly, if needed, to achieve and maintain control. More frequent interventions, combined with improved compliance with medications and testing frequency, the strategies that are known to work, are enabled by this approach.
