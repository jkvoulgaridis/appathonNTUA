          -  Ability to comprehend and sign consent to have data entered in the PNH Registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness to sign informed consent.

          -  Patients currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial for treatment of PNH
             cannot be enrolled in the Registry at the same time.
