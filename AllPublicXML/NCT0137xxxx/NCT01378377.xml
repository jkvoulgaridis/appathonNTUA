  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research trial is testing the experimental drug pimasertib and the drug Torisel, given
      together, in the treatment of advanced solid tumors. The primary purpose of the study is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      drug combination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The trial was stopped due to the toxicities observed with the combination of pimasertib and
    temsirolimus.

        <description>Clearance (CL) of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. The CL obtained after oral dose (CL/F) was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed (bioavailability).

        <description>Disease control is defined as confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) &gt;=12 weeks), based on tumor assessments as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. CR: The disappearance of all lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the sum of the longest diameter at baseline. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since treatment started.</description>
