      Background:

      - The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National
      Institutes of Health needs healthy volunteers for vaccine clinical trials. These trials will
      allow researchers to study vaccines and injection devices. These studies will also allow
      researchers to understand the immune system and how vaccines work. In this protocol,
      researchers will screen healthy volunteers for these future trials.

      Objectives:

      - To screen healthy volunteers for clinical trials at the NIAID.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy people between 18 years of age or older. They must be available to take part in
      clinical trials and be able to provide blood for research studies.

      Design:

        -  Screening for a clinical trial may begin several months before the vaccine clinical
           trial begins.

        -  Volunteers will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They may also
           answer questions about sexual activity and drug use.

        -  Volunteers will provide blood samples and possibly urine samples. They may have other
           tests as needed for the study.

        -  Volunteers will not receive any treatment in this screening trial.

      The purpose of this study is to screen potential study volunteers to determine if they are
      eligible for clinical trials of investigational products conducted by the Vaccine Research
      Center (VRC), NIAID, NIH at the NIH Clinical Center. Educational materials on the
      investigational products and protocols will be reviewed with and provided to subjects during
      participation in the screening protocol. Approximately 3,000 adults 18 years of age or older
      will be enrolled; however, the age ranges may be more restrictive for some clinical trials.
      Recruitment efforts at any given time will focus on the age ranges specified for the VRC
      studies that are in development or open to accrual.
