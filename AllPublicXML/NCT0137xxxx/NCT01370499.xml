  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Behaviors and Ideations Measured by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation was defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score and Individual Items</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items are rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Subscale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The &quot;Experience Score&quot; was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, the &quot;Impact Score&quot; was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only), and the &quot;Average Score&quot; was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression and Anxiety Subscale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. The anxiety subscale score is the sum of the 7 odd-numbered items and depression subscale score is the sum of the 7 even-numbered items, giving maximum scores of 21 for each subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a 'significant' case of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7, 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score and Subscale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS Global Functional Impairment Score (total score) and subscores were completed by the participant and were used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on his or her work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with high values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

    <description>LY2216684: 12 milligrams (mg) or 18 mg, administered orally, once daily for 52 weeks, adjunctive to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
During the open-label phase, all participants started at the 12 mg dose and could have the dose increased to 18 mg after the first week of treatment. During the first 12 weeks, participants were allowed (at scheduled or unscheduled visits) to decrease their dose to 12 mg based on response. After a decrease in dose to 12 mg, participants could have had an increase back up to 18 mg at any scheduled visit based on response and tolerability. After 12 weeks of treatment, participants maintained a stable dose.
Open-label treatment was followed by a 1-week abrupt discontinuation phase. Participants who either completed study visits through Week 52 or discontinued early from the study for any reason returned 1 week later for follow-up visit. Participants did not receive LY2216684 but continued their SSRI treatment at a stable dose.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>This is an open-label study with 1 treatment (12 or 18 milligrams [mg] LY2216684 + SSRI). However, the data were analyzed by the participants' treatment group from 2 parent studies (Study LNBM: NCT01173601 or Study LNBQ: NCT01187407). In these prior, parent studies, participants were randomized to receive Placebo + SSRI or LY2216684 + SSRI.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Suicidal Behaviors and Ideations Measured by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation was defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score and Individual Items</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items are rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Subscale Scores</title>
        <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The &quot;Experience Score&quot; was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, the &quot;Impact Score&quot; was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only), and the &quot;Average Score&quot; was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression and Anxiety Subscale Scores</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. The anxiety subscale score is the sum of the 7 odd-numbered items and depression subscale score is the sum of the 7 even-numbered items, giving maximum scores of 21 for each subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a 'significant' case of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7, 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression and Anxiety Subscale Scores</title>
          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. The anxiety subscale score is the sum of the 7 odd-numbered items and depression subscale score is the sum of the 7 even-numbered items, giving maximum scores of 21 for each subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a 'significant' case of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7, 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score and Subscale Scores</title>
        <description>The SDS Global Functional Impairment Score (total score) and subscores were completed by the participant and were used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on his or her work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Functional Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with high values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 52 Week Endpoint in Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Scale</title>
        <description>The Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) scale is used to assess sexual functioning in both males and females. The ASEX total score for the male and female version is calculated as the sum of the responses (rated from 1 [extremely] to 6 [no/never]) to the 5 items of the ASEX scale. Total scores ranged from 5 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for pooled investigative site and visit, baseline score, and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>
