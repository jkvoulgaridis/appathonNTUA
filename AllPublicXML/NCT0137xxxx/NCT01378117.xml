  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized pilot study to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin (Januvia) for the inpatient management of type 2
      diabetes (T2D) in general medicine and surgery patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood glucose levels in hospitalized patients with diabetes are associated with
      increased risk of medical complications and death. Improved glucose control with insulin
      injections may improve clinical outcome and prevent some of the hospital complications.
      Glargine (Lantus®) insulin injection is the most common treatment of diabetes in the
      hospital. Sitagliptin (Januvia®)is effective in lowering blood glucose, but has not been
      tested in the hospital. It is not known if sitagliptin is as effective in controlling blood
      sugars in the hospital. This study will compare sitagliptin by mouth, insulin (glargine)
      injection, and the combination of sitagliptin and lantus insulin in controlling blood sugar
      in hospitalized patients with diabetes.

      In this pilot study, patients with known history of diabetes treated with diet and/or oral
      anti-diabetics or with low total daily dose insulin therapy (&lt;0.4 unit/kg/day) will be
      randomized to receive sitagliptin once daily (group 1), sitagliptin plus basal (glargine)
      insulin once daily (group 2), or basal bolus regimen with glargine once daily and lispro
      insulin before meals (group 3). If needed, patients in the 3 treatment groups will receive
      correction doses of rapid-acting lispro (Humalog®) insulin in the presence of hyperglycemia
      (BG &gt; 140 mg/dl) per sliding scale. The overall hypothesis is that treatment with sitagliptin
      once daily alone or in combination with basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes will
      result in a similar improvement in glycemic control and in a lower frequency of hypoglycemic
      events than treatment with basal bolus insulin regimen with glargine once daily and lispro
      insulin before meals.

      A total of 90 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited in this study. Patients will be
      recruited at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University Hospital.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Hypoglycemic Events Among the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization,up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemia is defined as blood glucose (BG) reading &lt;70 mg/dl. The number of hypoglycemia events during hospitalization are recorded and compared among the different groups. BG was measured before each meal and at bedtime (or every 6 h if a patient was not eating) using a point-of-care glucose meter</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Severe Hypoglycemic Episodes Among the 3 Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization,up to 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>severe hypoglycemic episodes are defined as blood glucose levels &lt;40 mg/dl. The number of patients with these events during the 5 days of hospitalization are recorded and compared. BG was measured before each meal and at bedtime (or every 6 h if a patient was not eating) using a point-of-care glucose meter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With a Mean Daily BG &gt; 240 mg/dL After the 1st Day of Treatment Among the Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization,up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily blood glucose levels are measured to assess the treatment Failures. For study purpose Treatment failure was defined as having three or more consecutive Blood Glucose (BG) readings &gt; 240 mg/dL or a mean daily BG &gt;240 mg/dL after the 1st day of treatment. Number of patients with a mean daily BG &gt; 240 mg/dL after the 1st day of treatment are recorded and compared among the treatment groups. BG was measured before each meal and at bedtime (or every 6 h if a patient was not eating) using a point-of-care glucose meter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Total Daily Dose of Insulin in Units/Day Given During Hospitalization Among the Three Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization, up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The total insulin includes total glargine insulin (units/day) and total lispro insulin (units/day) given to subjects for maintaining blood glucose levels during hospitalization in different groups. The goal of therapy was to maintain a fasting and premeal glucose concentration between 100 and 140 mg/dL. The doses of insulin were adjusted daily according to protocol. The mean amount is calculated among the different groups and compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Acute Renal Failure Among the Three Randomized Groups During Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization, up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Acute renal failure is defined as a clinical diagnosis of acute renal failure with documented new-onset abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2.2 mg/dL or an increment &gt; 0.5 mg/dL from baseline). The total daily dose of insulin and sitagliptin will be adjusted as per serum creatinine concentration. The total daily insulin dose will be reduced to 0.3 unit/kg in patients with creatinine &gt;1.7 mg/dl. The dose of sitagliptin will be reduced to 50 mg/day in patients with creatinine clearance between 30-50 ml/min (approximate serum creatinine levels &gt;1.7 and ≤3.0 mg/dl for men and &gt;1.5 and ≤2.5 mg/dl for women).</description>

        <description>The total insulin includes total glargine insulin (units/day) and total lispro insulin (units/day) given to subjects for maintaining blood glucose levels during hospitalization in different groups. The goal of therapy was to maintain a fasting and premeal glucose concentration between 100 and 140 mg/dL. The doses of insulin were adjusted daily according to protocol. The mean amount is calculated among the different groups and compared.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Acute Renal Failure Among the Three Randomized Groups During Hospitalization</title>
        <description>Acute renal failure is defined as a clinical diagnosis of acute renal failure with documented new-onset abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt; 2.2 mg/dL or an increment &gt; 0.5 mg/dL from baseline). The total daily dose of insulin and sitagliptin will be adjusted as per serum creatinine concentration. The total daily insulin dose will be reduced to 0.3 unit/kg in patients with creatinine &gt;1.7 mg/dl. The dose of sitagliptin will be reduced to 50 mg/day in patients with creatinine clearance between 30-50 ml/min (approximate serum creatinine levels &gt;1.7 and ≤3.0 mg/dl for men and &gt;1.5 and ≤2.5 mg/dl for women).</description>
