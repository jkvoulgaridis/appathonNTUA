  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized study is to test the hypothesis that scores on the Bayley
      Scales of Infant Development-III (Bayley-III) are higher than scores on the Bayley Scales of
      Infant Development-II (BSID-II) in the same group of infants who were born very preterm.

      The objective of this randomized crossover study is to test the hypothesis that scores on the
      Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III are higher than scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development-II in the same group of infants who were born very preterm. First, however, the
      investigators must demonstrate that significant &quot;learning&quot; does not occur when the tests are
      administered 4-8 weeks apart. The investigators hypothesize that scores on the Bayley-III
      will be higher than scores on the BSID-II, irrespective of the order in which the tests are
      administered.

    <description>Individually administered test, designed to evaluate the developmental functioning of infants and small children, between 1 and 42 months of age. The purpose of the test is to identify infants and children with developmental delay. BSID-II was published in 1993. BSID-II provides normative data from two scales - Mental Development Index (MDI), and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI).</description>

The purpose of the test is to identify infants and children with developmental delay. BSID-III was released in 2006.
