  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial arrhythmia is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. It is a source of significant
      morbidity.

      Hypertension is a major risk factor for atrial arrhythmias. Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA)
      is a common cause of secondary hypertension, associated with a high prevalence of arrhythmias
      with a specific, sometimes curative, treatment. The purpose of the study is to show that the
      prevalence of PA among hypertensive patients under 65 years old with atrial arrhythmia is
      high, justifying systematic screening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial arrhythmia is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting one million patients in
      France. It is a source of significant morbidity, a major deterioration in the quality of life
      and considerable health expenditure.

      Hypertension is a major and modifiable risk factor for atrial arrhythmias. Primary
      hyperaldosteronism is a common cause of secondary hypertension, associated with a high
      prevalence of arrhythmias, but also stroke, coronary artery disease, heart and kidney
      failure. This form has a specific treatment, sometimes curative.

      The objective of this study is to show that the prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism
      among patients under 65 with atrial arrhythmias is high, justifying systematic screening in
      this population.

      The investigators will consecutively include 65-year-old hypertensive patients hospitalized
      in the department with atrialarrhythmia. They will benefit from an aldosterone to renin ratio
      assay under standardized conditions at 3 months.

      Patients whose aldosterone (pmol/l) to renin (mUI/l) ratio is greater than 64 will benefit
      from saline infusion test if necessary and adrenal scan. Patients with a definite diagnosis
      who would prefer surgical treatment will benefit from adrenal venous catheterization.
