  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in three parts. A single ascending
      dose (SAD) study in six cohorts receiving a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 1, 10, 30, 60,
      100, or 200 mg of rezafungin; a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in four cohorts receiving
      30 mg x 3 doses, 60 mg x 3 doses, 100 mg x 3 doses, or 200 mg x 3 doses of rezafungin SC with
      dosing frequency of once every 7 days; and a two-period cross-over bioavailability (BA) study
      receiving 100 mg of rezafungin. The two period cross-over BA study will be assessed unblinded
      in two sequences (10 subjects, 100 mg or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rezafungin in Part
      1); 5 subjects will receive an SC injection of rezafungin in Period 1 followed by an
      intravenous (IV) infusion of rezafungin in Period 2, and 5 subjects will receive an IV
      infusion of rezafungin in Period 1 followed by an SC injection of rezafungin in Period 2.
      Each SAD (except cohort 1) and MAD cohort will contain 8 subjects (6 subjects will receive a
      SC injection of rezafungin and 2 subjects will receive placebo). Each SAD (except cohort 1)
      and MAD cohort will be conducted with sentinel dosing. SAD cohort 1 will be comprised of 4
      subjects (3:1 rezafungin to placebo) with no sentinel dosing. Parts 2 and 3 of the study will
      only be conducted after FDA review for safety data and PK data from all subjects
      participating in Part 1; Part 3 may be run in parallel with the first cohort (Cohort 7) of
      Part 2. Individuals in the SAD cohorts will participate for approximately 58 days, including
      up to 28 days for screening and 30 days for dosing and follow-up (FU). Individuals in the MAD
      cohorts will participate for approximately 73 days, including up to 28 days for screening and
      45 days for dosing and FU. Individuals in the BA cohorts will participate for approximately
      80 days, including up to 28 days for screening and 52 days for dosing and FU. The study will
      have a duration of approximately 30 months. The primary objectives are to determine the: 1)
      safety and tolerability of single ascending SC doses (SAD) of rezafungin; 2) safety and
      tolerability of multiple ascending SC doses (MAD) of rezafungin; and 3) pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile in plasma of rezafungin in healthy adult subjects.

             protected health information.

          3. Willing and able to comply with protocol requirements, instructions, and
             protocol-stated restrictions (including confinement to the Clinical Research Unit) and
             is likely to complete the study as planned.

          4. Males must be vasectomized or agree to use barrier contraception (condom with
             spermicide) from first dose of study drug until at least 18 weeks following the last
             dose of study drug.

          5. Males must agree to refrain from sperm donation from first dose of investigational
             product (IP) through at least 18 weeks after last dose of IP.

          6. Females are eligible if they are of non-childbearing potential* or if they use a
             highly effective** method of contraception for 30 days prior to dosing and for a
             minimum of 30 days after dosing.

             *Non-childbearing potential is defined as: Pre-menopausal with documentation of
             irreversible surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             bilateral salpingectomy (but not tubal ligation alone); or, Post-menopausal defined as
             amenorrhea for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
             treatments and with Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels &gt; / = 40 mIU/mL at

          7. Subject is in good health as deemed by the Investigator*,**.

               -  Good health is defined by the absence of any medical condition described in the
                  exclusion criteria in a subject who undergoes a medical history, with a normal
                  complete physical examination including resting vital signs, and screening safety
                  laboratory testing.

                       months of enrollment; 2) is worsening in terms of clinical outcome in last 6
                       months; or 3) involves need for medication that may pose a risk to subject's
                       safety or significantly impede assessment of adverse events if they
