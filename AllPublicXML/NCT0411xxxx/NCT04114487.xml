      to the education of mentally disabled individuals is effective and necessary in terms of
      mental performance.

      Mental disability levels IQ = 50-79 individuals with mild / border mental disabilities will
      be included in the study. The disability status of the individuals will be determined by the
      health report, and the cognitive status of the individuals will be determined by the report
      given as a result of the evaluation made by the Guidance Research Centers of the National
      Education Directorates. The 45-person study group will be randomized to 3 groups of 15
      persons each. The first group will not be subjected to any application except education. The
      second group will be the control group and will be taken to the balance training in addition
      to normal education. In the third group, dual task balance training will be applied within
      the scope of cognitive rehabilitation

    <description>The studies were planned to be 2 times a week for 12 weeks. The 20-minute Dual Task balance training program is planned to be composed of two sections of 10 minutes. In the first 10 min section, the individual will exercise with the multi-task mode of CogniBoard on the balance ball. . Stroop study will be performed on the balance ball in the second 10 minutes of the exercise.</description>
