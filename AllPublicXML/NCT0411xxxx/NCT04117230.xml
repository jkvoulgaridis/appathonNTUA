      The project's main goal is to collect baseline clinical and procedural data as well as to
      assess clinical outcomes for all patients undergoing ECMO or Impella implantation at all
      included sites. All patients undergoing ECMO and/or IMPELLA implantation will be
      prospectively registered. Device use is according to the decision of the treating physician
      and independent of this registry.

      This prospective data collection is made up of an all-comers design, including all eligible
      consecutive patients receiving an Impella (2.5, 5, CP, or RP) or VA-ECMO device via femoral
      access who gave their consent (or, if not possible, their relative).

    <measure>Analysis of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification for participants</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification provides a way of classifying the extent of heart failure. It classifies patients in one of four categories based on their limitations during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regards to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and or angina pain. Class I is defined as no symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity worsening to Class IV defined as severe limitations.</description>
