      The principal investigator hypothesize that premature newborns have disturbed cardiac
      performance and increased pulmonary pressures during neonatal life and at different pediatric
      ages.

      The principal investigator also hypothesize that premature newborns with poor cardiac
      performance and/or pulmonary hypertension have higher morbidities and poorer
      neuro-developmental outcomes.

      The principal investigator also hypothesize that premature newborns with poor cardiac
      performance and/or pulmonary hypertension have higher morbidities and poorer
      neuro-developmental outcomes and that novel echocardiography techniques will detect anomalies
      not uncovered by conventional imaging, and that early echocardiography may identify those
      with later pulmonary hypertension.
