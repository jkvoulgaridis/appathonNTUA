  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thickened liquids are commonly used as an intervention for people with dysphagia (swallowing
      impairment). However, the field currently lacks a proper understanding of how this
      intervention works. The overall goal of the project is to collect measurements of bolus flow
      through the oropharynx (i.e., mouth and throat) during swallowing. The factors that are
      expected to influence bolus flow include the liquid/food consistency (i.e., thin,
      slightly-thick, mildly-thick, moderately-thick, extremely thick, solid) and the forces
      applied during swallowing (i.e., tongue pressures and swallowing muscle contraction). The
      objective is to determine how these factors interact to influence the flow of a bolus through
      the oropharynx in healthy swallowing.

      The aims of this study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To determine the relationship between bolus flow and healthy swallowing physiology.
      The investigators will collect concurrent videofluoroscopic and physiological measures of
      swallowing (tongue pressure, electromyography [sEMG]) in healthy adults using barium stimuli
      across the continuum of liquid consistency (thin, slightly thick, mildly thick, moderately
      thick and extremely thick liquids, as defined by the International Dysphagia Diet
      Standardisation Initiative, www.iddsi.org). Significance: This will show the impact of
      consistency on bolus flow through the oropharynx, controlling for the forces used to initiate
      flow and propel the bolus.

      Aim 2: To compare healthy swallowing physiology for barium versus non-barium stimuli. The
      investigators will collect physiological measures of swallowing using barium and non-barium
      stimuli matched for consistency. Significance: This will determine how swallowing behaviors
      (tongue pressures, sEMG) differ between barium and non-barium stimuli with matched
      consistency, enabling us to develop models of flow accounting for these differences.

      Aim 3: To compare healthy swallowing physiology across different commercial barium products.
      Significance: This will determine whether differences in barium concentration or brand
      influence swallowing behaviors, enabling us to make recommendations regarding ideal contrast
      agents for use in radiographic swallowing assessment.

      Aim 4: To explore swallowing behaviors across solid foods of different consistencies (minced
      and moist, soft &amp; bite-sized, regular) in comparison to liquids. Significance: This will
      provide preliminary data regarding swallowing physiology across these consistencies.

    <measure>Penetration-Aspiration Scale (Swallow Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (single timepoint only)</time_frame>
    <description>The Penetration-Aspiration Scale is an 8-point categorical scale that will be used to characterize swallowing safety for each bolus based on the depth to which any material enters the airway and whether or not the material is ejected. Levels 1 and 2 on the scale are considered safe, while levels &gt; 3 are considered unsafe. Actual scale scores (1-8) will be recorded and then converted to binary categorical scores (&lt; 3 vs &gt;/= 3).</description>
