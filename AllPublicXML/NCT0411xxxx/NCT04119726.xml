    <textblock>
      The RESCIND-3 study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. It will be
      conducted in the departments of cardiology in 5 hospitals. Guangdong General Hospital ethics
      review board approved the study's design. 400 patients with AMI on admission will be
      continuously enrolled and randomly allocated to either the control or intervention group. The
      intervention group will receive internet-based counseling, individual drug reminders,
      recommendations for healthy lifestyles, cardiovascular education about AMI, and follow-up
      reminders four times a week, while the control group will only receive cardiology knowledge
      and follow-up reminders four times a week. Mobile health tools (WeChat applet) were developed
      through cooperation with a technology company to establish appropriate It will be blinding
      for investigators but all participants will be aware of whether their intervention is the
      'experimental' treatment. Trained research nurses will conduct the follow up in the 4th, 8th,
      12th months by telephone or face-to-face visit. All the adverse events will be collected
      through a self-reported section in the mobile health tools. The study will evaluate the
      acceptability, utility of the intervention based on Internet consulting management.

      Background：Antithrombotic drugs, β-blockers, statins and angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are recommended for patients with
      acute myocardial infarction(AMI). However, discontinuation of the drugs was associated with
      higher mortality. Few studies focused on the improvement of drug compliance through mHealth
      tools.

      Objective：To investigate whether internet-based counseling could improve drug(Antithrombotic
      drugs, β-blockers, statins an ACEI/ARB) compliance following percutaneous coronary
      intervention(PCI) among patients with AMI within 1year's follow-up.

      Study design：The study is a multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-blinded study. A
      total of 400 AMI patients following PCI will be randomized to intervention group or control
      group in addition to usual post-MI care. The intervention group will receive internet-based
      counseling, personalized reminders(drug information, healthy lifestyles advise) and
      educational message (cardiovascular knowledge and follow-up reminders) four times a week. It
      will be only usual messages (cardiovascular knowledge and follow-up reminders) supported four
      times a week in the control group. The primary endpoint is the discontinuation rate of
      coronary heart disease secondary prevention drugs (antiplatelet, ACEI/ARB, beta-blockers, and
      statins). The second endpoints include drug adherence scores assessed by the proportion of
      days covered(PDC) and major adverse cardiovascular events. Both groups will be followed up
      within 1year after PCI.

      Summary：The multicentre randomized trial(RESCIND-3) will provide new evidence of the
      effectiveness of mHealth tools on improving 12-month drug compliance following PCI among
      patients with AMI.

    <description>The control group will receive a simplified tool including only the education message. The methodology will ensure that potential confounders by differences in nonspecific support and attention could be adjusted. Regular messages about prevention and cure of CHD will be sent to both groups four times a week. The short texts will be selected from the guidelines in China to avoid misinformation. There are also some pictures or videos that help patients change their behavior. Patients will be followed up for 4/8/12 months after admission through mHealth tools or telephone.</description>

    <description>The internet-based counselling is the key module of social media in the intervention group. The consultation content mainly includes the feedback of coronary heart disease secondary prevention drug compliance, the feedback of risk factor level control, the feedback of life and behaviour habits, the feedback of adverse events, the feedback of health education knowledge improvement, the reminders of data upload, behaviour change, and health education learning.
When the patient has questions or discomfort during the medication, they can consult the applet and the applet will perform internet-based answers on the large database built by cardiologists. Meanwhile, social media will upload the question of consultation and report to the doctor according to individual differences in disease. If the patient is not satisfied with the auto-response, the patient can further consult his doctor and the doctor's response will be collected to improve the auto-response database</description>
