      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the enhanced PriCARE intervention in
      improving parenting capacity, decreasing child behavior problems, and reducing risk of child
      maltreatment at 4 primary care clinics in Philadelphia and 2 primary care clinics in North
      Carolina.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child behavioral concerns are common among families served by Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia (CHOP) and University of North Carolina (UNC) pediatric primary care centers. To
      address this, Child Adult Relationship Enhancement in Pediatric Primary Care (PriCARE) was
      developed. PriCARE has been evaluated in primary care centers at CHOP and UNC with promising
      findings with regards to reductions in child behavioral problems. The PriCARE curriculum has
      now been enhanced with strategies to increase participant engagement, retention of skills,
      and attendance. Efficacy of this enhanced PriCARE curriculum has not yet been evaluated. Nor
      has the impact of the PriCARE intervention on child maltreatment risk been explored.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the enhanced PriCARE
      program to improve parenting capacity as measured by the Parenting Scale total score and 3
      sub-scales.

      The secondary objectives are to:

        1. Measure the impact of PriCARE on parent-reported child behavior problems as assessed by
           the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory intensity and problems scales.

        2. Measure the impact of PriCARE on the quality of the parent-child relationship as
           measured by the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding.

        3. Measure the impact of PriCARE on the risk of child maltreatment as measured by the Child
           Abuse Potential Inventory.

        4. Identify and describe predictors of attendance in PriCARE groups.

        5. Identify and describe modifiers of the efficacy of PriCARE including but not limited to
           caregiver and child demographics.

        6. Assess caregivers' perceptions of the efficacy of PriCARE on improving parenting skills
           and child behavior as measured by the Therapeutic Attitude Inventory (TAI).

        7. Develop and pilot a new PriCARE Positive Discipline Module.

        8. Collect pilot data on added benefit of completing the PriCARE Positive Discipline
           Module.

      The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of
      the enhanced PriCARE on objectives listed above among 2- to 6-year-old children and their
      parents at four CHOP urban Primary Care Centers and two University of North Carolina primary
      care sites. The investigators intend to randomize up to 110 child-caregiver pairs (220
      subjects) to receive PriCARE immediately plus usual treatment (intervention group) and up to
      110 child-parent pairs (220 subjects) to receive PriCARE at a later time plus usual treatment
      (control group) for a total of up to 220 child-caregiver pairs (440 subjects). All
      child-caregivers pairs randomized to the control group will be placed on a waitlist and
      offered PriCARE after completion of data collection. Child maltreatment risk, parenting
      attitudes and skills, child behavior, and quality of the child-caregiver relationship will be
      measured at baseline (time 1) and approximately 8-17 weeks after randomization (time 2) for
      both the intervention and control groups. The follow up interview will also include a brief
      satisfaction questionnaire for participants randomized to the intervention group. For the
      subgroup of participants who complete the Positive Discipline Module, these measurements will
      be repeated approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of the Positive Discipline intervention
      (time 3).

    <measure>Change in the Parenting Scale (PS) score from time 1 to time 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (time 1), 8-17 weeks (time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the enhanced PriCARE program to improve parenting capacity as measured by the Parenting Scale (PS), a 30-item questionnaire that assesses dysfunctional parenting discipline strategies. Participants respond to various hypothetical situations with a 7-point Likert scale, where 7 is the &quot;ineffective&quot; end of the scale and a lower overall score indicates more effective parenting. There are 3 scale factors: 1) laxness, 2) over-reactivity, and 3) verbosity. Some items are unrelated to any of these 3 factors. The 11 Laxness items relate to permissive discipline, lack of rule reinforcement and providing positive consequences for misbehaviors. The 10 Over-Reactivity items reflect anger, irritability or meanness. The 7 Verbosity items suggest longer verbal responses such as talking when talking is ineffective. All item responses are averaged to compute the total score. Each factors' items are averaged to compute the factor scores</description>

    <measure>Change in the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) score from time 1 to time 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (time 1), 8-17 weeks (time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess the efficacy of the enhanced PriCARE on decreasing caregiver-reported child behavior problems as measured by the ECBI. The ECBI is a parent rating scale designed to measure conduct problem behaviors in children ages 2-16 years old. The instrument contains 36 items that assess behavior on two scales. The problem scale provides a yes/no problem identification rating for each item, and the sum of yes responses yields a problem score with a potential range from 0 to 36 with a clinical cutoff of 15. The intensity scale provides a frequency-of-occurrence rating for each item, ranging from never (1) to always (7) and the ratings are summed to yield an intensity score with a potential range from 36 to 252 with a clinical cutoff of 131. Higher scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding (DPICS) score from time 1 to time 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (time 1), 8-17 weeks (time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess the efficacy of enhanced PriCARE on impacting the quality of the caregiver-child relationship with the DPICS. Each dyad is observed in 3 standard situations that involve varying levels of parental control and display dyadic interactions targeted by PriCARE: child-led play, caregiver-led play, clean-up. The coding manual has definitions, examples, and guidelines for deciding how to code the 24 standard caregiver and child behaviors. The interactions are video-recorded and coded by a blinded research assistant. Zero, or not observed, is the minimum for all behaviors. The total score is the sum of the coded behaviors within each category, thus there is no set maximum. A second research assistant re-codes 25% of randomly selected videos to check for coding reliability. Reliability will be assessed using % agreement, intraclass correlations, and Cohen's kappa. Comparing pre- and post-intervention videos will demonstrate caregiver and child behavior changes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (time 1), 8-17 weeks (time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>CAPI change scores from time 1 to time 2 will be measured. CAPI, a 160-item survey, measures traits &amp; parenting styles typical of known physical child abusers. Each item has a weighted value based on if agree vs. disagree is chosen and then the values are summed. Child physical abuse scores range from 0-486 with higher scores indicating caregiver has traits similar to those of known child abusers and has a higher risk of abuse. Ranges for factor scales are: distress (0-261), rigidity (0-64), unhappiness (0-69), problems with child and self (0-30), problems with family (0-38), problems with others (0-24) Higher factor scores imply higher symptom levels. Three validity scales and ranges are: lie (0-18), random (0-18), inconsistency (0-20). Ego-strength score ranges from 0-40 with higher score indicating more emotional stability. Loneliness score ranges from 0-15; higher score means more isolation.</description>

    <measure>Therapeutic Attitudes Inventory (TAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-17 weeks (time 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess caregivers' perceptions of the efficacy of PriCARE on improving parenting skills and child behavior as measured by the TAI. The TAI is a brief 10-question satisfaction measure of parent training and parent-child treatments. Questions are answered on a 5-point Likert scale with 1 indicating the lowest (&quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;much worse than before&quot;, &quot;much less confident&quot;, etc.) and 5 indicating the highest (&quot;very many useful techniques&quot;, &quot;very much better than before&quot;, &quot;more confident&quot;, etc.). Responses are added together and greater TAI total scores indicate greater levels of participant satisfaction. The potential scores range from 10-50.</description>

    <description>PriCARE is a group caregiver training program located in the primary care setting designed to improve child behaviors, caregiver-child relationships, parenting capacity, and reduce caregiver stress. PriCARE uses the 3 P skills (Praise, Paraphrase and Point-out-Behavior). The training starts with skills focused on giving attention to children's positive, pro-social behaviors, while ignoring minor misbehaviors. The second part of the training teaches techniques for giving effective commands in order to set age-appropriate limits and increase compliance to commands. PriCARE includes a stress education section that contextualizes the use of these skills with the types of behaviors and problems exhibited by many children living with psychosocial adversity and familial stress. Caregivers are encouraged to practice the skills with their child in between sessions. Since PriCARE's initial and successful pilot, the intervention has been enhanced in order to increase engagement and effectiveness.</description>
