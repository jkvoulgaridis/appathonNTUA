  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a biologically optimized infusion schedule of
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel works in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Altering the timing of the nab-paclitaxel infusion may improve response in
      patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To report overall response rate (ORR) for the optimized schedule according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report toxicity of the infusion schedule. II. To report disease control rate. III. To
      calculate relative dose intensity. IV. To report the overall survival (OS). V. To report
      progression free survival (PFS). VI. To correlate exploratory biomarkers with clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 3 and 17. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma to receive optimized infusion schedule of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. The ORR will be calculated as the proportion of patients who achieve a response to therapy divided by the total number of evaluable patients. All evaluable patients will be included in calculating the ORR for the study along with corresponding 95% binomial confidence intervals (CIs) (assuming that the number of patients who respond is binomially distributed).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 of optimized infusion schedule of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Frequency and severity of AEs and tolerability of the regimen will be collected and summarized by descriptive statistics. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. All patients who have received at least one dose of the therapeutic agents will be evaluable for toxicity and tolerability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate is calculated as the proportion of patients who achieve a response and stable disease to therapy divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Disease control rate will be calculated along with corresponding 95% binomial CIs (assuming that the number of patients who respond is binomially distributed).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative dose intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Relative dose intensity is calculated as the ratio of &quot;delivered&quot; to the &quot;planned&quot; dose over the period of therapy and will be summarized using descriptive statistics.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of therapy to documented progression or death without progression, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of
             the pancreas. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be
             made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the clinical and
             radiographic data. Participants with islet cell neoplasms are excluded

          -  Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable by computed tomography (CT) scan
             (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], if patient is allergic to CT contrast media or
             if the tumor is difficult to delineate on CT scan) as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria

          -  Non-pregnant and non-lactating

               -  If a female patient is of child-bearing potential, as evidenced by regular
                  menstrual periods, she must have a negative serum pregnancy test beta-human
                  chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) documented 72 hours prior to the first
                  administration of study drug

               -  The patient must agree to use a method of contraception considered highly
                  effective by the investigator during the period of administration of study drug
                  and after the end of treatment for an additional 3 months. Adequate birth control
                  methods are defined below

                    -  Women will be considered of childbearing potential unless surgically
                       sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or if
                       they are post-menopausal (defined as absence of menses for at least 1 year).
                       Sexually active men and women of childbearing potential who are sexually
                       active and not willing to use a highly effective method of birth control
                       during the trial and for at least three months after will be considered
                       ineligible for the trial. A highly effective method of birth control is
                       defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per
                       year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables,
                       combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual
                       abstinence or vasectomized partner. In the event that local regulations
                       require additional restrictions to the above definition, the patient
                       information will specify the acceptable contraceptive methods

          -  Patients must have received no previous chemotherapy or investigational therapy for
             the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Prior adjuvant treatment is allowed as

             or gemcitabine administered as a radiation sensitizer or in the adjuvant setting is
             allowed, provided at least 2 month have elapsed since completion of the last dose and
             no lingering significant toxicities are present. Prior radiation is allowed as long as
             the planned lesion(s) to be measured were not previously radiated

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L (obtained =&lt; 14 days prior to
             randomization)

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (100 x 10^9/L) (obtained =&lt; 14 days prior to

             normal range (ULN), unless liver metastases are clearly present, then =&lt; 5 x ULN is
             allowed (obtained =&lt; 14 days prior to randomization)

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 x ULN (obtained =&lt; 14 days prior to randomization)

          -  Patient has Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 60 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

          -  Patient has been informed about the nature of the study, has agreed to participate in
             the study, and signed the informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in any
             study-related activities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has known brain metastases, unless previously treated and well-controlled for
