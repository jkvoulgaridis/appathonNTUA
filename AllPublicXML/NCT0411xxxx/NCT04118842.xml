  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, 3 treatment period, fixed-sequence study in healthy
      non-Japanese male subjects, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive), performed at a single study
      centre. Treatment Period 1 will establish the single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      savolitinib. Dosing of daily rifampicin during Treatment Period 2 will result in maximal
      induction of the CYP450 enzymes including CYP3A4. Treatment Period 3 will then establish the
      single dose PK profile of savolitinib under maximum CYP450 induction conditions. Comparison
      of the PK profile of savolitinib between Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 3 will
      quantify the effect of CYP450 enzyme induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment starts with a single dose of savolitinib (Treatment Period 1), followed by a
      washout period at least of 14 days after savolitinib dosing and before the start of Treatment
      Period 2, followed by rifampicin administration for 5 days (Treatment Period 2), and lastly,
      a combination of savolitinib + rifampicin (Treatment Period 3). Overall, all subjects will
      receive 2 single doses of 600 mg savolitinib and 7 daily doses of 600 mg rifampicin. Subjects
      will be resident in the study centre when receiving study drug administrations (savolitinib
      [Treatment Period 1], rifampicin [Treatment Period 2] and savolitinib+rifampicin [Treatment
      Period 3]). Subjects are required to fast overnight before each dosing day. Rifampicin will
      be administered 1 hour before breakfast with 240 mL water. The subjects will need to complete
      high-fat, high calorie breakfast before administration of savolitinib in Treatment Period 1,
      Day 1 (Study Day 1) and Treatment Period 3 Day 1 (Study Day 20).

             grandparent (maternal or paternal) of Japanese ethnicity.

          2. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator (PI), may either put the volunteer at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to
             participate in the study.

          3. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion

        rate &lt; 45 or &gt; 85 beats per minute. 9 Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm,
        conduction or morphology of the 12 lead resting ECG that may interfere with the
        interpretation of QTc interval changes. These include healthy subjects with any of the
        following:

          1. Abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead (V2)
             or left ventricular hypertrophy.

          2. PR interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there is no
             evidence of ventricular pre-excitation).

             syndrome, or family history of unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
             first-degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

        before the first administration of the IMP or longer (5 times the half-life) if the
        medication has a long half-life. No medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval and
        cause TdP are allowed.

        subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e.,
        during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the
        interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures,
        restrictions, and requirements.
