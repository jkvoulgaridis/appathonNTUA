  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of implementing a group-based integrated
      early child development intervention through the government health system in one sub-district
      of Bangladesh, and to assess the resulting uptake of the intervention in the target
      population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RINEW intervention is a group-based integrated nutrition, responsive stimulation, and
      WASH intervention with a goal to improve child development outcomes. The intervention is
      delivered in group sessions to pregnant women and mothers or primary caregivers of children
      under 24 months of age. The RINEW intervention was tested in a pilot cluster-randomized
      control study in Bangladesh, where the investigators found the intervention group had better
      self-reported knowledge and behavior related to early child development. The investigators
      aim to implement this intervention through the government health system in one sub-district
      of Bangladesh, and assess the feasibility of delivering the intervention in this way, as well
      as the uptake of the intervention in the target population. The facilitators will be trained
      by the study team, and the intervention will be implemented in community-level health
      centers, facilitated by government health workers.

      The specific objectives of this work are to:

        1. Assess the feasibility (i.e. satisfaction of providers, perceived appropriateness of
           content and practicability of session delivery, population demand for sessions, quality
           and frequency of implementation, and preparedness of health system) of implementing the
           RINEW intervention through the government health system

        2. Identify barriers, facilitators/opportunities, and pathway for scale up of the RINEW
           intervention through government health system

        3. Assess the coverage of the intervention in the target population

        4. Assess the uptake of recommended behaviors in the target population

      To reach these objectives the investigators will

        1. Train government health workers to deliver the intervention at government health
           facilities

        2. Conduct a clinic-based process evaluation using both quantitative and qualitative
           methods at multiple time points during the 12-months intervention

        3. Conduct population-based quantitative baseline and endline assessments to assess
           intervention coverage and uptake

    <measure>Change in caregiver early child development knowledge and practices</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months after intervention; ~15 min/assessment</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of the Family Care Indicators (FCI), including self-reported behaviors and knowledge and observations during the interview, will be used to measure childhood development knowledge and practices. The FCI has the following sub-scales: 1) household books (number); 2) magazines or newspapers in the household (number), 3) sources of play materials (number of 3 possible categories), 4) varieties of play materials (number of 7 possible categories), 5) play activities (number of 6 possible categories). The scores from each sub-scale are summed to calculate the total score. For all sub-scales and the total score, higher scores are associated with a better child care. Investigators will also assess 11 additional observational items including observations of the home environment, and parental responsiveness and acceptance during the interview. Positive responses are summed to create an observation score.</description>

Number of days experiencing each symptom in the last week is converted into a score: 0= 0 or less than 1 day; 1= 1-2 days; 2= 3-4 days, 3=5-7 days, and the total score is a sum of negative symptoms experienced (positive items are reverse scored). The score ranges from 0-60, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms experienced.</description>

    <description>These group sessions will be delivered by government health workers, and include behavioral recommendations about responsive stimulation, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, lead poisoning prevention, and maternal mental health. Pregnancy groups and caregiver-child groups will be held separately, and mothers and caregivers who attend sessions will receive simple toys and books to use during some of the intervention sessions, which they will be permitted to take home with them. In addition, mothers and caregivers who attend intervention sessions will receive 30 sachets containing 1 gm multiple micronutrient powder (MNP) per month. Beginning as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, health workers will facilitate pregnant women in receiving the Iron and Folic acid supplements already provided by the Government of Bangladesh and will continue the supplementation up to three months post-partum period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Integrated child stimulation, nutrition, lead, arsenic, WASH intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The content of the intervention curriculum was developed considering the needs of the specific ages of the children attending the group, as well as the feasibility of delivering the package in the community. The pregnancy module encompasses information on significance of prenatal care for child development, physiological symptoms and solutions, maternal diet, education on kangaroo mother care (KMC), breast feeding, thinking healthy, hygiene, and lead and arsenic prevention. The curriculum for lactating mothers focuses on specialized messages for 4 age groups of children: 0-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-18 months and 19-24 months. The overall package includes information regarding WASH, psychosocial stimulation, nutrition, maternal mental health, lead and arsenic. As research evidence showed that psychosocial stimulation provided for 10 or 12 months can significantly improve child development, the psychosocial stimulation component is included in every fortnightly session.</description>
