  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long bone defect (LBD) is defined as a focalized loss of bone tissue in any long bone of the
      upper or lower extremity. Long bone defects are a complex problem, that may arise as a
      complication of many different pathologies, such as trauma, tumors or infection. Whereas
      post-traumatic defects are the largest group.

      Reports estimate that there are almost 4 million bone grafting procedures worldwide per year.
      However, limb reconstruction in the context of a bony defect is challenging and up to date
      there is little evidence and treatment recommendations.

      In a multi-national approach, the aim of this project is to set up an international,
      multicenter registry to gather information and details on prevalence or incidence, current
      treatments, complications and outcome.

      The purpose of this project is to set up an international, multicenter registry of patient
      presenting with defects in long bones. Up to date, treatment remains challenging with little
      evidenced-based recommendations.

      For this purpose, any patient who presents at a study center with a bone defect of the
      defined expansion of any long bone is eligible for inclusion. Over a 3-year period as many
      patients as possible are included from the participating sites, at least 600 patients should
      be included in the registry. Details on any surgical intervention that is used to treat a
      bone defect will be recorded. Further patient-related and other pre-defined outcome measures
      will be collected.

      There is no formal hypothesis to this registry, hence it will help to identify prevalence and
      underlying etiologies, evaluate treatment strategies, and highlight possible challenges and
      complications - and will so help to gather clinical evidence to provide better treatment for
      patients suffering from a long bone defect.

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
Physical function: This item measures self-reported capability rather than actual performance. It includes the functioning of lower extremities (walking or mobility) as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands. We will use the short form 10b.
Physical function, upper extremity: This item measures activities that require use of the upper extremity including shoulder, arm, and hand activities. Examples include writing, using buttons, or opening containers. We will use the short form 7.
Pain Interference: This item assesses self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. We will use the short form 8a.
Short forms will be used in all sites possible (i.e. where the translation is available).</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-3L assessment (Five items, 3-point categorical scale) The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.
o The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>
