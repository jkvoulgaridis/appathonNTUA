      This is an observational study that gives baseline and follow-up information, that does not
      directly influence the allocation of patients to various treatment Options (conservative and

    <description>Change in the symptom scores assessed by the German Pelvic Floor Questionnaire (GPFQ) by at least 1.0 points 6 months post-therapy.
The GPFQ does contain the domains bladder function, bowel function, prolapse and sexual symptoms. In each domain a total of 10 points may be reached. The maximum symptom score for the entire questionnaire are 40 points. The minimal symptom score is 0 points. The minimal important difference (MID) for patients with Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) is 1.0 points. A decrease of the symptom score by at least 1 point reflects a meaningful improvement.</description>
