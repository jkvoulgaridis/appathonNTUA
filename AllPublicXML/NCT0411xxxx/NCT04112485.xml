    <textblock>
      60 patients involved were divided into two matched groups; Group A: 30 patients were treated
      with conventional fenestration laminectomy and discectomy and Group B: 30 patients were
      treated with microdiscectomy. The age of the patients involved in this study ranged from 19
      years old to 46 years old

      60 patients involved were divided into two matched groups; Group A: 30 patients were treated
      with conventional fenestration laminectomy and discectomy and Group B: 30 patients were
      treated with microdiscectomy. The age of the patients involved in this study ranged from 19
      years old to 46 years old. All the patient was suffering from symptomatic lumbar disc
      herniation L4-5. Each patient was assessed clinically and MRI was done for all the patients
      to prove clinically, the symptomatic lumbar disc herniation which was present in all
      patients.
