    <textblock>
      Female suicide attempts occur more often in the weeks before and after menses onset, and have
      been linked to ovarian hormone withdrawal. The proposed project will use a two-week
      intervention to stabilize hormones in females with recent suicidal thoughts; this paradigm is
      a safe way to learn how cyclical changes in hormones and their metabolites influence
      short-term risk of suicide. The data acquired will contribute to our understanding of the
      biology of acute suicide risk and advance efforts to develop safe and effective treatments
      that eliminate predictable monthly worsening of suicide risk in reproductive-age females.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the second leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, and female
      suicide attempts occur most frequently around menses (perimenstrually), when estradiol (E2)
      and progesterone (P4) fall rapidly. A recent prospective study demonstrated that suicidal
      ideation (SI) and attempts peak perimenstrually in natural cycles, and that this
      perimenstrual worsening of SI can be prevented by administering stabilizing doses of E2+P4
      (relative to placebo). Therefore, while E2+P4 withdrawal is a viable model of proximal
      suicide risk in females with SI, mechanisms are unclear. GABAergic neuroactive steroid
      metabolites of ovarian hormones (e.g., allopregnanolone), exert potent sedative and
      antidepressant effects; we hypothesize that acute perimenstrual withdrawal from these hormone
      metabolites may increase suicide risk by increasing hyperarousal and hopelessness. The
      long-term objectives of this research are to (1) use the menstrual cycle as a model to probe
      the proximal mechanisms of suicide, and (2) develop long-term treatments that eliminate
      hormonal contributions to suicide. The objective of the current work is to use a crossover
      placebo-controlled trial of E2+P4 stabilization (vs. natural E2+P4 withdrawal under placebo)
      in the perimenstrual weeks to probe behavioral (hopelessness, hyperarousal) and
      molecular/genetic (neuroactive steroid levels, mRNA expression for enzymes critical for
      synthesizing neuroactive steroids) mediators of perimenstrual suicide risk. Design: In this
      mechanistic trial, 90 female outpatients with past-month SI will complete two counterbalanced
      conditions: (1) two weeks of placebo during natural perimenstrual E2+P4 withdrawal, and (2)
      two weeks of perimenstrual E2+P4 stabilization (.1mg/day transdermal estradiol + 200mg/day
      oral micronized progesterone) to prevent withdrawal. Five labs per condition will capture
      changes in gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) quantified neuroactive steroids,
      messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression for enzymes critical for synthesizing
      neuroactive steroids, and physiological arousal. Our app (BiAffect) will collect ecological
      momentary assessments (EMA; 4x/day) of behavioral constructs and SI, and will passively track
      arousal via movement and typing speed instability. Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to evaluate
      hyperarousal and hopelessness as interacting mechanisms by which perimenstrual E2+P4
      withdrawal (vs. experimental E2+P4 stabilization) increases proximal suicide risk. Aim 2 is
      to evaluate neuroactive steroid withdrawal as a mechanism by which perimenstrual E2+P4
      withdrawal (vs. stabilization) increases proximal suicide risk. If appropriate, a multilevel
      path model will test a path in which E2+P4 withdrawal (vs. stabilization) causes neuroactive
      steroid withdrawal, which increases in hopelessness and hyperarousal, which in turn increases
      proximal suicide risk. Relevance. By conducting a mechanistic experiment to probe the
      mediators of a known cause of proximal suicide risk, the proposed research responds to public
      calls from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored Suicide Research
      Prioritization Agenda to identify modifiable causes of proximal suicide risk.

    <measure>Perimenstrual Change in Daily Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean daily rating in the perimenstrual phase (days +12 to +17 following a positive luteinizing hormone surge in urine on day=0) minus the mean daily rating in the midluteal phase (days +0 to +5)</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ) is a 25-item self-report questionnaire assessing suicidality. Each day, individuals rate each of 25 items on a scale from 1 (Not at All) to 6 (Extreme). Mean scores are computed, providing a single number for each day that represents the participant's mean suicidal ideation (1 to 6), with higher daily values representing more severe suicidal ideation.
Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in each condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (days +12 to +17 following a positive luteinizing hormone surge in urine on day=0) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (days +0 to +5). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in suicidal ideation, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale is an interview designed to assess various aspects of suicide risk. In the present study, this questionnaire is administered daily via phone interview as part of a risk screening process. Here, we utilize a single dichotomous outcome from a single item representing suicidal planning from the C-SSRS interview: &quot;Today, have you thought about how or when you might kill yourself?&quot;. Each day, individuals chose either &quot;Yes&quot; (coded as 1) or &quot;No&quot; (coded as 0).
Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in each condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (days +12 to +17 following a positive luteinizing hormone surge in urine on day=0) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (days +0 to +5). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in suicidal planning, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <time_frame>Mean daily rating in the perimenstrual phase (days +12 to +17 following a positive luteinizing hormone surge in urine on day=0) minus the mean daily rating in the midluteal phase (days +0 to +5)</time_frame>
    <description>Hopelessness is assessed with a daily Beck Hopelessness Scale (short form), a 10-item self-report measure with true-false items that assess hopelessness and the extent of positive and negative beliefs about the future. Summed scores range from 0 to 10. Scores provide a measure of the severity of self-reported hopelessness, with higher scores representing greater hopelessness.
Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in each condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (days +12 to +17 following a positive luteinizing hormone surge in urine on day=0) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (days +0 to +5). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in hopelessness, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease.</description>

    <description>Agitation is assessed with a daily Brief Agitation Measure (BAM), a 3-item self-report measure in which participants rate their symptoms of agitation ranging from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 6 (Strongly Agree). Mean daily scores (ranging from 0 to 6) provide a measure of the severity of self-reported agitation, with higher scores representing greater agitation.
Perimenstrual change scores are calculated for each person in each condition as the mean of scores in the perimenstrual phase (days +12 to +17 following a positive luteinizing hormone surge in urine on day=0) minus the mean in the midluteal phase (days +0 to +5). Therefore, positive values represent a perimenstrual increase in agitation, and negative values represent a perimenstrual decrease.</description>
