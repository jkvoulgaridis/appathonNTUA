      This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2a, First-In-Human study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of EO2401 in patients with unequivocal evidence of
      progressive or first recurrent glioblastoma.

      EO2401 is an innovative cancer peptide therapeutic vaccine based on the homologies between
      Tumor Associated Antigens and microbiome-derived peptides that will be administered alone and
      in combination with nivolumab, and nivolumab/bevacizumab to generate preliminary safety and
      efficacy data in patients with progressive glioblastoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with unequivocal documented (including histological confirmation of
             Glioblastoma-GB- at the primary diagnosis) evidence of progressive or first recurrent
             GB on MRI, as defined by RANO criteria

          2. Patients with at least 1 measurable lesion

          3. Patients with an age ≥ 18 years old

          4. Patients who are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 positive

          5. Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 or
             Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          6. Patients should have received standard therapy, including surgery (biopsy, incomplete
             or complete resection), radiation, temozolomide, if applicable

               1. Radiation therapy must have been finished 28 days before first study treatment
                  administration

               2. Patients who received temozolomide as adjuvant therapy must have stopped the
                  treatment and have a wash-out period of 28 days before first study treatment
                  administration (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and 5 half lives for experimental
                  therapies)

               3. Patients with unmethylated methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter
                  can be included even if they have not received temozolomide prior to the
                  inclusion in this clinical study)

          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to dosing

          8. Considering the embryofetal toxicity of the nivolumab shown on animals' models, the
             following recommendations for contraception must be followed:

             a. If not surgically sterile, female patients of childbearing potential age must use
             highly effective barrier contraception from signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF)
             through 6 months after the last treatment dose administered. Highly effective barrier
             and non barrier contraception included: i. Combined (estrogen and progesterone
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral
             Intravaginal Transdermal ii. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation: Oral Injectable Implantable iii. Intrauterine device iv.
             Intrauterine hormone-releasing system v. Bilateral tubal occlusion vi. Sexual
             abstinence. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over 1 month between
             menstruations), confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended. This
             recommendation also applies to women of childbearing potential with infrequent or
             irregular menstrual cycles.

             b. If not surgically sterile, male with female partner of childbearing potential must
             use condom from signing the ICF through 8 months after the last treatment dose
             administered. Males must ensure that their partners of childbearing potential use
             highly effective barrier contraception also.

          9. Patients having received the information sheet and who have provided written informed
             consent prior to any study-related procedures

         10. Patients willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
