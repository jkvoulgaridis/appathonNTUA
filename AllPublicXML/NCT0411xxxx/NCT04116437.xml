    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of zanubrutinib (also known as
      BGB-3111) in participants with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
      lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, mantle cell lymphoma, or marginal zone
      lymphoma intolerant of prior ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib treatment, compared with their
      ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib intolerance adverse event profile as assessed by the
      recurrence and the change in severity of adverse events.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must meet protocol defined disease criteria requiring treatment for their
             respective disease prior to initiation of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib

          2. Ibrutininb and/or acalabrutinib intolerance defined as an unacceptable toxicity where,
             in the opinion of the investigator, treatment should be discontinued in spite of
             optimal supportive care as a result of one of the following:

               1. 1 or more Grade ≥2 non-hematological toxicities for &gt;7 days (with or without
                  treatment)

               2. 1 or more Grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity of any duration

               3. 1 or more Grade 3 neutropenia with infection or fever or

               4. Grade 4 heme toxicity which persists to the point that the investigator chose to
                  stop therapy due to toxicity NOT progression.

          3. Ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib-related toxicities must have resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or
             baseline prior to initiating treatment with zanubrutinib.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3 with or without growth factor support and
             platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm^3 (may be post-transfusion), on or prior to C1D1 of
             zanubrutinib

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including the following:

               1. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before the Screening

               2. Unstable angina within 3 months before the Screening

               3. New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure

               4. History of sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and/or

               5. QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula &gt; 480 milliseconds

               6. History of Mobitz II second-degree or third-degree heart block without a
                  permanent pacemaker in place

          2. History of central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage

          3. Documented progressive disease (PD) during ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib treatment.

          4. Have received any anticancer therapy (other than immunotherapy) for CLL/SLL, WM, MCL,
             and MZL &lt; 7 days before any Screening assessments are performed or any immunotherapy
             treatment, taken alone or as part of a chemoimmunotherapy regimen, &lt; 4 weeks before
             any Screening assessments are performed

          5. Requires ongoing need for corticosteroid treatment &gt; 10 mg daily of prednisone or
             equivalent corticosteroid. Note: Systemic corticosteroids must be fully tapered
