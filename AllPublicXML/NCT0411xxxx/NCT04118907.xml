  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this experiment, patients with chronic pure tone tinnitus were divided into three groups
      to receive auditory stimulation, somatosensory stimulation, vestibular stimulation and
      combined stimulation, in order to find an effective way to treat tinnitus

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      120 patients with chronic pure tone tinnitus over 6 months were randomly divided into 6
      groups, one group was given auditory stimulation, one group was given somatosensory
      stimulation, one group was given auditory stimulation + somatosensory stimulation, one group
      was given auditory stimulation + vestibular stimulation, the last group was given auditory
      stimulation + somatosensory stimulation + vestibular stimulation.

    <description>Tinnitus handicap inventory score was used to detect the degree of tinnitus.0-16 points without disability, 18-36 points with mild disability, 38-56 points with moderate disability and 58-100 points with severe disability. The 95% confidence interval is 20 points, that is, the difference between the two tests before and after the experiment is greater than or equal to 20 points.</description>

    <description>The patients were recruited to record their medical history, and the hearing level, tinnitus indicators, vestibular function and tinnitus disability indicators were tested. Then the patients were randomly divided into six groups. They received the corresponding stimulation 20 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. After the last stimulation, the above tests were repeated immediately, one week later and three months later.</description>
