  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label, long term extension study evaluating the
      safety of ecopipam tablets for the treatment of pediatric subjects (aged ≥6 to ≤18 years at
      Baseline) with Tourette Syndrome. Subjects who completed the Phase 2b, randomized,
      double-blind, efficacy and safety study (EBS-101-CL-001) without major reportable protocol
      deviations, and who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study will be eligible
      to participate in this study. All subjects who provide informed consent and participate in
      this study will be titrated to a target dose of 2 mg/kg/day. All participants rolling over
      from the Phase 2b double-blind efficacy and safety study will be tapered off of study
      medication to maintain the blind from that study. Subjects will complete study visits every
      month for 1 year. Follow Up visits will be conducted 7 and 14 days after the last dose of
      study medication and a Follow Up phone call will be conducted 30 days after the last dose of
      study medication.

All adverse events that occur after the first study medication application and up to 30 days after the subject's last study medication application will be considered treatment emergent adverse events.</description>
