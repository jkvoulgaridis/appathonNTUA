  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common pediatric surgical procedures. The
      management of postoperative pain and agitation after AT is still a controversial issue.
      Safety considerations limit the use of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      leading to inadequate control of the high levels of postoperative pain experienced by AT
      patients. Along with pain killers, non-pharmacological strategies have remarkable impact on
      pain management in children. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet in
      2015 on adult patients suggest that auditory stimulation with music in the perioperative
      setting, and even when patients are under general anaesthesia, can reduce postoperative pain,
      anxiety, and analgesia needs. The authors concluded that there is sufficient evidence to
      implement auditory stimulation in the treatment of all adult surgical patients, regardless of
      the mode of administration. Up to now, no research has investigated the effects of
      intraoperative auditory stimulation on pain and agitation upon awakening after AT in the
      pediatric population. Objective of this study is to determine the effects of intraoperative
      auditory stimulation on pain and agitation upon awakening after pediatric AT.

    <measure>Pain score (Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale), self-administered (collaborative children between 3 and 8 years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after awakening</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score for collaborative children between 3 and 8 years will be evaluated with the self-administered Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating scale, ranged 0-10.
Higher scores correspond to higher levels of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score (Visual Analogue Scale), self-administered (collaborative children &gt;=8 years) or administered by parents (non-collaborative children &gt;=8 years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after awakening</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score for &gt;=8 years old children will be evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale (self administered if collaborative; administered by parents if non-collaborative children), ranged 0-10.
Higher scores correspond to higher levels of pain.
In accordance with previous studies (Ferreira-Valente et al. Validity of four pain intensity rating scales. Pain 2011;152:2399-2404), the scores of Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating scale and Visual Analogue Scale will be considered comparable and combined in one outcome variable.</description>

    <measure>Pain score (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale), evaluated by parents (for children &lt;=3 years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after awakening</time_frame>
    <description>For children &lt;=3 years, pain score will be evaluated by parents using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale, ranged 0-10.
Higher scores correspond to higher levels of pain.</description>

    <measure>Pain score (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain scale), evaluated by parents (for non-collaborative children between 3 and 7 years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after awakening</time_frame>
    <description>For non-collaborative children between 3 and 7 years, pain score will be evaluated by parents using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain (CHEOPS) scale, ranged 0-10.
Higher scores correspond to higher levels of pain.
In accordance with previous studies, the scores of the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale and of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain (CHEOPS) scale will be considered comparable and combined in one outcome variable.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after awakening</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using the Paediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, ranging form 0 to 20. Higher scores correspond to higher levels of agitation.</description>
