  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the generally poor prognosis, with no chance of long-term survival, health related
      quality of life is a very important objective in the treatment of patients with pancreatic
      cancer. This non-interventional study (NIS) is specifically desinged to evlaute the
      health-related quality of life in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving first
      line gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel. Furthermore important treatment objectives such as response
      rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival as well as safety and tolerability
      should be analyzed in a daily routine setting.
