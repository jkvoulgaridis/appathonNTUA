  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications after surgery. Patients
      undergoing orthognathic surgery are reported to have a high rate of PONV, especially those
      undergoing bimaxillary surgery. Activation of cholinergic system plays an important role in
      the development of PONV. Penehyclidine is an muscarinic antagonists which selectively block
      M1 and M3 receptors and is commonly used to decrease oral secretion. The purpose of this
      retrospective cohort study is to investigate whether use of penehyclidine is associated with
      a reduced risk of PONV in patients undergoing bimaxillary surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are one of the most frequent complications after
      surgery, and are associated with patients' dissatisfaction after anesthesia and surgery.
      Orthognathic surgery is widely performed for the correction of dentofacial deformities. PONV
      is common after orthognathic surgery. Despite of improved anti-emetic prophylaxis, patients
      undergoing orthognathic surgery are reported to have a high incidence of PONV, especially
      those after bimaxillary surgery.

      It is known that activation of central cholinergic system plays an important role in the
      development of PONV. Muscarinic antagonists such as scopolamine can block muscarinic
      receptors in the cerebral cortex and produce anti-emetic effects. Penehyclidine is a new
      muscarinic antagonists which selectively block M1 and M3 receptors. It has fewer adverse
      effects compared with other anticholinergics. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study
      is to investigate whether use of penehyclidine is associated with a reduce risk of PONV in
      patients undergoing bimaxillary surgery.

    <measure>Postoperative agitation after bimaxillary surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8:00 am on the first day after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative agitation was diagnosed when a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (scale ranges from -5 to +4, with higher scale indicating severe agitation) reached +2 or more at any time within 2 hours after extubation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain after bimaxillary surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain was assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale (an 11-point scale where 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain). A score of 4 or more is defined a moderate-to-severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative complications during hospital stay after surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative complications were generally defined as new-onset medical events that were harmful for patients' recovery and required therapeutic intervention.</description>
