      Aim of the study: to identify the signs of acute appendicitis delta signs - clinical,
      laboratory or ultrasound signs, whose change (delta) would allow to identify or deny the
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis without a computed tomography examination and thus to lower
      computed tomography rates.

      This study consists of two parts:

        -  In the first part investigators enroll all patients (except pregnant) that are refered
           to Vilnius University Hospital Santaros clinics with suspected acute appendicitis in
           order to get cohort data. All patient get primary clinical evaluation, laboratory tests
           (WBC, CRP) an ultrasound examination.

        -  After primary evaluation if final diagnosis could not be made, and investigator still
           suspect acute appendicitis, participant is included in to randomised study part.

        -  Randomised sudy part has two arms: control and observation groups.

        -  Control group get the traditional diagnostic path - is refered to CT scan examination.

        -  Observation group get repeated evaluation after 8-12 hours and only than is diagnosis
           stays unclear, patient gets a CT scan.

        -  All patient are contacted after 30 days after visit to our hospital, to get information
           about their health status and possible additional visits to other hospitals or
           operations.

    <description>when performing alternative diagnostic protocol, that includes patient observation for short period we expect to reduce a number of CT scans performed, for the patients with suspected acute appendicitis.</description>

    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Delta marker Alvarado acute appendicitis risk evaluation score Tha changes in score over the time that might show higher or lower probability of possible acute appendicitis. Scale ranges decribe a prediction of having acute appendicitis: 1-4 33 % of having appendicitis, 5-6 66 % of hanving, 7-10 93 % of having appendicitis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delta marker changes in ultrasound results</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in ultrasound findings over the time may progress and influence investigator to change opinion about the concusion. Repeated ultrasound diagnosis might change from unequivocal to acute apendicitis (and CT scan can be avoided then). We do use structured conclusions of the ultrasound exam, that might be: accute appendicitis; apendix visualised but changes are equivocal; apendix visualised uninflamed; apendix not visualised, but there are secondary findings; apendix not visualised and there is no secondary findings. We are going to measure the change in final ultrasound diagnosis over the time.</description>

    <measure>'Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) Score'</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>'Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) Score') evaluates the risk for acute appendicitis. scale ranges are: 0-4 low probability outpatient follow up, 5-8 inermediate probability in hospital observation, 9-12 high probability, surgical treatment..</description>
