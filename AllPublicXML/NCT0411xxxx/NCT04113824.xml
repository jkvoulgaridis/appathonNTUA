      Motion Style Acupuncture Treatment(MSAT) is a therapeutic technique using acupuncture needle
      created in Jaseng Hospital. This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain to
      move the part of their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians'
      observation. This treatment is known to relieve the pain and increase the range of
      motion(ROM). However, there has been no specific value for the effect of this treatment.

      So, we conducted a randomized controlled trials to verify the efficacy and safety of
      trapezuis MSAT. From July 2019 to September 2019, we collected 100 inpatients who were
      suffered from posterior nick pain with the numeric rating scale(NRS) over 4 after whiplash
      injury by acute traffic accident(TA). For experimental group(n=50), we conducted MSAT three
      times(on 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of hospitalization) and other Korean medical treatment. For
      control group(n=50), just Korean medical treatment except MSAT was conducted. For these two
      groups, we compared NRS, Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Range Of Motion(ROM), Nthe amount of
      pain via NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), VAS(Visual Analogue Scale), ROM(Range Of Motion), Neck
      Disability Index (NDI), and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D).

    <time_frame>day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of posterior neck pain and discomfort was assessed using NRS. NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10. The participant is asked to report their posterior neck pain and discomfort using NRS, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>

    <description>VAS is an assessment index in which the patient records their pain on a 100mm line from 'no pain' at one end, and 'the most severe pain imaginable' at the other end.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a method of indirectly calculating the weights of certain health states for quality of life after a multidimensional investigation of health states, and is the most widely used instrument for this purpose. The EQ-5D consists of 5 questions about current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression), and each question is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 3=moderate problems, 5=severe problems). In this study, we will use the Korean version of the EQ-5D, which has been demonstrated to be valid.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is an index that assesses improvements in functional limitation caused by whiplash injury. Participants rate the improvement in functional limitations after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Very much improved, 4=No change, 7=Very much worse). This index was originally developed for use in Psychology, but is currently used in various other medical fields to assess improvements in pain.</description>
