  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to a properly powered randomized controlled study, evaluating efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness of ICBT, we will conduct a pilot study to investigate if the trial design
      is feasible, if therapist-guided and self-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral
      therapy (ICBT) is acceptable for adolescents with depression and to provide preliminary
      clinical efficacy data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-blind parallel-group pilot randomised controlled feasibility trial with the overall
      aim to develop two internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy interventions,
      therapist-guided and self-guided, for adolescents with mild to moderate Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD) and their primary caregivers.

      Patients can be either referred or self-referred. All potential participants are initially
      screened via telephone. This is followed by a face-to-face inclusion assessment. Participants
      who are eligible and have consented will be randomized into one of three trial arms;
      therapist-guided ICBT, self-guided ICBT or TAU. In the experimental arms, participants, e.g.
      the adolescent and at least one caregiver, either receive 10 weeks of therapist-guided or
      self-guided internet-delivered behavioural activation (BA). In the control arm, participants
      receive treatment as usual within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) or
      primary care clinics. The primary endpoint will be at 3-month follow-up.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of the study design and trial
      procedures, including recruitment, withdrawal, drop out and attrition rates. The secondary
      objective is to (a) evaluate the acceptability of the ICBT interventions in regard to
      treatment satisfaction, credibility, reported adverse events, and program use, (b) to provide
      preliminary clinical efficacy data, and (c) to gather qualitative information on the
      experience of undergoing ICBT for depression from the perspective of adolescent patients,
      their caregivers and potential areas for improvement of future ICBT interventions.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Assessors conducting post- and follow-up assessments will be blind to treatment allocation, for the full duration of the trial. The outcome measures are identical for both groups, ensuring that the assessors remain blind. At each follow-up assessment, participants will be reminded by their assessor to not reveal their arm allocation. To measure blinding integrity, all assessors will record whether the participating families inadvertently reveal their group allocation, and subsequently guess each participant's treatment allocation at each assessment point and motivate their choice. The blinding will be broken after the trial's final participant has finished his/her 3-month follow-up assessment (primary endpoint). The trial will end when the trial's final participant has finished his/her 3-month follow-up assessment.</masking_description>

    <description>The BADS-S is designed to track changes in proposed mediators of behavioral activation, e.g. activation and avoidance. Total range is from 0-54 with higher values indicating higher degree of activation and lower degree of avoidance.
Changes during treatment in proposed mediators of behavioral activation on the BADS-S will be reported for the ICBT interventions.</description>

    <description>The TiC-P assess healthcare and societal resource use, including for example items on healthcare resource use, medications, school absenteeism, and parental productivity loss. In the present study no health economic evaluations will be conducted. Rather this instrument is included to gain feasibility data in preparation of a planned larger randomized controlled study. Therefore, no data on TiC-P will be reported in this trial.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Therapist-guided ICBT for depression</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive internet-delivered CBT with therapist support. The treatment consists of 8 online chapters with interactive features as videos and illustrations, delivered over a maximum of 10 weeks. The treatment has the main focus on behavioral activation.
The adolescent and the caregiver are provided with their own separate programs and login to the treatment platform. The parent program also consists of eight chapters, including psychoeducation about depression and how to support their adolescent in treatment.
The adolescents and caregivers have regular contact with a personal assigned therapist via written text messages in the platform. Participants are typically in contact with their therapist several times a week. The adolescent and caregiver can continue to access all treatment modules for the whole follow-up period (3 months), but without therapist-support.</description>

To ensure patient-safety, there will be clear instructions to the patients and primary caregivers how to get in contact with the study team in case of acute problems, and there will be clinical routines to detect and manage deterioration or suicidal tendencies.</description>
