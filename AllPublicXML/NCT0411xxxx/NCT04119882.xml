  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the performance characteristics of Apo J-Glyc as a
      novel biomarker for the early detection of myocardial ischaemia in patients with suspected
      acute coronary syndromes.

      This in vitro diagnosis clinical validation will test the Performance Characteristics of Apo
      J-Glyc measured with a novel in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test. Blood samples from eligible
      consenting subjects will be collected at hospital admission, throughout different post
      admission times (1h, 3h, 24h and 72h or discharge) as well as at follow-up (3, 6, 9 and 12
      months). The quantification of circulating Apo J-Glyc levels will be analysed in correlation
      with clinical data providing information about Apo J-Glyc as an ischaemia biomarker and its
      diagnostic and prognostic value.
