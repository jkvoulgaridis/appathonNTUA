  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease and typically
      affects the elderly. Clinically, BP is an intensely pruritic erythematous eruption with
      widespread blister formation. BP is usually a chronic disease, with spontaneous exacerbations
      and remissions, which may be accompanied by significant morbidity.

      BP usually requires on average a 1-year duration of treatment. Superpotent topical
      corticosteroids have been demonstrated to be effective. Despite their high efficacy, topical
      corticosteroids are often considered as poorly convenient, requiring the assistance of
      patients' relatives or a nurse to apply the topical treatment on a long period of time.

      Overall, whereas BP lesions can be adequately and rapidly controlled with either topical
      corticosteroids, there is a high need for a safe maintenance therapy to avoid treatment side
      effects due to cumulative doses of corticosteroids over months.

      Newer therapeutic agents such as ustekinumab targeting molecules involved in the inflammatory
      cascade associated with BP represent future alternatives to classical immunosuppressant drugs
      for maintenance therapy.
