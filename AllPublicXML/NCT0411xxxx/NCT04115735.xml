  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      His bundle pacing has been proposed as a superior alternative to standard right ventricular
      pacing. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether obtaining a His Bundle recording
      from the subclavian vein using a stylet driven pacemaker lead and commercially available
      sheath can be done in a quick and reliable manner. This would support the use of stylet
      driven leads for His bundle pacing.

      The purpose of this prospective observational study is to investigate whether obtaining a His
      Bundle recording from the subclavian vein using a stylet driven pacemaker lead and
      commercially available sheath can be done in a quick and reliable manner. Included in the
      study are patients undergoing permanent pacemaker implantation at Good Samaritan and Bethesda
      North Hospitals. The main outcome is successful recording of a His bundle potential.
      Secondary outcomes are the time necessary to record the His bundle and the measurement of the
      pacing threshold.

    <description>Threshold will be measured in volts at 1 millisecond and recorded for selective His bundle capture, non-selective His bundle capture, and ventricular septal capture as appropriate for each patient. The measurement of a normal His Bundle threshold is &lt; 2.0 V at 1.0 ms.</description>
