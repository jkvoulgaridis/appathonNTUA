  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) is the most common disorder of the adolescent hip
      and diagnosis and treatment of SCFE remain areas of controversy and investigation. The
      current issues relating to diagnosis stem from an inability to diagnose the condition early
      on, resulting in increased morbidity. Once diagnosed, there are multiple different options
      for surgical treatment, including in-situ pinning, and the Modified Dunn procedure. Research
      is ongoing to determine the parameters that should be considered when selecting a procedure
      to ensure an ideal outcome. In particular, there is a focus on investigating which treatment
      method may result in lower incidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head and
      femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), two significant long term concerns associated with SCFE.
      Despite myriad published studies on SCFE, very few are prospective and most lack sufficient
      patient numbers for clinically meaningful comparative analysis. The aim of this study is to
      develop a multi-center, international prospective registry of patients with SCFE to
      facilitate the comprehensive examination of clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes of
      each treatment, in relation to specific parameters determined prior to intervention. The
      general registry will serve as a hypothesis-generating database of prospectively collected
      outcomes. In turn, this will facilitate the development of targeted, hypothesis-testing
      randomized controlled trials and observational studies that can be housed within the larger
      registry.
