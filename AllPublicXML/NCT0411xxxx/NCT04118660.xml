      The purpose of the registry will be to support ongoing research in the etiology, early
      diagnosis, clinical management, and prognosis of lung cancer and other cancers and diseases
      of the thorax by developing a complete repository of specimens from patients with thoracic
      disease including but not limited to suspected lung cancer, mediastinal and pleural tumors
      and from patients at a very high risk of developing other thoracic cancers or other thoracic
      diseases.

      The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a Thoracic Specimen Registry at Mayo
      Clinic. The purpose of the registry will be to support ongoing research in the etiology,
      early diagnosis, clinical management, and prognosis of lung cancer and other cancers and
      diseases of the thorax by developing a complete repository of specimens from patients with
      thoracic disease including but not limited to suspected lung cancer, mediastinal and pleural
      tumors and from patients at a very high risk of developing other thoracic cancers or other
      thoracic diseases. Collected specimens will include peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage
      (BAL) fluid, pleural fluid, tissue (surgical resections &amp; biopsies) and touch prep samples.
      The specimens will be stored in a central location at Mayo Clinic and managed by the Mayo
      Clinic Thoracic Specimen Registry Steering Committee. The registry will be a foundation for
      the development and implementation of research protocols and clinical trials that will
      enhance current knowledge of etiology and detection, discovery of new molecular and
      biochemical markers for screening, early diagnosis, and develop state-of-the-art therapeutic
      and preventive interventions for managing patients with, or at risk for, thoracic cancers or
      other thoracic diseases.

      A blood sample will be collected at the time of consent/baseline. Optional subsequent blood
      draws maybe requested no more frequently than every 8 weeks. Patients scheduled for their
      clinically indicated thoracic procedure and have excess of clinical diagnostic tissue
      available will have tissue kept in the registry for future research. Patients scheduled for
      their clinical indicated bronchoscopy or CT guided procedure may have a sample go through the
      Touch Prep process and slides/cells will be kept for future research.

      Patients scheduled for clinically indicated bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage BAL or
      Thoracentesis (TAP) procedure as part of that procedure may have fluid that is in excess of
      clinical diagnostic material, saved of future research. In addition, at the time of any
      future clinically indicated blood draws, thoracic procedures, thoracic resections, or
      metastatic thoracic primary tumors resections from other organs tissue will be requested for
      the research study.
