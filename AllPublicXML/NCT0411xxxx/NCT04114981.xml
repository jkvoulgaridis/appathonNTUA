  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery works
      compared with fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with cancer that
      has spread to the brain from other parts of the body and has been removed by surgery. Single
      fraction stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single,
      high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue.
      Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery delivers multiple, smaller doses of radiation therapy
      over time. This study may help doctors find out if fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery is
      better or worse than the usual approach with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain if time to surgical bed failure is increased with fractionated stereotactic
      radiosurgery (FSRS) compared to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) in patients
      with resected brain metastasis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain if there is better emotional well-being at 9 months as assessed by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR) in patients with resected brain
      metastasis undergoing FSRS compared to SSRS (Primary quality of life [QOL] objective).

      II. To ascertain whether there is improved overall survival in patients with resected brain
      metastases who undergo FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS.

      III. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved
      overall QOL as assessed by the FACT-BR and Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) in patients
      who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).

      IV. To compare the functional independence in patients who receive FSRS to patients who
      receive SSRS.

      V. To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with
      the interventions, including the potential impact of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.

      VI. To compare rates of radiation necrosis at 12 months in patients who receive FSRS to
      patients who receive SSRS.

      VII. To evaluate if there is any difference in central nervous system (CNS) failure patterns
      (local, distant brain failure, local leptomeningeal disease, widespread leptomeningeal
      disease) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS after resection
      of brain metastasis.

      VIII. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is increased time
      to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who
      receive SSRS.

      IX. To determine in long-term survivors (patients who are alive more than 12 months from time
      of randomization) whether there is better emotional well-being and overall QOL as assessed by
      the FACT-BR and LASA in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients
      who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).

      X. To ascertain if time to surgical bed failure as assessed by central review is increased
      with FSRS compared to SSRS in patients with resected brain metastasis.

      XI. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved QOL as
      assessed by all other total and individual FACT-BR and LASA items and subscale values in
      patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Exploratory QOL objective).

      XII. To determine in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is less cognitive
      progression in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive
      SSRS (Exploratory cognitive objective).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo SSRS over 1 session.

      ARM II: Patients undergo FSRS over 3 or 5 daily sessions.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24
      months, then every 6 months until 5 years from randomization.

    <description>Surgical bed control is defined as the absence of new nodular contrast enhancement in the surgical bed. In other words, a surgical bed recurrence-free survival (SB-RFS) event is defined as radiographic evidence of a new contrast-enhancing lesion (specifically any new progressive enhancing nodularity) at the site of the surgical resection. Will use a stratified log-rank test that compares and will report the median SB-RFS times between the single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) arms while adjusting for the stratification factors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PRE-REGISTRATION:

          -  Pathology from the resected brain metastasis must be consistent with a non-central
             nervous system primary site. Patients with or without active disease outside the
             nervous system are eligible (including patients with unknown primaries), as long as
             the pathology from the brain is consistent with a non-central nervous system primary
             site.

          -  Three or fewer (i.e. 0 to 3) unresected brain metastases (as defined on the post
             operative magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) at the time of screening.

             o Note: Dural based metastases (e.g. commonly seen in breast cancer) are eligible.

          -  Unresected lesions must measure &lt; 4.0 cm in maximal extent on the contrasted
             post-operative treatment MRI brain scan. The unresected lesions will be treated with
             SRS as outlined in the treatment section of the concept.

             o Note: The metastases size restriction does not apply to the resected brain
             metastasis.

          -  One brain metastasis must be completely (gross total resection) resected =&lt; 30 days
             prior to pre-registration.

             o NOTE: May not have had resection of more than one brain metastasis.

          -  The resected brain metastasis must measure 2 cm or larger on the pre-operative MRI.

          -  Resection cavity must measure &lt; 5.0 cm in maximal extent and the resection must be
             complete (gross total resection) on the post-operative MRI obtained =&lt; 30 days prior
             to pre-registration.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 60.

          -  For women of childbearing potential only, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             done =&lt; 7 days prior to pre-registration is required.

               -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to employ adequate
                  contraception throughout the study and for men for up to 3 months after
                  completing treatment.

               -  A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not
                  undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally
                  postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any
                  time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  Ability to complete an MRI of the head with contrast.

          -  The brain metastasis must be located &gt; 5 mm of the optic chiasm and outside the brain
             stem.

          -  Must not have any prior whole brain radiation therapy.

          -  Past radiosurgery to other lesions is allowed.

             o NOTE: The surgically resected lesion cannot be the same location treated in the past
             with radiosurgery (i.e. repeat radiosurgery to the same location/lesion is not allowed
             on this protocol).

          -  May not have primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma.

          -  No evidence of leptomeningeal metastasis (LMD).

             o NOTE: For the purposes of exclusion, LMD is a clinical diagnosis, defined as
             positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology and/or equivocal radiologic or clinical
             evidence of leptomeningeal involvement. Patients with leptomeningeal symptoms in the
             setting of leptomeningeal enhancement by imaging (MRI) would be considered to have LMD
             even in the absence of positive CSF cytology, unless a parenchymal lesion can
             adequately explain the neurologic symptoms and/or signs. In contrast, an asymptomatic
             or minimally symptomatic patient with mild or nonspecific leptomeningeal enhancement
             (MRI) would not be considered to have LMD. In that patient, CSF sampling is not
             required to formally exclude LMD, but can be performed at the investigator's
             discretion based on level of clinical suspicion.

          -  Must be fluent in English, Spanish, or French.

        REGISTRATION:

        • Completion of all baseline electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) quality of life
        measures (or booklet quality of life measures) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
