  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis accounts for 15% of the causes of legal blindness. The etiological diagnosis of
      uveitis is difficult because of the poor bacteriological performance of aqueous or vitreous
      fluid analysis. At the end of a medical and paramedical check-up, oriented by the typology of
      uveitis, a clinical situation is frequently encountered: idiopathic uveitis with a
      Quantiferon test (QFN) positive orienting to an old or recent contact with tuberculosis.
      Ocular tuberculosis is often characterized by a partial and transient response to
      corticosteroid therapy (local or general), due to predominant hypersensitivity phenomena and
      low inoculum. Therefore, antitubercular treatment is recommended for idiopathic posterior
      uveitis with positive QFN. This treatment of 6-9 months has shown, in combination with
      systemic corticosteroids, its effectiveness on ocular inflammation and significant decrease
      in recurrence frequency.

      For previous uveitis with QFN positive, there is no study or recommendation in the low
      endemic countries on the indication of anti-tuberculosis drugs and practices are variable.

      Tuberculous anterior uveitis is distinguished by high rate of relapses and chronic uveitis
      upon discontinuation of topic corticosteroid therapy that exposes to broad posterior
      synechiae leading to an ocular functional impairment. Optimizing the management of recurrent
      anterior uveitis is therefore crucial.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, open, two parallel arm trial is to
      compared antitubercular treatment &quot;add-on &quot;of local corticosteroid therapy to Local
      Corticosteroid Therapy Only in patients with recurrent or chronic anterior uveitis.

      Primary outcome is the treatment succes defined as uveitis recovery at 3 months and the
      absence of recurrence at 18 months of follow-up.

    <description>Success is defined by uveitis recovery at 3 months and the absence of recurrence at 18 months of follow-up.
The intensity of the ocular inflammation will be evaluated using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) classification (score of cellular Tyndall and &quot;Flare&quot; of the aqueous humor) Failure is therefore defined as failure to recovery at 3 months of anterior uveitis or recurrence at 18 months.</description>
