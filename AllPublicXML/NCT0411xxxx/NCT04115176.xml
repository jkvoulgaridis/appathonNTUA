  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to evaluate the effects of both periodontal treatment and smoking on
      the gingival crevicular fluid(GCF) levels of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17E, Total oxidative
      stress(TOS) and total antioxidant capasity(TAOC) in smoking and non-smoking patients with
      severe chronic periodontitis.

      Systemically healthy 15 smoker,15 non-smoker with chronic periodontitis were attended for the
      study. Periodontal status were determined by recording periodontal clinical measurements. GCF
      samples were collected at the baseline, at the end of initial periodontal treatment and 4
      weeks after periodontal flap surgery. The data were tested statistically by the Student t and
      paired sample t tests.
