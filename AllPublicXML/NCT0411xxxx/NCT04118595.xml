  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a three component intervention to support shared
      decision-making during the early recovery phase for older adults who present to the emergency
      department (ED) with acute musculoskeletal pain. The first component is a brief interactive
      video to enhance patient knowledge and self-efficacy regarding treatment options with the
      intent of facilitating conversations between patients and emergency providers. The second
      component is a protocol-guided phone conversation (telecare) between a nurse care manager and
      the patient at 48-72 hours following ED discharge to assess pain severity and interference
      with daily activities, review analgesic use and side effects and recovery-promoting
      behaviors, and discuss adjustments to the patients treatment. The third component is
      communication with the patients primary care provider following the telecare call to inform
      them of the patients condition and treatment plan and encourage primary care followup. The
      short-term objective of this project is to test the efficacy of this intervention to reduce
      the transition from acute to chronic musculoskeletal pain among older adults and obtain data
      to inform implementation. The investigators will conduct a three-arm randomized controlled
      trial with adults aged 50 years and older who present to the ED with acute musculoskeletal
      pain. Patients will be randomized to (1) the full intervention (video + telecare +
      communication with primary provider), (2) video alone, or (3) usual care. The primary outcome
      will be pain, measured longitudinally over the course of the year following the ED visit.
      Secondary outcomes will include physical function, analgesic side effects and adverse events,
      opioid use, depression and anxiety symptoms, sleep duration and quality, and healthcare
      utilization at one, three, six, and twelve months. Secondary analyses will (1) examine
      whether the intervention has its effect by promoting shared decision-making, and (2) estimate
      the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The long-term goal of this work is to develop,
      test, and implement ED based interventions that improve long-term health outcomes for older
      adults with acute musculoskeletal pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be assigned to one of the three treatment arms using 1:1:1 randomization,
      stratified by access to a primary care provider, using randomly permuted blocks with random
      block sizes. (Primary care access will be determined using Source of Care questions from the
      Primary Care Assessment tool.) Randomization will be based on computer generated lists and
      allocated within subgroups based on access to a PCP using REDCap's integrated randomization
      module. One arm will receive the full intervention (educational video, telecare call,
      transmission of clinical information to the PCP), one will view the educational video only,
      and one will receive usual care. The investigators decided against a 2x2 factorial design,
      which would add a telecare only arm, because our team' s collective understanding is that a
      basic understanding of pain management (as provided by the educational video) is essential
      for effective SDM (shared decision-making) and often missing among older ED patients.
      Screening, consent, randomization, and ED assessments will be completed by the study
      coordinator. Interventions

      Educational Video: Development of the original video was funded by the John A. Hartford
      Foundation and used a systematic approach that included a review of literature and current
      pain management guidelines and input from emergency physicians, geriatricians, and experts in
      pharmacology, physical therapy, and risk communication. The video offers information about
      the pharmacologic management of acute musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and recovery-promoting
      behaviors. Each video section is followed by a multiple-choice question to promote
      interaction and reinforce learning. The actress for the 13-minute video is a 56 year old
      mixed-race woman who presents herself as a healthcare provider. The video will be shown to
      the patient immediately after randomization occurs which will be following the initial
      evaluation by an ED provider but prior to discharge from the ED. Patients will be in
      individual rooms, separated by walls or curtains. The video will be shown on an Apple
      fourth-generation iPad. Headphones will be provided to make it easier to hear and reduce
      possible contamination via exposure of other participants or ED providers to the video
      content. If the video is interrupted for medical care, the study coordinator will pause the
      video and exit the room, and then return to the room and resume the video after the care is
      completed. Changes to the video script have been made in the past 6 months including lowering
      the reading grade level to 5.5 and adding additional content. An updated video will be
      produced in the first year of the study.

      Telecare: Telecare will be provided via a protocol-guided phone call from a nurse care
      manager 48-72 hours after discharge from the ED. For efficiency, patients with no or mild
      pain (3 on 0-10 scale), no medication side effects, and no effect of pain on physical
      function will be given the opportunity to opt out of the call. The call is designed to
      support patient decision-making regarding analgesics and behaviors following the content
      presented in the video. Before the call, the nurse will review the note from the index ED
      visit to obtain information about comorbidities, medications, allergies, and the patient's
      evaluation and treatment in the ED. Topics covered in the call will include discussion of
      pain management goals and priorities, current analgesic use, non-pharmacologic methods of
      pain management, warnings about potential side effects, and open-ended questions to address
      additional patient care needs. Conversations will be guided by an SDM framework in which the
      nurse elicits information from the patient, then discusses with the patient alternative
      strategies, and actively elicits feedback from the patient. Patients will be encouraged to
      follow-up with their PCP; uninsured patients will be referred to local free or low-cost
      medical clinics. The telecare call is designed to last 15 minutes and the nurse will be
      trained to complete the call in 15 minutes.

      Correspondence with PCP: Following the telecare conversation, the nurse will enter a note in
      the EHR (Electronic Health Record) documenting the patient's current clinical status,
      information reviewed, and any recommendations or referrals made. The nurse will then share
      this note directly with the patient's PCP using a secure e-mail or an electronic message
      within the EHR if the PCP is a University of North Carolina (UNC)-affiliated provider. (If
      the PCP's email address is not available, the research staff will contact the PCP or their
      office by phone to obtain an email address or fax number.) This communication with also
      include: (1) The date, time, location and reason for the initial ED visit; (2) Results of ED
      diagnostics studies; (3) Discharge prescriptions/recommendations; (4) A summary of and link
      to the video, explaining the emphasis on patient knowledge and SDM; (5) summary of the
      telecare conversation; and (6) encouragement for follow-up. PCPs will be asked to confirm
      receipt of this message.

    <time_frame>Month 1 (following ED visit) to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is an 11-item measure of pain severity and pain interference. Patients will rate their pain severity and interference over the past week on a 0-10 numeric scale at 3 discrete time periods (1, 3, and 6 months). End points for the severity items include 0 which equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 which equals &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; End points for the interference items include 0 which equals &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 &quot;completely interferes.&quot; Higher scores reflect more pain severity and more pain interference. A composite score will be calculated by averaging scores from both the pain severity and interference items (all 11-items). Results from the 3 time periods will be analyzed longitudinally.</description>

    <measure>Side Effect Frequency and Severity Composite Score at discrete time points: 1 week and 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week &amp; 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (OR-SDS) will be used to assess subject-reported levels of frequency and severity concerning 10 symptoms known to be associated with opioid medication usage, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and constipation. Added to this measure are 5 other symptoms (including shortness of breath, falls, abdominal pain, bloody stool, and 'other'), reflecting side effects for patients taking NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Symptom frequency will be rated as: 1=rarely, 2=occasionally, 3=frequently, or 4=almost constantly, with higher ratings indicating more frequent symptoms. Symptom severity will be rated as: 1=slightly, 2-moderate, 3=severe, or 4=very severe, with higher ratings indicating more severe symptoms. Patients who deny a symptom will be given a score of zero for frequency and severity. A mean symptom distress score will be calculated for each arm based on patient reported scores for frequency and severity.</description>
