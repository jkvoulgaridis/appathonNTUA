  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Propofol-Controlled Phase III Clinical
      Trial. Around 260 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to either the HSK3486 arm or propofol arm. The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
      HSK3486 vs. propofol for the induction of sedation/anesthesia in subjects undergoing
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
