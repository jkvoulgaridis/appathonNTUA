  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the commonest cancers around the world. The current prognosis for lung
      cancer is poor, with a 1-year survival rate of only 42%. Thus, lung cancer imposes a
      substantial health burden on patients and society both locally and world widely. On top of
      the classical clinical therapies, additional approaches that could result in survival benefit
      are needed.

      Previous studies, including our own, have shown that physical exercise, such as aerobic
      walking, improves lung cancer patient's physical fitness particularly cardiovascular fitness,
      circadian rhythm and immune function. Another popular mode of exercise in Chinese population
      is tai-chi. With emphasis on breathing and concentration, tai-chi exhibits extra benefits for
      stress-relieving and psychological well-being. Those benefits of exercise have long been
      implicated for better survival of cancer patients. The promising benefits of aerobic exercise
      or tai-chi, as non-pharmacological interventions, urge for need of rigorous evidence on the
      effectiveness of these interventions in improving survival outcomes. However, to date, there
      has been no report from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the effect of aerobic
      exercise or tai-chi on survival of lung cancer patients.

      This proposed research is designed to conduct a three-arm RCT comparing aerobic exercise,
      tai-chi to usual care in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Recruited participants will be
      randomised into three groups: 1) a 16-week aerobic exercise group, 2) a 16-week tai-chi
      program group, and 3) a self-management control group. Aerobic exercise and tai-chi program
      will be conducted by certificated coaches. Life-long adherence to the practice in
      intervention groups is encouraged.

      Through this project, the investigators aim to evaluate if 1) aerobic exercise or 2) tai-chi
      intervention increases survival (measured by 1-year survival rate) in lung cancer patients
      compared to control, as the primary outcome of this study. The investigators shall also
      examine if tai-chi practice can provide similar survival benefits compared with ordinary
      exercise. Using biomarkers including circadian rhythm, cardio-respiratory fitness, and immune
      function further provides objective measures for bio-physiological effectiveness of the
      interventions. The associations of those biological measures and psycho-social status with
      survival outcomes will be further explored.

      Findings of this study will provide crucial information on the evidence-based practice by
      physical exercise or tai-chi to improve survival of lung cancer patients. This study will
      also have far-reaching significance in providing important scientific evidence to
      policymakers to integrate physical activity into routine clinical management as an add-on
      treatment for lung cancer patients in Hong Kong.

    <measure>Levels of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-week, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To measure compliance to exercise all participants will be measured for their level of physical activity in daily living. Physical activity will be quantified with a non-invasive small-size wrist-worn piezoelectric accelerometer (Actigraph; Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York). Actigraphy has been shown to provide valid assessments of physical activity. The user-defined time interval for the count of wrist accelerations is 1 min. Patients will be asked to wear the actigraph for at least 3 consecutive 24-hour spans. Each patient will keep a diary for times of rising and retiring.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-week, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cardio-respiratory fitness shall be evaluated using the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). The 6MWT has been widely used to assess cardio-respiratory fitness in lung cancer patients [28-30]. The 6MWT requires participants to walk on an even and flat surface between two cones set 30m apart, with the object being the participant walking as far as possible within the 6 minutes period (if participant cannot continue for the 6 minutes, the test will end). The walking test is measured in units of meters walked at the end of the 6 minutes.</description>

    <description>Fatigue will be measured by the Chinese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). The BFI was developed to measure fatigue in cancer patients. It consists of 9 items with each item scored on a 0-10 scale. The BFI measures patients' fatigue when symptoms are at their worst, least, usual and currently during the normal waking hours, with 0 indicating no fatigue, and 10 being fatigue as bad as one can imagine. Other items include fatigues interaction with patients' general activity, mood, waking ability, normal work (includes both work outside the home and housework), relations with other people, ability to think clearly, and enjoyment of life. The interference is measured with 0 being does not interfere, and 10 being completely interferes.</description>

    <description>The exercise intervention will last 16 weeks, comprised of home-based exercise with weekly telephone counselling to encourage participants to continue to exercise, supplemented with 8 supervised exercise sessions (2 sessions per month). Each session will last for an hour. The supervised exercise sessions will be provided by professional exercise specialists twice in the first week in each month throughout the intervention period, an hour each time. Exercise trainers will lead the classes. Each class will include both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise. They are encouraged to do aerobic exercise for at least 150 min weekly at a moderate intensity level, as well as perform resistance exercises alternate day. Participants are also provided an exercise diary, containing details of their weekly prescribed exercises and the scales they have to refer to.</description>

    <description>Our tai-chi classes will be based on a 16-form tai-chi exercise set. The classes will run twice a week for 16 weeks with each session lasting approximately 60 minutes. Classes will be taught by an experienced tai-chi master, who will explain the theory behind tai-chi and the principles of the techniques. The supervised session includes a warm up, self-massage and a guided run through of the movements, breathing techniques, and relaxation in tai-chi. The tai-chi master will guide participants to practice the tai-chi they learn in the classes at home each day. Upon completion of the 16 weeks course, participants will be encouraged to continue their tai-chi practice, given guidance on local services and programmes they may join if they wish to.</description>
