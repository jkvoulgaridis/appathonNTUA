  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BETTER-BP (Behavioral Economics Trial To Enhance Regulation of Blood Pressure) is a phase II,
      single-center, prospective, pragmatic randomized clinical trial within the New York City
      Health and Hospitals (NYC-H+H) system. The trial will recruit from 3 NYC-H+H ambulatory
      clinics, and will use a lottery incentive program to promote adherence to antihypertensive
      medication that will be delivered via smartphone for 6 months. The trial will randomize 435
      patients with hypertension determined to have poor adherence (&lt;80% adherence with
      antihypertensive medication), in a 2:1 (intervention:control) ratio. Baseline enrollment will
      occur over 36 months with an expected 12 months follow-up per participant.

    <measure>Self-efficacy measured by the Medication Adherence Self Efficacy Scale (MASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>a 26-item scale used to assess patients' confidence in their ability to take Antihypertensive medications. Items are scored from 1 (not at all sure) to 4 (extremely sure) and a total score on the measure is computed by averaging across responses to all items. Higher scores indicate a greater level of self-efficacy. MASES will be administered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to evaluate change over time.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>a validated screening tool consisting of 9 symptom questions that are scored on a scale of 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). A score of ≥10 is consistent with at least moderate depression.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary scores based on SF-12 responses will be calculated automatically using a proprietary algorithm (Optum Labs, Eden Prairie, MN), with higher scores indicating better health.</description>

    <description>Delivered by the Way to Health platform, installed on a smartphone and communicates with participants via text message.Participants are eligible to receive a potential cash reward if they are adherent with their antihypertensive medication the day before, which is monitored via electronic monitoring device (EMD) from AdhereTech. Each participant is assigned a 2-digit number for the trial, and each day the Way to Health platform randomly generates a 2-digit number. Participants will receive a prize if both digits match (1 in 100 chance) and will receive a prize of lesser value if one digit matches (18 in 100 chance). If they are not adherent with their medication, but would have won if they were adherent, they receive a text message that they would have won (&quot;regret&quot; component).</description>
