      This study will assess the clinical performance of the Quantra System with the QStat
      Cartridge in the liver transplant population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      propoerties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra QStat Cartridge was
      developed to monitor hemostasis in the trauma and liver transplant populations which may
      experience a range of coagulopathies of various etiologies including fibrinolytic defects.

      This single-center, prospective, observational stuey will evaluate the performance of the
      Quantra System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to corresponding measures determined
      using the TEG 5000.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Subject is undergoing deceased donor liver transplant and is a candidate for a TEG
             test to be performed to access coagulopathy during surgery.

          -  Subject is willing to participate, and is willing to consent (either prospectively or
             by deferred consent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is younger than 18 years of age

          -  Subject is known to have received antifibrinolytic therapy immediately prior to the
             start of liver transplantation surgery.

          -  Subject is unable to provide written informed consent (either prior to performing any
             study related procedures or by deferred consent)

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in a distinct study that might confound the results of
             the proposed study

          -  Subject is affected by a condition that, in the opinion of the clinical team, may pose
             additional risks
