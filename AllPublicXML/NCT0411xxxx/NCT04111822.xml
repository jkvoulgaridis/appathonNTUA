  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the high incidence, mortality and short and long term complications of sepsis and
      septic shock, it is necessary to look for strategies to try to minimize this impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current literature, we can affirm that the decrease in ascorbic acid levels in
      patients with sepsis and septic shock is directly proportional to the evolution to multiorgan
      failure and inversely proportional to survival. After assessing the safety in the
      administration of ascorbic acid as well as the decrease or almost abolition of its impact at
      the renal level after the association of thiamine, and the synergy provided by the
      administration of hydrocortisone, it is decided to implement the &quot;Metabolic Resucitation
      Protocol&quot; and assess its impact on our septic patients

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients&gt; 18 years of age with diagnosis of septic shock and multiorgan failure
             admitted to our Unit

          -  Entry into the ICU once diagnosed with sepsis and / or septic shock. The first 24
             hours after admission to the ICU will be established as an inclusion limit

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under 18

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Coexistence of other types of shock at admission

          -  Limitation of therapeutic effort or ICT (Conditional Intensive Therapy) upon admission
             to the ICU. It refers to patients in whom, prior to admission to the ICU, it was
             decided not to perform any or some of the usual treatment measures for sepsis, or in
             which a time limit is established in which in case of non-response they would withdraw
             intensive measures. This limitation will be indicated by your treating physician and
             if it exists, the patient would be excluded from the study.

          -  Patient with a history of previous intake of ascorbic acid, thiamine or
             corticosteroids in the month prior to admission to the ICU

          -  Patients considered immunodeficient (More than 10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent
             per day in the last 2 weeks, immunosuppressive therapy or diagnosis of acquired
             immunodeficiency syndrome).
