      Glycemic Index is a system of classification of different foods with significant levels of
      carbohydrates based on how they affect blood glucose levels after being consumed. Despite
      being a significant parameter of blood glucose, GI does not depict the effect of the food
      when taken in a controlled recommended amount, and so the Glycemic Loads (GL) must also be
      calculated, thereby measuring the impact on glycemic levels after consumption of standard
      food portion sizes. Dates are high energy foods consumed in various parts of the world, are
      known to be a source of several important nutrients and are also shown to have significant
      impacts in preventing illnesses due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial actions as
      well as preventative action against oxidative reactions The greatly frequent consumption of
      dates necessitates the identification of their GI and GL to ensure whether consumption is
      beneficial and safe for individuals. The objective of the study is to determine and compare
      the values of GI and GL of three varieties of dates in order to assess their safe consumption
      by individuals

    <intervention_model_description>40 participants will be included in the study and will be divided into four groups. The AKU faculty and staff will be invited to MDL with fasting of 12 hr. Written informed consent (a copy will also be provided to the participant) will be taken from each individual.Following vitals will be measured body weight, height and blood pressure. 1st group will be the control that will consume 50 g of glucose and 2nd, 3rd, and 4th group will consume 50 g of different kinds of dates. Their blood sugar level will be checked at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mins. Glycemic index and glycemic load will be calculated and will be compared.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Phoenix dactylifera, commonly known as date or date palm is a flowering plant species in the palm family, Arecaceae. Dates are the fruit of the date palm tree, which is grown in many tropical regions of the world. Dates provide a wide range of essential nutrients, and has certain protective effects on health of individuals.</description>
