  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of control (LOC) eating in children is associated with multiple physical and mental
      health impairments, including obesity and eating disorders. Little is known about the
      developmental neurobiology of LOC, which is crucial to specifying its pathophysiology and the
      development of effective preventive interventions. Individual differences in working memory
      (WM) appear to be related to LOC eating and excess weight status in youth, but the
      specificity and neural correlates of these individual differences are unclear. Failure to
      adequately understand the nature of associations between WM and eating behavior in children
      with overweight/obesity limits the development of appropriately-targeted,
      neuro-developmentally informed interventions addressing problematic eating and related weight
      gain in youth. To close this clinical research gap, the current study proposes to investigate
      the context-dependence of WM impairment and its neural correlates in children with
      concomitant overweight/ obesity and LOC eating as compared to their overweight/obese peers.

      Specific aims are to investigate:

      1)WM performance in youth with LOC eating relative to overweight/obese controls during
      recalls in the context of food-related versus neutral distractors; and 2) neural activation
      patterns during WM performance across both food-related and neutral stimuli. We hypothesize
      that, relative to their overweight/obese peers, youth with LOC eating will show 1) more
      errors and slower response times during recalls involving food-related vs. neutral
      distractors, and fewer errors and faster response times during recalls involving food-related
      vs. neutral targets; 2) increased activation in prefrontal regions during WM performance
      across stimuli types relative to overweight/obese controls, and 3) even greater activation in
      the context of food-related versus neutral distractors.

      The proposed study is the first to use state-of-the-science neuroimaging methodology to
      clarify the relations between WM and LOC eating, with strong potential to advance
      understanding of the associations among executive functioning, excess weight status, and
      eating pathology, and inform the development of interventions (e.g., WM training) to
      alleviate their cumulative personal and societal burden.

        Participants will be 30 children, ages 10-17, 15 of whom who are overweight/obese and
        report loss of control eating (i.e., at least 3 objectively or subjectively large loss of
        control episodes in the past 3 months), and 15 of whom who will serve as overweight/obese
        controls.
