      A two-stage design. An open, non-randomized, 3+3 dose escalating scheme will be used in the
      first stage of the study. A randomized (2:1) phase II open label study of DSC compared to
      Investigator choice Best Available Therapy (BAT) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant recipients with Grades II-IV steroid refractory acute graft vs. host disease in
      the second part of the study. Patients in each phase will receive 2 doses of DSC. In the
      second part (Phase II) additional doses (up to 6 doses) may be given depending on response.

      No cross-over are planned in the second stage of the study.

      Main inclusion criteria:

      Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with steroid refractory (SR) acute GvHD (aGVHD) grades II-IV
      after allo-HSCT.

      Signed written study informed consent once SR-aGvHD is confirmed. Evident myeloid and
      platelet engraftment

      Main exclusion criteria:

      Presence of an active uncontrolled infection including significant bacterial, fungal, viral
      or parasitic infection requiring treatment.

      Has received systemic treatment for aGvHD apart from steroids. Clinical presentation
      resembling de novo chronic GvHD or GvHD overlap syndrome. Any condition that would, in the
      Investigator's judgment, interfere with full participation in the study.

      Design:

      This is a phase I/II, multicenter, open-label trial of DSC in patients with steroid
      refractory acute GvHD grades II-IV.

      The trial will consist of 2 main parts: Phase 1 (open, non-randomized, 3+3 DSC dose
      escalating scheme), and Phase II, randomized (2:1), open label study investigating the
      efficacy and safety of DSC vs. BAT added to the patient's immunosuppressive regimen in adults
      with SR-aGvHD.

      Phase I dose escalating study. The main objective of the first part of the study is safety
      and tolerability of two different doses of DSC and to establish the optimal dose for the
      second, Phase II, part of the study. Six patients will be enrolled, 3 patients given the
      lower dose (1x10^6 DSC/kg) and 3 patients given the higher dose (3x10^6 DSC/kg). Patients
      will receive 2 doses of DSC (low or high) one week apart. If none of the initial 3 patients
      in the low-dose cohort experience a Severe Adverse Event (SAE), enrolment into the high dose
      level will commence. If the low and high dose in the Phase I study show similar safety
      results, the lower dose will be chosen for the Phase II, randomized study. The reason for the
      chosen doses in the phase I part is that in the pilot study, 1x10^6/kg showed very promising
      clinical results without any significant side-effects. The higher dose is chosen as this is
      the highest dose used clinically without any severe side-effects.

      The dose proposed for cohort 2 may change pending review of the data from the previous cohort
      by the Safety committee.

      In the second part of the study (Phase II) primary objectives will be safety and to compare
      overall response rate (ORR) at 28 days after randomization between patients receiving DSC
      with patients receiving BAT as treatment for SR acute GvHD grades II-IV. Target enrollment is
      70 patients, 47 in the DSC treatment-arm and 23 in the BAT arm. Patients will be given the
      optimal dose of DSC from the Phase I, dose escalating part of the study, as mentioned above.
      At least 2 doses of DSC will be given one week apart. Additional doses of DSC (maximum 6
      doses) may be given depending on response. Additional doses (beyond the first 2 doses) may be
      given one week apart until response, or whenever needed if aGVHD flare occur within 6 months
      after randomization (EOT).

      BAT: Investigator's choice Best Available Therapy (BAT) will vary depending upon
      Investigator's choice identified prior to randomization. Dose and frequency will depend on
      label (where approved) and institutional guidelines for various BAT.

      Primary objective

      In the phase I part:

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability profile of DSC

        -  Select the recommended DSC dose for the phase II study.

      In the phase II part:

        -  Assess the Safety of DSC.

        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR) at Day 28. Secondary objectives

        -  To assess Duration of response (DOR)

        -  To assess 1-year Overall Survival (OS)

        -  To assess 1-year Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)

        -  To assess incidence of infections

        -  To evaluate the safety of DSC and Best Available Therapy Exploratory objectives

        -  To assess the cumulative steroid dose until Day 56 and Day 90

        -  To assess Event-Free Survival (EFS)

        -  To assess incidence of Malignancy Relapse/Progression

        -  To measure the incidence of chronic GvHD

        -  To measure immune reconstitution

        -  To evaluate changes in Patient Reported Outcomes

Scoring procedures consist of summing the items with reversed scoring (0-4p where 0=best and 4=worst) for several items which produces individual subscale scores (0-24/28p) and an overall score (0-200p).
The FACT-BMT (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant) has a total of 50 questions. This is a questionnaire of general questions divided into four primary quality of life domains: physical well-being (PWB; 7-items), social/family well-being (SWB; 7-items), emotional well-being (EWB; 6-items); and functional well-being (FWB; 7-items), 18 items address the BMT related side effects, specifically designed to assess the BMT patients' quality of life. Five other questions from different QoL questionnaire were added as they were considered relevant to FACT-BMT.</description>

    <description>Placenta derived decidua stroma cells (DSC). In the first phase I part, two different dose levels will be used, 1x10^6/kg and 3x10^6/kg. Two doses, one week apart, will be given. The decision to proceed to the next dose level will depend on results observed at the previous dose level.
The dose in the randomized part will be based on the findings in the phase I part. In the Phase II study all patients will receive 2 doses, one week apart. Depending on response, up to 6 doses in total may be given. Additional doses (beyond the first 2 doses) may be given one week apart until response.</description>

The product consists of a viable allogeneic DSCs frozen in 5% of human serum albumin (HSA) in sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.9% and 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), that is thawed and immediately diluted in 40 mL sodium chloride (NaCl) 0.9% prior to infusion. That will give a final concentration of 2.2% HSA and 2% DMSO.
DSC will be infused when steroid-refractory acute GVHD after allogenic stem-cell transplantation has been diagnosed. Two doses, one week apart, will be given to all patients. Additional doses will be used depending on response.</description>
