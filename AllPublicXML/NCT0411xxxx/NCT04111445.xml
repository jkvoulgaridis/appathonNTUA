      This is a FIH, open-label, Phase I dose-escalation study of ADG116 in subjects with
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Study drug, ADG116, is an anti -CTLA-4 fully human
      monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human CTLA-4. ADG 116 administered
      intravenously (IV) over a period of 60-90 minutes. The study planned to treated 42 patients.
