    <textblock>
      A non-randomised mixed methods controlled before-and-after study. The study evaluated the
      effects of a classroom-based physical activity intervention in primary school children on
      physical activity. Two schools were allocated to deliver the classroom-based intervention for
      eight weeks, and three schools continued with their usual school routine.

      The primary aim of this study was to test the feasibility and potential effect of a
      classroom-based, curriculum-embedded intervention - ExCiTE; Exercise Classes in the Teaching
      Environment- on total physical activity and moderate to vigorous physical activity. The
      secondary aim was to measure and describe health-related quality of life and physical fitness
      components, and to gain understanding of the experiences, views and attitudes towards the
      ExCiTE intervention among participating children and schoolteachers.
