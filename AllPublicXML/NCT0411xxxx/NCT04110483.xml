  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ongoing efforts aim at overcoming the challenges of conventional transurethral resection of
      bladder tumor (TURBT) such as the high recurrence rate, difficulty of pathologic
      interpretation and complications including wall injury. Possible advantages may have en bloc
      resection of bladder tumor which was previously shown to be effective and safe technique. Use
      of novel thulium-fiber laser may also provide additional safety and efficacy of the
      resection.

      Objective. To prospective assess the safety and efficacy of Thulium-fiber en bloc resection
      of bladder tumor (Tm-fiber-ERBT) compared to TURBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      En bloc resection of bladder tumor (ERBT) was first employed by Kawada T. et al. in 1997. The
      technique showed promising results in terms of safety and tumor staging. Development of laser
      surgery and emergence of the holmium (Ho:YAG) and later thulium (Tm:YAG) lasers in the 1990s
      enabled laser ERBT with subsequent studies demonstrating high efficacy and safety of the new
      techniques. Ho:YAG and Tm:YAG ERBT have distinct advantages over conventional TURBT such as
      the complete absence of the obturator nerve reflex and hence, lower risks of perforation or
      bleeding as well as a higher quality specimens for pathologic examination, due to lack of the
      cautery effect. Recently, a new type of thulium laser was developed - that allows to decrease
      the penetration depth less than 0.15 mm, which is two times less than that of Tm:YAG. Another
      advantage is the decreased carbonization compared to Tm:YAG due to better water absorption of
      laser energy. All these aspects make Tm:YAG a precise tool that may improve the resection
      quality resulting in better management. Data on laser ERBT of NMIBC with Tm:YAG is limited
      and that on Tm-fiber laser ERBT is absent altogether. The investigators hypothesized that
      Tm-fiber laser ERBT would result in a lower probability of adverse events and better
      recurrence-free survival compared to conventional TURBT.

    <description>After cystoscopy and determining tumor topography, a circumferential incision around the tumor is made in the visually intact bladder mucosa (approximately 10 mm from the edges of the tumor). It allows for accurate morphological evaluation of the surgical margin. After that, the incision is continued deeper into the muscular layer. Having identified the layer, the surgeon resects the base of the tumor with the muscular layer using traction and incisions of the muscle fibers. Making incisions in the muscular layer requires precision, a full bladder and adequate guidance with visualization techniques. Traction may be employed with the help of the tip of the resectoscope or working element. After complete tumor resection, local hemostasis was performed.</description>
