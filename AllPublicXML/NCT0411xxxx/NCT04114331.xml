  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The original intent was to use a manual therapy and therapeutic exercise intervention with
      older patients with pneumonia post-hospitalization. It was hypothesized that the physical
      therapy intervention would have a positive impact on posture, physical function, pulmonary
      function, gait, quality of life, and ultimately readmission. This patient population was
      found to be not feasible to recruit and the study target population was expanded to include
      older community dwelling adults with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      or hyperkyphosis.

      This original study was a feasibility study to determine the ability to recruit and to assess
      pilot data to determine the effects of a physical therapy intervention on physical function,
      gait, balance, posture, pulmonary function, and quality of life. Additionally the 30 day
      readmission, ER visits, and mortality was to be tracked. This study failed due to lack of
      recruitment. However, the aim to examine the effectiveness a physical therapy intervention
      was still used just in a broader population. The intervention and measures remained the same
      except for 30 day admission/mortality data.

      The new aim was to examine the effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise on posture,
      function, gait, pulmonary function, and quality of life in older community dwelling adults
      with hyperkyphosis or forward head posture. Kyphosis, osteoporosis, decreased trunk
      flexibility, and pain are considered potential causes of restrictive lung function. The
      physical therapy intervention targets both soft tissue and skeletal restrictions to improve
      mobility. The outcomes were chosen to examine not only the direct impact on posture but also
      the indirect impact on physical function including pulmonary status. Lastly, cognitive
      mapping was used to record the change in the perceptions of the participants as they
      improved.

    <description>The intervention (3 times a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 12 sessions) consisted primarily of manual therapy (soft tissue and joint mobilization) followed by therapeutic exercises (muscular control and coordination).
Manual therapy:
Joint mobilizations (Grades I-V) to cervical spine, thoracic spine and ribs Soft tissue mobilization to the pectoralis, scaleni, upper traps, thoracolumbar fascia, erector spinae, and suboccipital musculature
Therapeutic exercises:
Strengthening of mid and lower traps, lats, glut med, and glut max. Active &amp; passive stretching of thoracic and lumbar rotation, hip flexors, and plantarflexors.
The treating therapists agreed on a protocol with treatment individualized to each patient.</description>
