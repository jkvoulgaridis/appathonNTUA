  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to Focused Ultrasound Ablation (FUSA) treatments with
      and without PD-1 blockade and with and without imiquimod. A device called the Echopulse will
      be used for the FUSA therapy. Patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts depending on their
      disease and treatment status. In Cohort 1, patients will receive FUSA therapy while receiving
      PD-1 blockade therapy as part of standard clinical care treatment. In Cohort 2, patients who
      discontinue or are ineligible for PD-1 blockade therapy will undergo FUSA without concurrent
      systemic therapy, with the goal of utilizing the FUSA to boost the innate immune response.
      The optional secondary regimen will combine FUSA (+/- PD-1 blockade) with imiquimod, which is
      a topical TLR7 agonist.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years.

          2. Advanced solid tumor with measurable disease in regional and/or distant metastases.

          3. Subject must have failed or have contraindication to standard therapies

          4. For Cohort 1, primary regimen (Regimen 1a): Patients with advanced solid malignancy
             for which PD1 or PDL1 antibody monotherapy administered on a 3-week schedule is
             FDA-approved for treatment, who have one or more tumor deposits that are accessible to
             focused ultrasound treatment, and who are eligible to receive (or to continue to
             receive) PD1 or PDL1 blockade therapy. Uveal melanoma patients are not eligible for
             Regimen 1a.

             Note: These patients may receive the primary protocol therapy (Regimen 1a) concurrent
             with PD1/PDL1 antibody therapy even if they may be eligible for other effective
             FDA-approved therapies in the following settings:

             Patients with stable disease after 12 weeks of PD1/PDL1 therapy per RECIST criteria
             may be eligible for Regimen 1a if their disease has remained stable on therapy and if
             their treating physician would normally continue PD1/PDL1 therapy even if they were
             not treated on this trial.

          5. For Cohort 1, secondary regimen (Regimen 2a): For those patients treated with primary
             regimen 1a, select participants may be enrolled in a secondary regimen. This would
             include participants in the following scenarios:

               -  Stable disease.

               -  Response in lesion treated in regimen 1, but persistent disease or progression in
                  a separate lesion.

               -  Initial partial response but still persistent disease at the treated lesion.

               -  Initial response followed by progression at treated lesion or separate site,
                  after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. If there is a response and then
                  progression at the site treated in Regimen 1 and the residual tumor meets
                  inclusion criteria, this lesion may be re-treated on the secondary regimen. For
                  participants who progress at a site unique from the treated lesion, they may
                  enroll in Regimen 2 and have this new lesion treated, as long as they meet all
                  inclusion criteria requirements.

             The patient must have a treatable tumor deposit in the dermis. The lesion to be FUSA
             treated in regimen 2 does not need to be the same lesion targeted in regimen 1. The
             patient must remain eligible for PD1/PDL1 Ab therapy. The length between the FUSA
             treatments in primary regimen and secondary regimen should be no less than 6 weeks.
             Patients who experienced an unanticipated device effect in the primary regimen are not
             eligible for the secondary regimen.

          6. For Cohort 2, primary regimen (Regimen 1b): The following patient subsets would be
             eligible for the Cohort 2 primary regimen, as long as they have failed (progressed or
             not tolerated) or are not eligible for all effective available approved therapies
             known to confer clinical benefit:

               -  Patients with advanced solid malignancy for which PD1 or PDL1 blockade is not
                  FDA-approved.

               -  Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma

               -  Patients with advanced solid malignancies for which PD1 or PDL1 blockade is FDA
                  approved but who are not eligible to receive that therapy because of prior
                  failure, toxicity, baseline autoimmune disease, or frailty.

               -  Patients who previously responded to PD1/PDL1 therapy but then progressed, if
                  there are no other systemic therapies available to them.

             Patients who were previously undergoing PD-1 blockade therapy must not have received a
             dose within 4 weeks prior to FUSA treatment.

          7. For Cohort 2, secondary regimen (Regimen 2b): For those patients treated with primary
             regimen 1a or 1b, select participants may be enrolled in a secondary regimen. This
             would include participants in the following scenarios:

               -  Stable disease.

               -  Response in lesion treated in regimen 1, but persistent disease or progression in
                  a separate lesion.

               -  Initial partial response but still persistent disease at the treated lesion.

               -  Initial response followed by progression at the treated lesion or a separate site
                  after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. If there is a response and then
                  progression at the site treated in Regimen 1 and the residual tumor meets
                  inclusion criteria, this lesion may be re-treated on the secondary regimen. For
                  participants who progress at a site unique from the treated lesion, they may
                  enroll in Regimen 2 and have this new lesion treated, as long as they meet all
                  inclusion criteria requirements.

             Patients enrolling to Regimen 2b must have a treatable tumor deposit in the dermis.
             The lesion to be FUSA treated in regimen 2 does not need to be the same lesion
             targeted in regimen 1. Crossover from primary regimen 1a is allowed if the patient is
             no longer eligible for continued PD1/PDL1 Ab therapy (e.g. due to autoimmune
             toxicity), and if there is no other effective systemic therapy option. The length
             between the FUSA treatments in regimen 1 and regimen 2 should be no less than 6 weeks.
             Patients who experienced an unanticipated device effect in the primary regimen are not
             eligible for the secondary regimen.

          8. One or more dermal, subcutaneous or nodal metastases from an advanced solid tumor. The
             metastases need to be accessible for FUSA and for biopsy.

             For FUSA:

             The targeted lesion(s) must be visible by ultrasound imaging and meet the following
             criteria. Brain lesions may not be targeted for treatment.

               -  Approximately 1 cm (or more) diameter of treatable tumor volume for lesions to be
                  treated with FUSA.

               -  The target treatment area needs to be contained within a region at least 5 mm
                  from the skin surface and less than or equal to 23 mm from the skin surface.

               -  The target treatment area must be at a safe distance from all critical
                  structures, including but not limited to ribs or other bony structures, vital
                  organs, named blood vessels or nerves.

               -  The critical structures, with the exception of the skin, will not be in the
                  pre-focal ultrasound path.

               -  The anterior-posterior dimension of the treatment area by US should be no less
                  than 9mm.

             For Biopsies:

             Biopsies may be completed with or without image guidance.

          9. Lesions that have been selected for focused ultrasound or lesions that have been
             selected for biopsies as untreated controls may have been previously radiated
             provided:

               -  The tumor site that was previously radiated has progressed.

               -  A baseline biopsy of the tumor site is obtained following progression and prior
                  to study entry.

         10. ECOG performance status 0-2.

         11. Subjects with brain metastases may participate if all of the following are true:

               -  There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since the most recent
                  treatment

               -  Neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline,

               -  There is no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases,

               -  Subjects are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to registration.
                  Regardless of dose, however, subjects who are on a steroid taper for management
                  of brain metastases are not eligible until 7 days after completion of that
                  steroid taper.

               -  Brain metastases will not be targeted for FUSA treatment.
