    <textblock>
      This trial will include patients undergoing radical mastectomy under general anesthesia. One
      group of patients will receive a pectoral nerve block, done by the anesthetist under
      ultrasound guidance at the beginning of the invervention. The other group will receive the a
      wound infiltration at the end of the intervention, done by the surgeon. Investigators will
      compare acute pain-related outcomes and chronic pain at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.

    <textblock>
      Mastectomies are associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain. In addition to
      general anesthesia, different methods of locoregional anesthesia exist to treat postoperative
      pain, amongst others a pectoral nerve block. This block consists in injecting local
      anesthetic between the muscles of the thoracic wall and is done under ultrasound guidance.
      Over the last few years, the pectoral nerves block has become a recognized option for the
      treatment of acute post-mastectomy pain and it is routinely performed in addition to general
      anesthesia.

      Data indicates that pectoral nerve blocks are effective for the treatment of postoperative
      pain during the first 24 hours after mastectomy, when compared to no block. However, the
      analgesic efficacy of a pectoral nerve block has never systematically compared to that of
      wound infiltration with local anesthetics, done by the surgeon at the end of the
      intervention. Such an infiltration is also currently employed.

      In our study randomize patients undergoing mastectomy under general anesthesia will be
      randomized to receive either an ultrasound-guided pectoral nerve block with 30 mL of local
      anesthetic (group PECS) or a wound infiltration with 30 mL of local anesthetic (group
      infiltration).

      Investigators will assess different pain-related outcomes over the first 24 postoperative
      hours, together with potential block-related side effects and patient satisfaction. Chronic
      postoperative pain at 3 and 6 months postoperatively will also be assessed.

      Both patients and outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation.
