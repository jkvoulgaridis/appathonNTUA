      Aim:This study was conducted to investigate the effects of music, kaleidoscope and video
      watching methods on children's pain perception and anxiety level during the blood collection
      procedures.

      Methods: This randomized controlled experimental study was carried out with 134 children in
      the 5-10 age group in the pediatric blood collection unit of a Training and Research Hospital
      between August and November 2018. In the study, nonpharmacological methods were applied to
      the children in the experimental groups (Music Group (n=33), Kaleidoscope Group (n=36), Video
      Group (n=31). The routine blood collection procedure was used for the children in the control
      group (n=34). The data were collected using the &quot;Introductory Information Form&quot;, &quot;Children's
      Fear and Anxiety Scale (CFAS)&quot;, and the &quot;Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WB-FPRS)&quot;.

    <description>The Children Fear Scale was used to evaluate the children's fear and anxiety. Children Fear Scale is a 0-4 scale, showing five faces that range from a neutral expression (0 = no anxiety) to a frightened face (4 = severe anxiety). Preprocedural and procedural pain, and anxiety were evaluated</description>

    <measure>Wong Baker Face Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Wong Baker Faces scale is a 0-10 scale. Six faces on the cards show a range of emotions from a smiling face (0 very happy/no pain) to a crying face (10 'hurts worst').</description>
