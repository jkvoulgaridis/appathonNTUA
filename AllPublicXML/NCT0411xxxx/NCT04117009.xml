      In this study ASA 1, 2 individuals with grade 1 or 2 diastolic dysfunction will be recruited
      to assess the effects of Remifentanil infusion on left ventricular function evaluated with
      transthoracic echocardiagraphy.

      Our aim in this study is to evaluate the effects of Remifentanil infusion on left ventricular
      function evaluated with transthoracic echocardiagraphy on ASA 1, 2 individuals with grade 1
      or 2 diastolic dysfunction. Methods: 30 ASA 1-2 individuals with grade 1 or 2 diastolic
      dysfunction whose left ventricular ejection fraction is above 50% will be recruited. The
      patients will be selected among the ones who planned to undergo elective surgery either under
      general or regional anesthesia.

      Patients with atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, severe heart valve disease,
      tachyarrhythmia-bradyarrhythmia, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% and regional
      contraction anomaly, patients with liver, renal dysfunction, patients with lung disease,
      acute coronary syndrome, body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2, no oral intake for solid food more than 8
      hours will be excluded from the study.

      Baseline echocardiographic examination will be performed in the spontaneously breathing
      subjects right before the surgical procedure and study drug begins. Then remifentanil
      infusion will be started at a rate to reach target plasma level of 2 ng/mL. A target
      Controlled Infusion pump will be used to infuse the study drug. Once the target drug
      concentration is reached, the final echocardiographic examination will be performed.

      After recording the baseline heart rate, respiratory rate, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse
      oximeter, sedation level, the same parameters will be recorded every 5 minutes during the
      remifentanil infusion period. Once the final echocardiographic evaluation is performed
      abovementioned parameters will be recorded for the last time.

      Statistical analysis: The sample size calculation is made according to an increase or
      decrease in E/e' (alpha &lt;0,05; beta= 0,8).

    <intervention_model_description>Baseline echocardiographic examination will be performed to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in the spontaneously breathing subjects right before anesthesia and study drug infusion begins. Then the same participants will be given remifentanil (ultiva at a concentration of 20 micg/ml) at a rate to reach a target plasma level of 2 ng/mL by means of a target controlled Infusion pump. Once the target drug concentration is reached (which is expected to take around 10-15 minutes), the final echocardiographic examination will be performed to assess systolic and diastolic function again.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Once the participants transferred to operating room, electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and respiratory rate will be recorded. An increase or decrease from the baseline value of 30% in mean arterial pressure will be treated with iv boluses of (5 mg) ephedrine or glyceryl trinitrate (25 micg). All the participants will undergo a baseline transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation to assess the systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle before the infusion of the study drug. Then the patients will be given oxygen by a face mask at a rate of 5-6 L/min, and Remifentanil infusion will be started using a target controlled infusion pump to reach a target plasma concentration of 2 ng/mL. Once the target concentration is reached, second echocardiographic evaluation to assess the systolic and diastolic function will be performed. Potential side effects of Remifentanil will be monitored.</description>
