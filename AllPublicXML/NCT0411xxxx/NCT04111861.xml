  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to determine the feasibility of delivering a Singing for Chronic
      Pain (SCP) programme to patients with chronic pain attending a pain clinic.

      The investigator will also be looking to provide a preliminary estimate of the benefit of SCP
      on self-efficacy, self -management skills, mindfulness and well-being as measured by
      standardized outcome measures.

    <description>EQ5D Quality of Life Questionnaire The EQ-5D questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation.Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.
In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).he answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

    <description>To investigate whether singing can help people to manage their chronic pain the applicants, working together with people with chronic pain, have developed a singing intervention, Singing for Chronic Pain (SCP). The development of the programme has been supported by Snape Moultings, an international centre for the arts which offered the team a residency to develop the programme (https://snapemaltings.co.uk/music/residencies/). The model takes a holistic approach using voice and singing, movement, sound, mindfulness and breath work to provide opportunities to connect body, voice, breath and mind. This is important given that people often use body dissociation as a way to cope with physical pain</description>
