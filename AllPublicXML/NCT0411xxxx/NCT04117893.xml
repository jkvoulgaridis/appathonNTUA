  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid is a common treatment for
      osteoarthritis of the knee. As a treatment drug for patients with depression, duloxetine has
      been shown in many studies to effectively relieve the pain of osteoarthritis and improve the
      function of the knee joint. However, there is no evidence regarding the efficacy of
      Intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid combined with duloxetine for
      pain management in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The aim of the study was to test the
      hypothesis that Intra-articular injection of corticosteroid plus hyaluronic acid combined
      with duloxetine could achieve superior pain management effects to Intra-articular injection
      of corticosteroid plus hyaluronic acid alone in patients undergoing knee osteoarthritis pain.

    <description>Weekly mean of the 24h average pain scores in participants with osteoarthritis knee pain at the end of 24 weeks as reported in participants' diaries based on the 11-point Likert scale (an ordinal scale with 0 indicating 'no pain', and 10 indicating 'worst pain imaginable')</description>

    <description>The response to treatment defines as a 30% and a 50% reduction of weekly mean score in 24-h average pain severity ratings from baseline to endpoint at weeks1,2,4,8,16 and 24 post-injection.</description>

    <measure>The Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-reported scale that will use to measure the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 post-injection. The severity of the pain was assessed by four questions: participants were rated on their most severe pain, their least severe pain, their average pain over the past 24 hours, and their current pain. The pain scale range from 0(no pain) to 10（extreme pain）. In the past 24 hours, seven questions assessed the impact of pain on daily activities, mood, walking ability, working normally, relationships with others, sleep and pleasure in life. The interference level ranges from 0(no interference) to 10(complete interference), and the average of the interference terms is obtained as a summary interference measurement.</description>

    <measure>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is designed to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of the knee and will be evaluate at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 post-injection. It consists of 24 questions: 5 on pain, 2 on stiffness, and 17 on physical function, each answered using a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). Higher scores on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index indicate worse pain, stiffness and functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>The Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>A patient-rated 7-point scale of symptomatic improvement, was assessed at all visits starting 2 weeks after treatment. On the The Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, a rating of 1 indicates that the participant is 'very much improved', a rating of 4 indicates that the participant has experienced 'no change', and a rating of 7 indicates that the participant is 'very much worse'. which range from 1 to 7.</description>
