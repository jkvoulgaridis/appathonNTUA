  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how the treatment of cancer with immune
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) leads to the development of autoimmunity. Specifically, we wish
      to understand the genetics and immune system features that cause a subset of cancer patients
      treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy to develop an immune-related adverse event (irAE).

      50 mls of peripheral blood will be drawn at the time that patients are prescribed an immune
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) which will be banked for serum and PBMCs. No more than 50 mls of
      blood will be drawn at three established subsequent points: at the time of the second drug
      infusion (8-12 weeks after the first infusion), at 6 months and at 12 months. Additionally,
      no more than 50 mls of blood will be drawn at any time that a participant develops an
      autoimmune complication.

      An assessment tool that queries symptoms suggestive of a number of common
      immunotherapy-related adverse events (PRO-CTCAE) will be administered to consented patients
      at each visit in concert with the standard-of-care patient reported outcomes tool currently
      in use in Cancer Center clinics.
