      The aim of the study is the evaluation of the possible role of PSMA PET-CT in early detection
      of prostate cancer, reducing rate of unnecessary prostate biopsies, and in cases of prostate
      cancer, correct staging of the disease and corresponding management.

      The aim of the study is the evaluation of the possible role of PSMA PET-CT in early detection
      of prostate cancer, reducing rate of unnecessary prostate biopsies, and in cases of prostate
      cancer, correct staging of the disease and corresponding management.

      Consequently, use of PSMA PET-CT in patients with suspicious PSA changes may improve our
      knowledge whether the prostate tumor is clinically significant or not (for the development of
      PSMA PET-CT with 68 Ga ligand allows to visualize prostate cancer with aggressive patterns),
      and improve clinical decision making for performing prostate biopsy or selecting patients for
      observation only.

      In light of the above, we are of the opinion that this proposed study has the potential to
      significantly alter the medical practice of how prostate cancer is diagnosed, which even
      today suffers from real clinical dilemma.

    <intervention_model_description>One investigator will interpret the PSMA PET-CT and another one will interpret MRI, both in a blinded and independent fashion and before the biopsy. At the end of the study, these 'blind' PSMA PET-CT and MRI reports will be compared to each other and to the actual fusion biopsy results. In the event that a high correlation is found between the diagnostic imaging results to those of the fusion biopsies, it would suggest that PSMA PET-CT could give the option to be performed instead of the need for biopsy in men who present with high levels of PSA and prompt treatment accordingly.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Ga 68 -PSMA PET/CT scanning will be performed using a combined PET/CT protocol with a 16-detector-row helical CT scanner (Philips Gemini GXL). This scanner allows simultaneous acquisition of up to 45 transaxial PET images with interslice spacing of 5 mm in one bed position and provides an image from the vertex to the thigh in about 10 bed positions. The use of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED-CC results in a relatively low radiation exposure, delivering organ doses that are comparable to those of other (68)Ga-labelled PSMA-inhibitors used for PET-imaging. Total effective dose is lower than for other PET-agents used for prostate cancer imaging (e.g. (11) C- and (18) F-Choline).</description>
