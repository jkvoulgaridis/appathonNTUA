  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI is used in clinical routine for diagnosing brain tumors, but has limitations in
      identifying tumor grade, true tumor extension and differentiate viable tumor tissue from
      treatment induced changes and recurrences.

      Amino acid PET has demonstrated a great potential for defining true tumor volume,
      differentiate viable tumor tissue from postoperative changes or radiation necrosis, selection
      of biopsy site, non-invasive grading of gliomas and for treatment planning and therapy
      response assessment. By combining PET with MRI, the diagnostic accuracy can improve
      significantly for these patients. More research is however needed to compare the most
      promising amino acid PET tracers in patients with glioma, but also to assess the diagnostic
      value of amino acid PET in patients with different brain metastases, where the knowledge
      concerning the uptake characteristics is limited.

      Three of the most promising amino acid tracers ([11C]-methyl-methionine (11C-MET), [18F]
      fluoro-ethyl-tyrosin (18F-FET) and anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid
      (18F-FACBC)) will be evaluated in 3 substudies in this project; WP1 Aminoacid PET/MRI in low
      and high grade glioma; WP2 Role of 11C-MET in high-grade glioma Gamma Knife® radiosurgery;
      and WP3 Amino acid PET in brain metastasis.

      The main aim of the study is to improve diagnostic accuracy, histopathological tissue
      sampling, delineation of tumor extent and therapy response assessment in gliomas and brain
      metastases with amino acid PET/MRI.

    <description>20 low-grade (LGG) and 40 high-grade glioma (HGG) patients will be included from the Department of Neurosurgery at St. Olavs Hospital and the Department of Neurosurgery at the University hospital of North Norway and examined with 18F-FACBC PET/MRI at baseline and 4-6 months after surgery. Furthermore, 10 of the LGG patients and 10 of the HGG patients will be examined with an additional 18F-FET PET/MRI at baseline for comparison with 18F-FACBC.
30 recurrent HGG patients will be recruited from the Department of Neurosurgery and the Department of Oncology at the Haukeland University Hospital. These patients will be examined with 11C-MET PET/MRI at treatment/baseline and 1 month after radiosurgery.</description>
