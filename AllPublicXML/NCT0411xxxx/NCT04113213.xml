  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing lifestyle changes to patients who are at risk of cardiovascular disease, may be
      an extremely cost effective mechanism of improving health for the individual themselves and
      the NHS. It is already proven that positive lifestyle changes such as improved diet,
      increased physical activity, quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption can lower the
      risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as reduce the risk of all-cause mortality.

      P-PLAC2 (Primary Care - Prescribing Lifestyle Adjustments for Cardiovascular Health) is a
      Phase II interventional study to determine the efficacy of a Lifestyle Prescription (LRx),
      from the viewpoint of patients and healthcare practitioners. The study uses a mixed methods
      design, and full study training and support will be provided to staff involved in the
      recruitment of patients, through to the behaviour change consultation, and end of study.

      If the study proves successful, a lifestyle prescription (LRx) could then be made available
      to support NHS staff throughout all disciplines (specifically those working with patients who
      are at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

    <intervention_model_description>The study is an interventional controlled observational study based in the Primary Care setting. Control groups will be utilized through the mechanism of wait-listing the enrolment of recruitment centres into the study.
Mixed methods will be used for both data collection and analysis. Historical clinical participant data (pre-intervention - from 12months) will be collected by the PI. Data will be collected immediately after the consultation and at 3 months post-intervention.</intervention_model_description>

Responses will be recorded to gain feedback from the patient participants regarding their thoughts and feelings of their consultation with and without the intervention of the prescription (LRx) - control vs interventional group. Initials responses from the questionnaires will be compared with the participants 3mth post consultation questionnaire to establish if they acted upon the guidance offered, and if they're thought and feelings had changed during the time.
Scale: 7 (minimum) to 41 (maximum). A lower value represents a better (more positive) outcome.</description>
