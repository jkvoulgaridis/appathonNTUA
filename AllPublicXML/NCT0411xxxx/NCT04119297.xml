  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During surgery, blood leaking from damaged blood vessels spread to the periorbital area may
      cause periorbital edema and ecchymosis after anterior craniotomy. This study was carried out
      to determine the effects of the cold application and the local heparinoid on periorbital
      edema and ecchymosis after craniotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periorbital edema and ecchymosis are common after anterior craniotomy. Periorbital edema and
      ecchymosis are not complications, they are natural outcomes of surgical trauma. However,
      periorbital edema prevents pupil examination and causes the patient to experience fear and
      anxiety with accompanying ecchymosis. Periorbital edema rate after anterior craniotomy was
      36.8-100%, ecchymosis rate was 62.5%, and 30% of patients with edema did not have a pupil
      examination for the first 36 hours after craniotomy.The present study was carried out to
      determine the effects of the heparinoid creams and regular cold application performed using
      gel packs in controlling periorbital edema and ecchymosis after craniotomy.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was conducted as a prospective, parallel, three arm (1:1:1), randomized controlled clinical trial at neurosurgical intensive care units (NICU) and neurosurgical clinics in two medical faculty hospital of a university in Istanbul, Turkey.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The random allocation cards was developed using a computer generated random number by a biostatistician who was not associated with the study. Group allocation was concealed using individual sealed opaque envelopes. As patients were enrolled in the study, the next envelope was extracted and the patients was assigned to the groups accordingly. When the patient was transferred from the operating theatre to the NICU or clinic, the nurse in the study (NA) assigned the patient to one of the groups according to the list in the envelope. Other investigator nurse (SY), two observer nurses (DG, YT), and all patients were blinded from group assignment. Also, all patients were blinded to all measurements and, the investigator and two observers were blinded to each other's measurements.</masking_description>
