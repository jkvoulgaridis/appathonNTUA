      Prospective collection of pre-defined parameters of AUS Surgery for Female Stress Urinary
      Incontinence due to Intrinsic Sphincter Deficiency

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective non-controlled cohort study evaluating the outcomes of artificial
      urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation surgery (Robot-assisted, Laparoscopic, Open or other) in
      female patients. The data collection will be undertaken from multiple centres in Europe. The
      participation will be by open invitation from the Urologists from the European Society of
      Female &amp; Functional Urology Section of the European Association of Urology (ESFFU) to all its
      members along with other surgeons undertaking these procedures. The aim is to recruit a total
      of 150 patients in 2 years whereafter patients will be followed until the end of Registry
      which is 5 years after inclusion of the first patient. There will be no restriction on the
      number of patients enrolled as long as they are consecutive. The aim is to have a long-term
      collection of the dataset from as many centres as possible.

      An initial assessment for the robustness of the data collection and first clinical evaluation
      of the data collected will be performed after 1 year by a nominated steering committee.
      Thereafter, the evaluations will be performed after every year until end of Registry.

    <description>Artificial Urinary Sphincter Surgery (Robot-assisted, Laparoscopic, Open, or other) for Female Stress Urinary Incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency is according to standard practice. Patients scheduled for this type of surgery will be asked to participate in this Registry.
At baseline and follow-up, the patients will be required to fill in Questionnaires, i.e. ICIQ -Urinary Incontinence - Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF), ICIQ Female Sexual Matters associated with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( ICIQ-FLUTSsex), ICIQ Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life (ICIQ-LUTSqol), Patient Global Impression of Improvement-I (PGI-I) which are commonly used in daily practice to assess urinary incontinence, sexual function and quality of life. During the yearly visits, patients will not be required to come for a clinical visit as the questionnaires and a Follow-up form can be completed by post, e-mail or phone call.</description>
