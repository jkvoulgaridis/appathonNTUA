      Aim and background:

      This study will seek to identify physiological and biochemical factors explaining and
      predicting a higher than expected central (aortic) blood pressure (BP) in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). The basic hypothesis of the study is that the degree of aortic
      calcification is an important component of elevated central BP, which, in turn, is important
      for the organ-damage and increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with CKD.

      Methods:

      Adult patients with varying degrees of CKD undergoing scheduled coronary angiography (CAG) at
      Aarhus University Hospital will be included in this study.

      During the CAG procedure, systolic and diastolic BP is determined in the ascending part of
      aorta by a calibrated pressure transducer connected to the fluid-filled CAG catheter.

      Simultaneous with the registration of invasive aortic BP, estimation of central BP is
      performed using radial artery tonometry (SphygmoCorÂ®), while a corresponding brachial BP is
      also measured.

      Prior to the CAG, a non-contrast CT scan of aorta in its entirety will be performed to enable
      blinded quantification of calcification in the wall of aorta and coronary arteries.

      Furthermore, echocardiography, resting BP measurement and a range of blood- and urine samples
      will be performed.

        criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria.
