  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to explore the effectiveness of using acupuncture versus
      aromatherapy, in conjunction with standard of care anti-emetics, to decrease chemotherapy
      induced nausea, vomiting, and anxiety in breast cancer patients undergoing Adriamycin and
      Cytoxan. This study also aims to determine if aromatherapy and anti-emetics is more effective
      than acupuncture and anti-emetics in treating nausea, vomiting, and anxiety in patients
      receiving Adriamycin and Cytoxan and if acupuncture and anti-emetics is more effective than
      aromatherapy and anti-emetics in treating nausea, vomiting, and anxiety in patients receiving
      Adriamycin and Cytoxan.
