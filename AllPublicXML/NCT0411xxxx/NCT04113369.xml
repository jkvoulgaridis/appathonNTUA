    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how cross-education (unilateral training) affects muscle strength of the
      paretic limb in acute stroke patients. Half of the hemiplegic patients will receive
      conventional treatment and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to non-paretic
      side, while other half will receive conventional treatment and electro muscular stimulation
      (EMS) to non-paretic side.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cross-education, which means the performance improvement in the untrained homologous muscle
      after unilateral exercise training, is studied in various orthopedical and neurological
      conditions affecting the body unilaterally. For those with asymmetrical weakness and
      immobility after stroke, training the non-paretic side can be utilized to increase the
      strength of the paretic side and improve functional symmetry. In this study, investigators
      aim was to examine whether training non-paretic upper extremity wrist flexor muscles by EMS
      in adjunct to conventional training program, has additional benefits upon the muscle powers
      of the homologous agonist and antagonist muscles. Investigators will use low frequency
      antalgic TENS stimulation at barely sensible level, which is considered not to cause muscle
      strengthening, as a control intervention.

    <measure>The Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment for upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is designed to assess reflex activity, volitional activities (within synergies, mixing synergies, with little or no synergy), wrist and hand joint functioning, and coordination of the upper extremity in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. This scale is an ordinal scale that has 3 points for each item. A zero score is given for the item if the subject cannot do the task. A score of 1 is given when the task is performed partially and a score of 2 is given when the task is performed fully. However, reflex activity is measured using 2 points only, with a score of 0 or 2 for absence and presence of reflex respectively. Maximum score in the upper limb is 66 and higher scores represent a better outcome</description>

    <measure>The functional independence measure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is an assessment tool which evaluate the functional status of patients throughout the rehabilitation process. Degree of disability depends on the patient's score in 18 categories, focusing on motor and cognitive function. Each category or item is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = &lt;25% independence; total assistance required, 7 = 100% independence. Total score varies between 18 to 126 and higher scores represent a more independent patient</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brunnstrom stage of recovery for hand</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This staging evaluates patient according to six sequential stages of recovery as stage 1: flaccidity, 2: basic limb synergy with minimal spasticity, 3: synergy with marked spasticity, 4: limited ability to move normally with reduced spasticity, 5: complex movement combinations, and 6: motor control is almost fully recovered. A patient can plateau at any stage but if able to reach stage 6 he or she makes full recovery</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum and mean strength of paretic wrist flexors</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>While the patient lays in supine on a bad, a physician stabilizes the forearm of the patient and measures the wrist flexion power with a manual muscle tester device while patient's forearm is in supination. This device can measure maximal power and mean power during 10 seconds of pressure. Circular cap of the device is used as application surface and the cap is placed on palm for wrist flexion for measurement. Then the patient is asked to perform a maximum wrist flexion for ten seconds. The device notices the patient for time with two sounds at starting or finishing the measurement. The maximum and mean wrist flexion force, wrist extension force is recorded in kilograms after the measurement.</description>

    <description>While the patient lays in supine on a bad, a physician stabilizes the forearm of the patient and measures the wrist extension power with a manual muscle tester (Lafayette instrument company, IN, USA) device while patient's forearm is in pronation. This device can measure maximal power and mean power during 10 seconds of pressure. Circular cap of the device is used as application surface and the cap is placed on the middle of hand dorsum for wrist extension measurement. Then the patient is asked to perform a maximum wrist extension for ten seconds. The device notices the patient for time with two sounds at starting or finishing the measurement. The maximum and mean extension flexion force is recorded in kilograms after the measurement</description>
