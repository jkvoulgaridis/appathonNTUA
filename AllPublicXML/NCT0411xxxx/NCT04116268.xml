    <textblock>
      The participants are divided into subjects or controls based on the BMI taken during the
      first trimester of pregnancy upon recruitment. Participants with a BMI of â‰¥23kg/m2 were
      recruited as subjects (labelled as obese group) and those with BMI of 18.5-23kg/m2 were
      recruited as controls. Total gestational weight gain was calculated based on the difference
      between third trimester weight and first trimester weight. All participants who fulfilled the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited after informed consent. Demographic data of
      all participants were recorded. At first trimester, the participants' weight and height were
      recorded for calculation of BMI. At every trimester visit, the following were recorded: i)
      blood pressure using sphygmomanometer after 15 minutes of rest ii) mid-stream urine for
      presence of proteinuria iii) weight. The participants were followed up until the point of
      delivery. Occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcome, fetal outcome, and birth weight were
      documented. The pregnancy outcomes measured in this study included the need of primary
      caesarian section, the occurrence of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), pre-eclampsia, and
      gestational age at delivery. The neonatal outcomes measured in this study included neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) admission, stillbirth, preterm delivery, occurrence of macrosomia
      and low birth weight, and neonatal birth weight.
