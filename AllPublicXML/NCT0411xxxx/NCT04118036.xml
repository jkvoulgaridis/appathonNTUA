      This research study is studying a combination therapy as a possible treatment for recurrent
      glioblastoma (GBM), a brain tumor that is growing or progressing despite earlier treatment.

      This study will involve participants with recurrent glioblastoma at their first relapse
      enrolled in two arms including patients who require reoperation and patients not requiring
      surgery.

      This research study involves a combination of two drugs:

        -  Pembrolizumab (MK3475)

        -  Abemaciclib (LY2835219)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease.

      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the
      body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are
      substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers
      CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the
      growth of tumors.

      In laboratory studies, abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from
      making cells, and slow growth of glioblastoma in mice.

      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer.
      Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may be beneficial
      inrecurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody.
      An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance.
      Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be
      produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients; an antibody that is made in the lab
      is also known as a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to block the action of the
      receptor, PD-1. PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. There are now
      several approved antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be
             eligible to participate in the study:

               -  Participants must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed
                  consent document.

               -  Participants must be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree
                  to record medication times accurately and consistently in a daily diary.

               -  Participants must be at least 18 years old on day of signing informed consent.

               -  Participants must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 70 (see Appendix
                  A).

               -  Participants must be able to swallow oral medications.

          -  Nature of illness and treatment history

               -  Participants must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma or
                  variants. Participants will not be eligible if the prior diagnosis was low-grade
                  glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or variants was
                  made (e.g. secondary GBM).

               -  To be eligible for the study all participants (Cohort 1 and 2) are required to
                  provide genomic profiling data from a sequencing-based assay and must include
                  reporting of the RB1 gene in explicit terms within the report. Only sequencing
                  assays that include coverage of all exons of the RB1 gene are able to be utilized
                  (most commonly called a targeted exome assay; e.g. Oncopanel, Impact,
                  FoundationOne). In addition, patients must provide a report of copy assessment
                  which reports status of RB1. The reporting may be from a copy array (ideally
                  Oncoscan SNP array or Agilent array CGH) or can also be from sequencing assay if
                  copy status is explicitly provided with quantitative information regarding the
                  status of relevant genes.

               -  Inactivation of CDKN2A/B or C in the tumor by homozygous deletion (evidence for
                  more than single copy loss for any of the genes defined as copy array log2 ratio
                  of &lt;0.3 by copy array; or from sequencing data with sufficient coverage for
                  evaluation). Rearrangement/evidence or intragenic breaks by copy or sequencing
                  assay also will be considered eligible for study (any copy status).

               -  Validation of wild-type RB status (no deletion/losses more than single copy by
                  copy number or sequencing data; and/or no inactivating mutations or rearrangement
                  by sequencing).

               -  Participants must be at first relapse of GBM. Relapse is defined as progression
                  following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that was used as initial
                  therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 1 prior therapy
                  (initial treatment). If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease
                  and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient
                  undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse.

               -  Participants must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or
                  CT scan.

                    -  For Cohort 2 subjects, CT or MRI within 14 days prior to study registration.
                       For Cohort 2, corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least
                       5 days prior to the scan. If steroids are added or the steroid dose is
                       increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT scan and the start of
                       treatment, a new baseline MRI or CT is required.

                    -  For Cohort 1 subjects, CT or MRI should be performed ideally within 14 days
                       prior to study registration, but because the screening MRI for this subset
                       of subjects will not be used for evaluation of response, it is acceptable
                       for this MRI/CT to have been performed greater than 14 days prior to
                       registration if unavoidable. Furthermore, for this same reason, fluctuation
                       in corticosteroid dose around this MRI does not warrant repeat scan so long
                       as there is documented unequivocal evidence of tumor progression available.

               -  Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery
                  demonstrating glioblastoma or variants for correlative studies is required prior
                  to enrollment; these samples must be sent to the DFCI Coordinating Center within
                  60 days of registration.

        The following archived tissue is required for Cohort 2 patients:

        --- 20 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 5 micrometer
        thickness).

        The following amount of archived tissue is required for Cohort 1 patients:

          -  20 unstained formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections (standard 5 micrometer
             thickness)

          -  For Cohort 1 subjects, there must be &gt; 2cm2 enhancing tissue available for resection
             and submission for study correlatives as determined by local treating team. NOTE: if
             the above-mentioned tissue is not available from the most recent surgery revealing
             GBM, participants may be enrolled with tissue available from any prior surgery
             revealing GBM with prospective approval from the Overall PI. An interval of at least
             12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to start of study drug unless there
             is a new area of enhancement consistent with recurrent tumor outside the radiation
             field (defined as the region outside the high-dose region or 80% isodose line) or
             there is unequivocal histologic confirmation of tumor progression.

               -  Participants must have recovered to grade 0 or 1 or pre-treatment baseline from
                  clinically significant toxic effects of prior therapy (including but not limited
                  to exceptions of alopecia, laboratory values listed per inclusion criteria, and
                  lymphopenia which is common after therapy with temozolomide).

               -  From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods
                  must have elapsed:

          -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from any investigational agent;

          -  4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide; 6 weeks from
             nitrosoureas);

          -  4 weeks from antibodies;

          -  4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.

          -  2 days from Novo-TTF

               -  Participants with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or
                  stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive disease based
                  upon nuclear imaging, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging or histopathology.

               -  Participants having undergone recent resection or open biopsy or stereotactic
                  biopsy of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible for Cohort 2 as long as
                  the following conditions apply:

          -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery.

          -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
             eligibility.
