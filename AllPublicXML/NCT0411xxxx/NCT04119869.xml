  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone
      application intervention, called iaya, among young adults with cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The iaya app was developed by clinicians from the Young Adult Program at the Dana-Farber
      Cancer Institute. The iaya app is a smartphone application intervention that -through a
      variety of approaches, such as exercises aimed at identifying and changing thoughts and
      behaviors, imagery, and relaxation- seeks to enhance coping with the emotional impact of
      cancer.

      The investigators are conducting this study to see if the iaya app, specifically developed
      for young adults with cancer, is practical, to determine patient satisfaction with the iaya
      app, and to test study procedures.

    <measure>Number of participants who log in at least 10 times and open at least 3 coping skills exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of iaya will be determined by calculating the percent of participants assigned to the iaya app who log in at least 10 times. Percent of participants assigned to the iaya app will open at least 3 coping skills exercises will also be considered as a component of feasibility.</description>

    <measure>Mean score on app usability questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be assessed with the 6-item app usability questionnaire rated on a Likert scale (0=strong disagree to 5=strongly agree). Items will prompt participants to rate the extend to which they would use this app frequently, found the app to be easy to use, well organized, learn how to use the app quickly, felt confident using the app, and if they found the app interactive. Scores can range from 0-30. Higher scores indicate higher perception of usability.</description>

    <measure>Change in coping scores on the Cancer Behavior Inventory Brief Form</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will pilot the 12-item Cancer Behavior Inventory Brief Form (CBI-B) for future efficacy studies. The CBI-B measures self-efficacy for coping with cancer. Items are scored between 1 (not at all confident) to 9 (totally confident). Higher scores indicate a higher level of self-efficacy for coping with cancer.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy scores on the PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Emotions Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will pilot the 8-item PROMIS Self-Efficacy for Managing Emotions (PROMIS SEMEM) for future efficacy studies. The PROMIS SEMEM will be used to measure confidence to manage or control symptoms of anxiety, depression, helplessness, discouragement, frustration, disappointment, and anger. Items are scored on a scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident). Higher scores indicate a higher level of self-efficacy for managing emotions.</description>

    <measure>Change in emotional support on the PROMIS Emotional Support Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will pilot the 12-item PROMIS Emotional Support (PROMIS ES) for future efficacy studies. The PROMIS ES measures perceived feelings of being cared for and valued as a person. Items are scores on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived emotional support.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will pilot the 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) for future efficacy studies. The FACT-G consists of four sub scales: physical, emotional, social/family, and functional well-being. Items are scores between 0 (not at all) and 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate a higher level of quality of life.</description>
