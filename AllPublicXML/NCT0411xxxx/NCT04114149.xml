  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation)
      treatment for first line of treatment compared with conventional treatment with opioids on
      pain relief and time spent time in the post-anesthesia care unit after laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. Half of the patients are randomized to TENS as first line of treatment and
      the second half is randomized to conventional opioid treatment. Patients who does not report
      postoperative pain which requires treatment are used as controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is often a problem after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Conventional
      treatment with intravenous (iv) opioids often offers satisfactory pain relief. However,
      opioids have negative side effects, such as sedation, nausea, and respiratory depression.
      Some of these side effects require monitoring of the patient, resulting in longer duration of
      stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after surgery. Transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) has been used to provide pain relief in various postoperative pain
      conditions. Previous studies from the investigator's center indicate that TENS treatment for
      postoperative pain after gynecological surgery results in shorter time in the PACU.

      Previous studies indicate that patients reporting pain intensity associated with venous
      cannulation to &gt; 2 VAS (visual analog scale) units have higher risk of postoperative pain in
      the PACU. The aim of the study is to compare time spent in the PACU and to compare the
      postoperative pain relieving effect of high frequency, high intensity TENS as first line of
      treatment with conventional treatment with iv opioids in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. Furthermore, the study evaluates if postoperative opioid consumption can be
      reduced by using TENS as first line of treatment. In addition, the study tests if pain
      intensity associated with venous cannulation can be used to predict occurrence of
      postoperative pain.
