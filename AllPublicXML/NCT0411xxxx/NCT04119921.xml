      Purpose: To evaluate the short-term effect of adding topical ketorolac to the management of
      diabetic macular edema (DME) with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB).

      Setting: Ophthalmology department of Imam Hossein and Torfe Medical Centers. Ophthalmic
      Epidemiology Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Methods: In a
      randomized double-masked placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial, all eyes with DME with
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 20/40 and 20/400 were included. They should have
      had at least one intravitreal anti-VEGF injection in the past 2 months. They were randomized
      into two groups. Both groups received two IVB injections with 6-week interval. One group
      received topical ketorolac every 6 hour in the first interval and then artificial tear every
      6 hour as a placebo in the second interval. The other group received the opposite
      medications. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT)
      evaluations were repeated at the termination of each treatment period i.e. at 6 and 12 weeks.
      The main outcome measure was BCVA changes in logMAR and the second outcome was CMT changes.
      The interim analysis of this study is presented in this report.
