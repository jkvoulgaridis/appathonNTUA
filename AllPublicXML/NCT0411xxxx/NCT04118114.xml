  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, single dose level study of PRL3-ZUMAB monotherapy in patients
      with advanced solid tumours that have failed standard therapy. Approximately 30 patients will
      be recruited with ~10 gastric cancers and ~10 hepatocellular carcinomas. Patients who have
      received at least 1 dose of PRL3-ZUMAB will be evaluable for toxicity and efficacy.

      PRL3-ZUMAB will be given IV every 2 weeks for up to 12 infusions in the absence of
      unmanageable toxicities or disease progression. Patients who are benefitting from the
      treatment may continue on PRL3-ZUMAB beyond 12 infusions with the agreement of the study drug
      provider.

      PRL3-ZUMAB at the RP2D in tumour types enriched for known PRL-3 expression for efficacy and
      tolerability will be evaluated. There will also be in depth molecular profiling of tissues in
      patients who have an objective response or prolonged disease stabilization to identify
      predictive/selection biomarkers as well as evaluation of the oncogenic signaling modulation
      and immunomodulation by PRL3-ZUMAB and its potential for future combination with other
      targeted therapies or immunotherapy.
