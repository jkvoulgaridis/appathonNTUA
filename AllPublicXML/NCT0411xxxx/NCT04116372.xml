  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based health promotion programs have the potential to reach more individuals than in
      person interventions, without overtaxing healthcare resources. Having a high quality,
      user-centered web-based program can help maximize user engagement and adherence. Thus, the
      primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a
      web-based physical activity behavior change program on recently retired and/or empty nest
      populations. The primary research question is: Is it worthwhile to conduct a larger scale
      eHealth study targeting empty nest and/or retired populations based on preliminary results
      and feedback from this pilot study. We will also be examining changes other behavioral
      indicators related to physical activity as a secondary outcome measure.

      Background: Physical activity is associated with management and/or prevention of over 25
      chronic health conditions; however the majority of adults in North America are not active
      enough to experience these benefits. Behavioral strategies have been shown to be effective
      for increasing physical activity, and our online platform includes components of several
      behavioral strategies including goal setting and feedback.

      Target Population: Sedentary adults who have recently (within 6 months of enrollment)
      retired, or had their last child leave the family home, living in Victoria, British-Columbia,
      Canada.

      Sample Size: 80 participants, 20 participants per group - Empty Nest (Control) Empty Nest
      (intervention), Retired (Control), Retired (Intervention).

      Intervention: Participants in each Empty Nest and Retirement participant pool will be
      randomized to two groups: 1 - Waitlist control group, 2 - Access to Online Platform. Half of
      the empty nest participant group and half of the retired participant group will receive an
      intervention, with the other half representing the control comparison group. Participants
      from both groups will complete an online questionnaires at baseline and 10 weeks. The
      intervention group will also be asked for an in-person exit interview.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the full scale RCT, we are looking for a 1 day per week or 30 min MVPA change which equates to an approximate effect size of d = .35. This equates to roughly 65 per group (130 for a two group trial). If we recruit for 2 years in the large trial (assuming a six month time period for each person in the intervention) we need to be recruiting at least 6 per month. If we decide on a three armed trial, we will need to recruit at least 8 per month.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant retention</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who complete both baseline and end of study (10 week) measures. A 80-100% retention rate is indicative of a strong trial (Jackson &amp; Waters, 2005).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant intervention satisfaction/evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For satisfaction ratings, mean and standard deviations will be calculated for the quantitative satisfaction and evaluation questionnaire. Given that scores of 1 (ex. not helpful, did not use the tools) and 2 (ex. Somewhat helpful, used a little bit of the tools) indicated levels of dissatisfaction, and 3 (ex. Quite helpful, used a bit of the tools) and 4 (ex. Extremely helpful, used a lot of the tools) indicated some sort of satisfaction, a mean score of â‰¥ 2.5 will be deemed acceptable for recommendation for a full RCT.</description>

    <description>Measured from questionnaire using Godin's personal self report leisure time measurement tool, also known as the Leisure Score Index (LSI). The Leisure Score Index contains three questions, which assess the frequency of mild, moderate, and strenuous activity performed for at least 10 minutes during free time in a typical week. Changes in these measures will be examined</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a baseline questionnaire, and receive access to the our online platform for 10 weeks. Completing the online platform is designed to encourage participants to engage in physical activity. At 2 and 5 weeks, a check-in session will occur over the phone. At 10 weeks the participant will be contacted to return to the lab to complete the final questionnaire, and do a wrap up interview. The end-of-trial qualitative interview will evaluate participant satisfaction and feasibility of the intervention. For this reason a lab employee unaffiliated with this study will complete these in person interviews.</description>
