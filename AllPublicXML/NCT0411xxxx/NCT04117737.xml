  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve knowledge about mechanical gait assistance combined with
      virtual reality efficiency in gait recovery for Parkinson´s patients. It is hypothesised that
      12 sessions of 30 minutes each, over a 4 weeks period, of antigravity treadmill
      rehabilitation combined with virtual reality treatment is effective for increase gait
      autonomy in patients with Parkinson's disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in gait autonomy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in gait autonomy will be measured by 6-Minutes Walking Test (6MWT). The 6MWT consists of measuring the maximum distance (in meters) that the subject can walk during 6 minutes in a flat surface.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in gait speed will be measured by 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT). The 10MWT consists of asking the subject to walk a 14m distance on flat area and measure the time spent from meter 2 to meter 12. Time will be measured by a digital chronometer. Gait speed will be calculated in meter per second.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in balance and gait ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in balance and gait ability will be measured by Tinetti scale. The Tinetti test is a simple, reproducible way of assessing the risk of falling in the elderly. This scale is composed of two value, static and dynamic: the test grants a maximum of 16 points for static part (sitting) and 12 point for dynamic (walking) part. Higher is the score, better is the performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life will be measured by by 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). SF-36 assesses 8 physical and mental health domains: 1) Physical Functioning, 2) Social Functioning, 3) Role-Physical, 4) Bodily Pain, 5) Mental Health), 6) Role-Emotional, 7) Vitality, and 8) General Health. For each scale, item scores are coded, summed, and transformed, with final values expressed as a percentage, ranging from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health).</description>

    <description>The system is composed of three major parts: the treadmill, the antigravity system and the virtual reality system.
The treadmill is the base of the device. It is a rounded and concave structure that permits to walk in all direction. For simulate anti-gravity, a harness and pulley system allow to regulate the weight. Finally, the virtual reality system enables participants to simulate an experience of daily life.</description>
