  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle sprain is very common. In France, its daily incidence is estimated at 6000. It often
      causes pain, a temporary period of disability and can results in recurrence and chronic ankle
      instability. Therefore, an early management and follow up treatment is necessary. Now,
      functional treatment is clinically the treatment strategy of choice for ankle sprain. It is
      based on rest, ice, compression, elevation and can use a functional support (like an ankle
      brace). To evaluate gravity and improve management, a clinical assessment delayed between 4
      and 5 days post injury is necessary.
