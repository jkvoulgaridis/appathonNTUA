  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate efficacy and safety of rifaximin (L-105) in
      patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction(CIIPO) or patients with
      chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), secondary to systemic scleroderma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, comparative study,
      when patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction(CIIPO) or patients with
      chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), secondary to the onset of systemic scleroderma,
      are administered rifaximin at 400 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks. In addition, the time course
      of symptoms of the patients are to be confirmed for 8 weeks after the end of administration.
