  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis is a common motor disorder after a stroke. The majority of patients do not
      recover functional use of their paretic upper limb.

      The use of mirror therapy allows the activation of the mirror neurons involved to stimulate
      brain plasticity after brain damage.The IVS (Intensive Visual Stimulation) device allows an
      easy implementation of mirror therapy by filming the valid upper limb and projecting the
      inverted image onto a screen placed above the parietal arm thus producing the illusion of
      movement of the parietal arm.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that the structured practice of a large number of upper
      limb targeted movement repetitions using an intensive visual numerical simulation device as a
      partial replacement for routine care (conventional occupational therapy) in the sub-acute
      phase of stroke will increase the active function (motor function and functional abilities)
      of the distal end of the upper limb compared to conventional rehabilitation.

      Objectives: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of partial
      substitution of routine care (occupational therapy) by structured movement repetition
      programs by Intensive Visual Simulation using an IVS3 device, on the distal motor control of
      the upper hemiparesis limb, between 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, compared to a program
      with conventional care alone.

      Hemiparesis is a common motor disorder after a stroke. The majority of patients do not reuse
      their paretic upper limb.

      Hypothesis: The structured practice of repeating upper limb movements by Intensive Visual
      Simulation will increase distal motor control, and improve the objective functional abilities
      of the upper limb.

      Main Objective:Evaluate in a controlled protocol the effects, on the distal motor control of
      the upper hemiparesis limb, between 4 and 10 weeks after stroke, of 6 weeks of partial
      substitution of routine care (occupational therapy) by structured movement repetition
      programs by Intensive Visual Simulation using an IVS3 device, compared to 6 weeks of a
      program involving only conventional rehabilitation care, in a population of moderate to
      severe hemiparesis stroke patients in subacute phase.

      Device Description: The IVS3 (Intensive Visual Simulation) rehabilitation device, marketed by
      Dessintey, allows the implementation of intensive mirror therapy by making it more immersive,
      ergonomic, and accessible. The IVS3 device consists of a hollow table adjustable in height, a
      touch screen dedicated to the therapist to set up the device and a large screen adjustable in
      height and sliding laterally to overlap the upper limb and thus allow the illusion that the
      limb visible on the screen is the paretic upper limb.

      Methods: Multicentric randomised controlled Trial.

      Risk/Constraint: To our knowledge, this research does not involve any risks other than those
      of daily life. The medical device will be used under normal conditions of use as described in
      the user manual. No contraindications are specified for this device. A risk of discomfort may
      be felt by the patient during the first few minutes of use. Possibility of feeling tired.

      Research duration : 3 years Duration of patient participation : 18 weeks

Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the Range Of Movement (ROM)

Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult

    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a 59 item patient reported outcome measure, covering 8 domains: strength (4 items), hand function (5 items), mobility (9 items), activities of daily living (10 items), memory (7 items), communication (7 items), emotion (9 items), and handicap (8 items). Domains are scored on a metric of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better self-reported health. Four of the scales of the SIS can be combined into a composite physical domain (strength, hand function, physical and instrumental activities of daily living, and mobility), with scores also presented on a 0 to 100 metric.</description>
