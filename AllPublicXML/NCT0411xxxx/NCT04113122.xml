  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin-combination chemotherapy causes inevitably DNA damage by platinum-DNA adduct
      formation of both tumor cells but also healthy cells. It therefore stands to reason that
      testicular cancer treatment causes an increased burden of senescent cells, which causes
      upregulation of the SASP resulting in a pro-inflammatory phenotype. The investigators
      hypothesize that this may be an important mechanism behind development of late effects and an
      early ageing phenotype after treatment for testicular cancer.

    <intervention_model_description>A study will be performed consisting of two cohorts. Cross-sectional study Testicular cancer survivors treated between 2000 and 2005 or between 2006 and 2012 with cisplatin-combination chemotherapy and were extensively phenotypically mapped within two longitudinal trials will be invited to participate in a single cross-sectional follow-up study visit 5-20 years after chemotherapy.
Longitudinal study
Patients with metastasized testicular cancer who are about to start with cisplatin-combination chemotherapy will be invited. Study participation involves four study visits:
Visit 1: before start of chemotherapy Visit 2: before third cycle of chemotherapy Visit 3: one month after completion of chemotherapy Visit 4: one year after start of chemotherapy
Patients with stage I testicular cancer will serve as control group with three study visits:
Visit 1: at time of orchidectomy Visit 2: one month after orchidectomy Visit 3: one year after orchidectomy</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A 4 mm skin biopsy will be performed at the upper leg of the patient. Before the skin biopsy local anesthesia is applied subcutaneously. In these skin biopsies senescent cells will be detected by p16, p21 and yH2Ax staining. Furthermore, we will measure platinum levels in the skin biopsies.</description>

    <description>An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy will be performed 7-10 cm on the right side of the umbilicus. Before the fat biopsy local anesthesia is applied subcutaneously. An amount of 30 mg fat tissue will be collected using needle aspiration.
In these fat biopsies senescent cells will be detected by p16, p21 and yH2Ax staining. Furthermore, we will measure platinum levels (ICP-MS), adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6, PAI-1, TNF-Î±), p53 activation indirectly by measuring p21 or mdm2 expression using immunohistochemistry, microRNA regulation of insulin signaling in adipose tissue: miR-103, miR-107, miR-29.</description>
