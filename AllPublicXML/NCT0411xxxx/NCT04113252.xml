  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are commonly prescribed pain medications, but they can lead to addiction. The study
      team is trying to determine if providing someone with an incentive (money in the form of a
      Visa gift card) to use less pain medications will result in study participants actually using
      fewer pain tablets than allowed by their health care provider. The study team also wants to
      know if providing the incentive (the Visa gift card alone) works the same as the incentive
      (the Visa gift card) plus providing additional information about addiction and alternative
      pain management.

      Study participants will receive the standard of care for pain management at discharge. If
      study participants were not hospitalized at discharge, the study team will begin that
      standard of pain management at the participant's first outpatient clinic visit. Study
      participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups. All groups will receive a gift card if
      participants return the completed medication diary to the study team.

        -  Group 1 will complete a medication diary. Also, group 1 will be encouraged to return any
           unused tablets to the study clinic.

        -  Group 2 will be asked to complete a medication diary. Group 2 will also have a 50/50
           chance of receiving money for each unused opioid tablet returned to the study clinic.

        -  Group 3 will be the same as group 2 except in addition, they will be given a coaching
           session about the use of pain medication and a simple way that may help participants use
           less opioid pain medication.
