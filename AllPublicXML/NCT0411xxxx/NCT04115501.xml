  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observer blinded, central randomization controlled, multi-center
      clinical trial to assess the relationship between intraoperative FiO2 and postoperative
      pulmonary complications with lung injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperoxia is common in cardiac surgery and is easy to prevent by adjusting FiO2. Since there
      is no prospective study on different FiO2 and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs)
      during cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that hyperoxia during cardiac surgery could lead to
      higher incidence of lung injury and PPCs than normoxia. The objective of this trial is to
      compare postoperative PPCs and other outcomes between hyperoxia and normoxia strategy by
      PaO2/FiO2 in CABG patients.

    <description>The restrictive oxygen patients' Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) will be set at a minimum of 0.3 to maintain their oxygen saturations (SpO2) greater than or equal to 95% intraoperatively. During CPB a blended air/oxygen mixture will be titrated to arterial blood gas analysis with aim of maintenance of PaO2 between 100 and 150 mmHg. After transfer to ICU, all patients' FiO2 will be set to 50% initially, and titrate to minimal FiO2 (not less than 21%) for maintain SPO2≥95% until extubation.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Liberal Oxygen</arm_group_label>

    <description>The liberal oxygen group will consist of subjects exposed to a Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) set at 1.0 throughout the intraoperative period, including during cardiopulmonary bypass. After transfer to ICU, all patients' FiO2 will be set to 50% initially, and titrate to minimal FiO2 (not less than 21%) for maintain SPO2≥95% until extubation.</description>
