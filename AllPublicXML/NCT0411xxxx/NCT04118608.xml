  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome characterized by breakdown of
      skeletal muscle, and leakage of intracellular substances such as myoglobin and creatine
      kinase (CK) into the circulation. The aetiological spectrum of rhabdomyolysis is extensive,
      and the clinical spectrum varies from a transient subclinical increase in CK activity to
      acute kidney injury (AKI) as a serious complication. There are no large prospective studies
      and only a few retrospective studies on rhabdomyolysis.

      Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome characterized by breakdown of
      skeletal muscle, and leakage of intracellular substances such as myoglobin and creatine
      kinase (CK) into the circulation. The aetiological spectrum of rhabdomyolysis is extensive,
      and the clinical spectrum varies from a transient subclinical increase in CK activity to
      acute kidney injury (AKI) as a serious complication. There are no large prospective studies
      and only a few retrospective studies on rhabdomyolysis.

      The project will give much needed information about incidence, aetiologies and the clinical
      course of rhabdomyolysis. The main objective will be to study rhabdomyolysis with focus on
      the development of AKI and how laboratory values can guide treatment, and thus act as basis
      for guidelines. More knowledge is needed about rhabdomyolysis and long-term kidney injury,
      and the study will aim to identify a risk population for later kidney injury, thus being able
      to refer this group to follow-up and prevent further injury. On the other hand,
      exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis patients are probably hospitalized more than necessary these
      days, and over-treatment could be prevented if better guidelines were obtained. The possible
      cardiotoxicity of myoglobin needs further study, and would benefit the patient group but also
      fill a knowledge gap for the clinicians. Therefore, this project will ideally obtain new
      knowledge for the health services, potentially improve existing practice and fill important
      knowledge gaps.

        1. Main study:

               -  Inclusion Criteria: Patients age 18 years and older, with a muscle injury
                  developed before hospitalization and serum CK activity ≥5000 U/L and/or serum
                  myoglobin concentrations ≥1000 ng/ml within 72 hours after admission will be
                  included.

               -  Exclusion Criteria: Patients with unknown identity will be excluded.

          2. Sub-study on outcome after AKI:

               -  Inclusion Criteria: Patients with kreatinin above reference/eGFR under

                  albumin/creatinine ratio above normal limit) at discharge will be included in the
                  outcome study.

               -  Exclusion Criteria: Patients with chronic kidney failure but no deterioration in

                  security number will be excluded.

               -  Inclusion Criteria: All patients with troponins over 14 ng/L and who otherwise
                  fulfills the inclusion criteria can be included.

               -  Exclusion Criteria: Acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, arrythmia, previous
                  myocarditis, circulatory shock, acute pulmonary embolism, thoracic trauma/heart
                  trauma or CKD before hospitalization.
