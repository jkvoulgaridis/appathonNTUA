  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with lower extremity lymphedema will be prescribed, per standard of care, to either
      Flexitouch Plus with conservative care or conservative care only and be followed for 12
      months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conservative care treatment for lymphedema may include use of compression, manual lymphatic
      drainage (MLD, performed either by a therapist or self-MLD), exercises and skin care.
      Subjects presenting to a vein clinic (Center for Vein Restoration or CVR) with lymphedema of
      the lower extremity/ies may receive a standard-of-care prescription for conservative care or
      for the Flexitouch Plus pneumatic compression device along with conservative care. Subjects
      will be followed (by phone and in clinic) for 12 months after initiating treatment for
      venous- and lymphedema-related complications, unscheduled visits, changes in quality of life
      measures and edema measures, skin changes, and changes to wounds (if present).

    <measure>Quality of life changes: Short-Form 12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Flexitouch Plus and conservative care, compared to conservative care alone, in vascular patients with lower extremity lymphedema after 6 months of treatment based upon changes in the SF-12. This survey includes 12 questions to measure physical and mental health from the patient's point of view. The questionnaire includes eight health domains: physical functioning, physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional health problems, and mental health. The scoring mechanism uses T scores for all surveys using means and standard deviations from the 1998 US general population. A higher score represents better function.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life changes: Quality of Life with Venous Insufficiency (CIVIQ-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Flexitouch Plus and conservative care, compared to conservative care alone, in vascular patients with lower extremity lymphedema after 6 months of treatment based upon changes in the CIVIQ-20, which is a survey specific to assess patient-perceived quality of life with chronic venous disorders. The instrument reviews four dimensions - psychological (range 9-45), pain (range 4-20), physical (range 4-20), and social (range 3-15). A global index score can be obtained by adding up the scores of all 20 items (range 20-100). A low score corresponds to greater patient comfort.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Flexitouch Plus and conservative care, compared to conservative care alone, in vascular patients with lower extremity lymphedema after 6 months of treatment based upon changes in the LYMQOL, used to assess lymphedema symptom changes. LYMQOL includes sub-scores for function (range 8-32), appearance (range 7-28), symptoms (range 5-20), and mood (range 6-24) where lower scores represent a better outcome. It also includes an overall QOL sub-score (range 0-10) where a higher score represents a better outcome.</description>
