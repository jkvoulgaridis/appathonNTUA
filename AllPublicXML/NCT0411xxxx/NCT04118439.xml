  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention with observed actions and motor
      imagery, through self-treatment at home, in the improvement of perceived disability, pain
      intensity and quality of life in patients with chronic painful shoulder (CPS). Design:
      multicenter randomized controlled trial of parallel groups, single blind controlled, carried
      out in the Community of Madrid. Population: patients between 18-65 years of age with CPS who
      come to physical therapy consultation at the Primary Health Centers of the Community of
      Madrid. N = 66 (33 in each branch). Control group: usual practice standardized in the Primary
      Heal Physical Therapy Services Community of Madrid. Experimental group: intervention with
      observed actions and motor imagery, which will perform in a graduated way the patient in his
      home through the application MIRROR THERAPY VR, in addition to the usual practice. Variable
      main result: Intensity of Pain. Secondary variables: sociodemographic, sensorimotor, quality
      of motor imagery, psychosocial (perceived disability, catastrophism, kinesiophobia, Anxiety /
      depression) and quality of life. Analysis: by intention to treat, comparing the Pain
      Intensity score before / after the intervention in both groups at 1 and 3 months of
      intervention.
