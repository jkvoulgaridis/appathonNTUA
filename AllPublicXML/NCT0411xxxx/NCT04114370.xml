  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the ability of [F-18]fluciclovine to differentiate
      pseudoprogression from progression in participants after therapy, at imaging time points
      within the 12 week interval post chemoradiation. [F-18]fluciclovine. PET will be obtained at
      the time point in the 12 week interval in which MRI demonstrates increase in enhancing volume
      with the differential diagnosis of pseudoprogression versus tumor progression. At the same
      time point (at least 6 hours after [F-18]fluciclovine or up to 3 days) F-18 FDG will also be
      performed consistent with standard clinical practice. The verification of pseudoprogression
      versus tumor progression will be determined by the regression of enhancing lesion on
      subsequent MRI imaging obtained as part of standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the investigators propose to image 10 participants who have been
      previously diagnosed by resection or biopsy with grade 3 or 4 glioma.

      All glioma cases undergoing resection at UPMC are evaluated by immunohistochemistry for
      mutations in p53, nuclear localization of ATRX, and the presence of IDH1R132H mutation as
      part of standard neuropathologic integrated diagnosis using the WHO 2016 diagnostic criteria.
      All glioma cases resected at UPMC undergo genetic profiling using next generation sequencing.

      MRI imaging will be obtained as part of standard clinical care. The MRI sequences include T1
      pre and post contrast, T2 FLAIR, DWI, ADC and perfusion sequences using the imaging algorithm
      for evaluating treatment response in glioma treatment trials. Radiogenomic analysis will be
      performed using the MRI imaging sequences obtained as standard clinical care.

    <measure>To assess the ability of [F-18]fluciclovine to differentiate radionecrosis (pseudoprogression) from tumor recurrence (progression) in patients after therapy, at imaging time points within the 12 week interval post chemoradiation.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the ability of [F-18]fluciclovine to differentiate pseudoprogression from progression as compared to F-18 FDG, regions of interest will be drawn around MRI anatomically defined enhancing tumor regions and translated to both the F-18 FDG and F-18 fluciclovine PET scans to obtain SUV for each tracer. The SUV values will be correlated with the diagnosis of pseudoprogression versus tumor progression as determined by the regression of lesion enhancement on subsequent standard clinical follow up MRI imaging, as described in the protocol.</description>

    <description>Prior to beginning PET imaging, 18F-fluciclovine will be administered as an intravenous bolus injection followed by a 10mL saline flush. 18F-fluciclovine will be injected through a cannula (or indwelling catheter) in an antecubital vein or another vein that will provide access. The administration site will be evaluated pre- and post-administration for any reaction. Documentation of administration to a participant will be recorded or as part of the scan upload, including date, prescription number, dose activity (as measured at time of administration), total volume, and start/stop time of administration.</description>
