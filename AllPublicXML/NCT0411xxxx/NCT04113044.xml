  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective data will be collected in approximately 3500 patients (700 per 5 injury groups).

      Patients will be followed up according to the standard (routine) for up to 1 year after the
      treatment.

      Data collection will include underlying disease, treatment details, patient reported outcomes
      (PROs), anticipated or procedure-related adverse events (i.e. complications), and
      radiological outcomes.

      More in detail this observational study includes the following sub-projects:

      I) Weight -bearing and Gait Observation for Fully Individualized Treatment and Aftercare
      Following Surgery and Trauma

      Objectives:

      To analyse the association between automated, sensor-based patient activity and loading data,
      and clinical (Patient Reported Outcomes [PROs]) and radiographic outcome during fracture
      healing.

      II) Recovery Trajectory using PROMIS®: Defining the Recovery Trajectory using PROMIS® to
      Optimize Decision-making and Outcomes following Extremity Fractures

      Objectives:

        1. To identify the factors predictive of longer term magnitude of limitations after
           extremity fractures (using PROMs)

        2. To assess minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical
           benefit (SCB) in PROM scores

        3. To define recovery trajectories of PROMs i.e. range, normative limits and score
           thresholds

      III) Linking PROMIS®: Linking of PROMIS Measures to Legacy Measures in an Orthopaedic Patient
      Population

      Objectives:

        1. Administer and collect responses to the PROMIS PF/UE and PAIN INT and the four
           orthopaedic legacy measures in the same group of orthopaedic trauma patients.

        2. Apply the methods of item-response theory (IRT) linking to establish a common
           standardized metric.

        3. Develop equations for conversion of a PROMIS PF/UE and PAIN INT score to each of the
           specified legacy measures and vice-versa.

    <measure>Patient Activation Measure (PAM)-10</measure>
    <time_frame>from the treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>PAM-10 assesses activation and the personal and psychological competencies. PAM segments individuals into one of four activation levels along an empirically derived 100-point scale.

    <description>The MiniCog is a 3-minute instrument assessing cognitive impairment. It consists of two components, a 3-item recall test for memory and a simply scored clock drawing test. A total score ranges from 0 to 5. A score of zero, one or two out of five points in total, indicates a concern in cognitive functioning.</description>
