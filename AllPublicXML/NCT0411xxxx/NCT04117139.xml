      This study investigates the diagnostic value of PET/MRI for cervical lymph node metastases
      from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Danish fast-track cancer program standardizes the work-up of patients suspected of head
      and neck cancer. Currently, the guidelines recommend head and neck magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) as the standard imaging modality for assessment of the primary tumor site and potential
      nodal metastases. However, recent studies have shown advantages in the use of 18F-FDG-PET
      (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) due to its superiority in detecting metastases
      and synchronous cancers.

      During the last couple of years PET/MRI has been introduced. MRI is known to provide the
      highest anatomic detail in the head and neck region, and preliminary studies show promising
      results. However, the evidence is still very sparse.

      The purpose of the project is to investigate the diagnostic value of PET/MRI in patients with
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The hypothesis is that PET/MRI provides a more precise
      diagnosis of regional lymph node metastases, and thus, make the surgical treatment of the
      neck more accurate and less invasive resulting in reduced morbidity.

      The project is designed as a prospective cohort study based on paired data with head-to-head
      comparison of CT, MRI, PET/CT and PET/MRI. Patients will be included from the head and neck
      cancer fast-track program at the Center of Head and Neck Cancer, Odense University Hospital
      (OUH).

      Included patients will be offered PET/MRI in addition to the conventional fast-track imaging.
      The description of the images will be made blinded. When a neck dissection of the lymph nodes
      is made, the lymph nodes will be separated in defined regions. The diagnostic accuracy of the
      individual imaging modalities is assessed for each neck level with histology as standard
      reference.
