  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain reduction effects of the median nerve neural mobilization technique (a physiotherapy
      treatment) will be compared to those produced by a pharmaceutical treatment and the absence
      of treatment, in subjects who suffer carpal tunnel syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized clinical trial will perform a comparison of the pain reduction effects
      produced by the application of median nerve neural mobilization (non invasive and non
      pharmaceutical physiotherapy treatment), to the pain reduction effect produced by an oral
      ibuprofen treatment or the lack of treatment (waiting list control group) in subjects
      diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, effects over the functionality of the
      affected upper limb will be evaluated and compared. Subjects will be invited to participate
      and randomly allocated to 3 different groups.

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline (measured immediately before the application of each treatment) at 40 minutes after the application of treatment. Measures at baseline and after treatment will be performed 3 days a week during 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed through the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a psychometric response scale. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.The VAS is the most frequently used method to assess pain intensity. The scale will be displayed as a horizontal 10-cm line labelled at each end by descriptors such as 'no pain' (the minimum and best outcome possible) and 'worse pain ever' (maximum and worst outcome possible). The participant will mark the line to indicate pain severity and it is simply quantified by measuring the distance in centimeters from 0 (no pain) to the patient's marked rating.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limb function</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline (measured immediately before the application of the first treatment) at 40 minutes after the application of the last treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed through the Quick- Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Quick- DASH) questionary, which is a shortened version of the 30-item Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) instrument. The instrument administered to the participants will be a self-report questionnaire, that will rate the difficulty and interference of daily life on a 5 point Likert scale. At least 10 of the 11 items must be completed for a score to be calculated and the scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>
