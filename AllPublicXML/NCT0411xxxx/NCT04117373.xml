  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) followed by skin reconstruction has been widely accepted for
      treatment of many skin cancers. To further characterize the trends in MMS and reconstruction
      for skin cancer, a retrospective analysis will be performed using the Optum© Clinformatics®
      DataMart de-identified commercial claims database from 2001-2016. The findings may provide
      critical data for future prospective studies in skin cancer treatments.

        The study population was conveniently sampled from the compilation of de-identified claims
        in the Optum© Clinformatics® database using ICD9 and ICD10 codes specific for skin cancer
        and linking them to specific CPT codes for interpolated flap repair, a reconstructive skin
        surgery. The investigator's population is composed of &gt;7,000 patients across the United
        States who received a skin cancer diagnosis and this procedure between 2001 and 2016.
