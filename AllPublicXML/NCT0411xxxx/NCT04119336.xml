    <textblock>

      nivolumab with ixazomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab for relapsed and
           refractory Multiple Myeloma but it has been approved for other uses.

        -  The FDA has approved ixazomib and cyclophosphamide as treatment options for your
           disease.

        -  Nivolumab is a type of antibody (a protein that attaches to other cells to fight off
           infection and disease) that attaches to and inhibits a protein called PD-1.

           -- PD-1 is a checkpoint protein on immune cells called T cells. It normally acts as a
           type of &quot;off switch&quot; that helps keep the T cells from attacking other cells in the body.
           Some cancer cells have large amounts of PD-L1 which binds to PD-1 and turns off the
           immune system. Nivolumab inhibits PD-1 and helps take the &quot;brake&quot; off the immune system.
           The investigators' hope that nivolumab will inhibit the PD-1 protein, thus allowing your
           immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells.

        -  Ixazomib is a type of inhibitor that blocks a protein in your cells called a proteasome.
           This protein is responsible for breaking down other proteins in your cells when they
           need to be disposed of. By blocking the proteasome from working, a buildup of proteins
           will be created in the cancer cells, which may lead to cell death.

        -  The investigators hope that the combination of ixazomib and nivolumab with standard of
           care chemotherapy cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone will work together with ixazomib
           and nivolumab to treat multiple myeloma.
