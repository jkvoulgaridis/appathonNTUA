  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of older adults have hypertension, with higher prevalence of high systolic
      blood pressure (SBP) putting them at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease and death.
      Novel compound, nicotinamide riboside may enhance the effects of exercise therapy in
      hypertensive older adults.

    <description>SBP will be measured every 20 minutes (min) during the day (from 0700 to 2200 hours), and every 60 min overnight (from 2200 to 0700 hours).</description>

    <measure>Change in arterial stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 3; Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV), commonly measured as carotid to femoral PWV (cfPWV), will be measured using the SphygmoCor XCEL system. Briefly, cfPWV will be determined by recording pressure pulse waves at the carotid and femoral arteries using a high-fidelity micromanometer and calculating the distance between the recording sites divided by the time delay between the carotid and the femoral pulse waves.</description>
