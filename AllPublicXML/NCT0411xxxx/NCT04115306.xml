  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of PMD-026 in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer. PMD-026 is a targeted oral agent
      designed to kill tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of PMD-026 using an accelerated
      titration design to define the MTD in metastatic breast cancer, followed by an expansion at
      the RP2D in triple negative breast cancer. All patients will receive daily oral doses of
      PMD-026 until either disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will have disease
      assessments initially after 6 weeks of treatment, and every 9 weeks thereafter.

      Patients enrolled to the Dose Escalation Phase must have histologically or cytologically
      diagnosed metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on or after standard of care therapy.
      Patients enrolled to the Dose Expansion Phase must have histologically or cytologically
      diagnosed metastatic triple negative breast cancer that has progressed on or after standard
      of care therapy. All patients must provide tumor tissue (archival preferred) prior to study
      entry.

      PMD-026 is an oral, reversible small molecule inhibitor of RSK1-4 with high selectivity for
      RSK2. High levels of RSK2 expression have been associated with worse overall survival in
      breast cancer. Inhibiting RSK2 may inhibit growth of breast cancer.
