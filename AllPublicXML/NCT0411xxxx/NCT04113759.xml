  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of
      patients undergoing primary hip arthroscopy for FAIS and/or labral pathology. All patients
      who sign the consent form will be enrolled in the study and randomized to one of the two
      treatment arms. Follow-up will take place at 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, and 1-year.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose using standardized strength testing, serial quadriceps
      measurements, and MRI to assess the efficacy of BFR training in increasing muscle hypertrophy
      following hip arthroscopy. Investigators will perform a randomized double-blinded
      placebo-controlled controlled trial of patients undergoing primary hip arthroscopy.
      Quadriceps strength will be measured with dynamometers at 3, 6, and 12 month time points,
      with Biodex strength testing at 6 and 12 months, postoperatively. Additionally, standardized
      circumferential leg measurements to assess quadriceps hypertrophy will be performed at 1, 3,
      6 and 12-month time points. Patients will also undergo a hip MRI at 6 months postoperatively
      to quantify muscle size and appearance about the hip joint. Patient reported outcomes
      including standard outcomes measures at 3, 6, and 12 months and return to work/sport data
      will also be collected at standard time points. Patients will also be followed longitudinally
      for rates of reinjury, return to work, and return to sport.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of BFR therapy in the postoperative period of primary
      hip arthroscopy to improve muscle hypertrophy during the short-term rehabilitation period.
      This will be directly measured by strength testing with dynamometers and Biodex testing.
      Other metrics will include standard validated patient reported outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 month
      time points including hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS), Harris Hip
      score (HHS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, international hip outcome tool (iHOT-12),
      and Hip outcome score (HOS), and return to sport questionnaires. Standardized serial
      circumferential thigh measurements will also be recorded at each visit, in additional to a
      one time MRI at 6 months postoperatively.
