      Sjogren's syndrome.

    <textblock>
      This is 2 years' double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients
      fulfilled the classification criteria of Sjogren syndrome will be recruited. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized on a 2:1 ratio to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) granules or
      placebo for 12 weeks. The treatment group will receive a combination formula with traditional
      Chinese medicine, Gan-Lu-Yin in the morning and Jia-wei-Xiao-yao-San in the evening. Primary
      endpoint is the ESSPRI, European Sjogren Syndrome Patient Reported Outcome Index. Secondary
      endpoints include disease activity index (ESSDAI) , patient global assessment (PGA), VAS pain
      scale, Quality of Life by Short Form-36 (SF-36), fatigue scale and related serological
      markers. Thirty patients will be enrolled in the first year. After interim analysis at the
      end of first year, sample size will be recalculated base on the interim analysis results.
