  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure is one of the most common diagnosis in patients admitted in the
      Emergency Department. Acute respiratory failure is associated with morbidity and mortality.
      Fifteen percent of patient will require ventilatory support and among them 40% will die.

      Measurement of diaphragmatic motion (excursion) at ultrasonography is a noninvasive measure,
      allowing to assess diaphragm dysfunction. It could be useful in predicting poor prognosis in
      ED patients with respiratory failure .

      In this study the investigators will compare the prognostic value of diaphragmatic excursion
      measurement at ultrasonography to that of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 in
      patients presenting with acute respiratory failure in the ED

      The Investigators made the hypothesis that measurement of diaphragmatic excursion in ED
      patients with acute respiratory failure could be of value in predicting the need for
      ventilatory support or mortality within 28 days from ED admission

      Diaphragmatic dysfunction can be explored by measuring diaphragmatic excursion using
      ultrasonography in spontaneous ventilation patients.

      Patients in spontaneous ventilation will undergo both diaphragmatic excursion measurement at
      ultrasonography and assessment of the News2 score as part of standard care.
