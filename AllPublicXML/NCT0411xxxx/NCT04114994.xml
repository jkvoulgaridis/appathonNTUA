      The Boston Cognitive Assessment (BoCA) is a self-administered online test intended for
      longitudinal cognitive monitoring. BoCA uses random not-repeating tasks to minimize learning
      effects. BoCA was developed to evaluate the effects of treatment in longitudinal clinical
      trials and available gratis to individuals and professionals.

      The Boston Cognitive Assessment (BoCA) is a self-administered online test intended for
      longitudinal cognitive monitoring. BoCA uses random not- repeating tasks to minimize learning
      effects. BoCA was developed to evaluate the effects of treatment in longitudinal clinical
      trials and available gratis to individuals and professionals.

      BoCA includes eight subtests in the following domains: Memory/Immediate Recall,
      Memory/Delayed Recall, Executive function/ Visuospatial, Executive function/ Mental rotation,
      Attention, Mental math, Language/Prefrontal Synthesis, and Orientation. The maximum total
      score is 30. Higher score indicates better cognitive performance.

      After BoCA is completed, the domain scores and total score are provided immediately. Users
      will also receive an email with the link to the full report with progress charts.

      The BoCA evaluation can help doctors figure out if an underlying condition is causing a
      patient's cognitive decline. Many treatable conditions such as sleep disorders, mood
      problems, heavy metal accumulation, as well as lack of movement and social interactions can
      affect memory and thinking.

      Our goal is to reduce barriers for patients to receive the testing that may benefit their
      treatment and health through the use of digital technology.

        According to the American Academy of Neurology, nearly 7% of people in their early 60s
        worldwide have mild cognitive impairment, while the condition affects 38% of people ages 85
        and older.

        The BoCA evaluation can help doctors figure out if an underlying condition is causing a
        patient's cognitive decline. Many treatable conditions such as sleep disorders, mood
        problems, heavy metal accumulation, as well as lack of movement and social interactions can
        affect memory and thinking.
