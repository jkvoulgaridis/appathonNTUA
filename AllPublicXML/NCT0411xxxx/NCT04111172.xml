  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-finding, single-center, study of Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE vaccine
      delivered intramuscularly in subjects with colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal
      cancers who are at high risk of relapse without evidence of disease post definitive surgery
      and standard therapy.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria can participate in this study at least four and no
      more than 24 weeks ± one week post-completion of standard treatment, after they have
      recovered from the side effects from previous therapies. Eligible subjects will be
      simultaneously randomized into three treatment arms of 10^11, 10^12, or 5x10^12 vp
      Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE administered by IM injection once every four weeks (± one week) for a
      total of three administrations. An initial safety group of 9 subjects (3 in each group) will
      be randomized and further enrollment will be paused until they have completed 4 weeks of
      follow-up to ensure no dose-limiting toxicities.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE, delivered
      intramuscularly three times at three dose levels in subjects with high-risk colorectal,
      pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal adenocarcinomas with no evidence of disease (NED) after
      surgery and standard therapy

      II. Evaluate the cellular (T-cell) responses to Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at three different dose
      levels (10^11, 10^12, and 5x10^12 vp) administered intramuscularly three times, four weeks
      apart in subjects with high-risk colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, or esophageal cancer with
      NED after surgery and standard therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the humoral immunologic response to GCC, defined as an incremental or sustained
      antibody (pan-Ig) response, measured at Weeks 5, 9, and 13 following the first vaccination
      (Week 1).

      II. Evaluate the relationship between immunological responses to GCC and 1) neutralizing
      antibodies to Ad5 and Ad5.F35 and 2) GCC protein expression in tumors to assess immune
      tolerance.

      III. Evaluate DFS and OS, where feasible.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms. A safety cohort of 3 patients per arm (9
      total) will be enrolled first. If determined safe to continue, additional patients will be
      enrolled.

      ARM I: After completion of definitive surgery and standard therapy, Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at
      10^11vp Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, and 9

      ARM II: After completion of definitive surgery and standard therapy, Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at
      10^12vp Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, and 9

      ARM III: After completion of definitive surgery and standard therapy, Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE at
      5x10^12vp Day 1 of Weeks 1, 5, and 9

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 24 months.

             margins and biochemical markers are permitted. Therapy must have been completed no
             fewer than four weeks, and no later than 25 weeks, before the first dose of
             Ad5.F35-hGCC-PADRE

          7. For women and men of childbearing potential, a medically acceptable method of highly
             effective contraception (oral hormonal contraceptive, condom plus spermicide, or
             hormonal implants) or abstinence must be used throughout the study period and for 28
             days after their final vaccine administration (A barrier method of contraception must
             be employed by all subjects [male and female], regardless of other methods unless
             abstinent). A negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required as part of screening.

             Women of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has experienced menarche
             and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12
             months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or
             physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented
