    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the pressure pain threshold, shoulder biomechanics, cardiorespiratory
      function and the quality of life associated with the short and long-term physical therapy
      rehabilitation following breast cancer surgery. Methodology: The study presents three
      objectives and involves three groups of participants. Objective 1 is to develop a topographic
      map of pressure pain in the shoulder (using a digital pressure algometer), evaluate the
      biomechanics of the shoulder (using a digital inclinometer and load card), cardiorespiratory
      function (through frequency variability resting heart rate and distance traveled, through the
      six-minute walk test) and quality of life (through questionnaires of quality of life,
      anxiety, depression, sleep quality, upper limb functionality, fatigue and level of physical
      activity) between a group of women prior to the operation of breast cancer (experimental
      group, n = 36) and a group of asymptomatic controls for shoulder pain (control group, n =
      18). Objective 2 is to evaluate the possible changes in the pain map over 24 weeks of
      supervised kinetic intervention (Supervised Physiotherapy experimental group, n = 18, will
      begin after drainage, frequency 3 times per week and duration of 60 minutes each session)
      compared to unsupervised kinetic intervention (Home Physiotherapy experimental group, n = 18,
      participants will receive an exercise booklet). Objective 3 is to evaluate the biomechanics
      of the shoulder, cardiorespiratory function and the quality of life with respect to the
      experimental group with and without kinesic supervision. To achieve objective 1, two baseline
      evaluations will be carried out in both experimental and control groups (considering the
      month prior to the surgery of the experimental group) and the average of the evaluations will
      be considered evaluation 1. To achieve objectives 2 and 3, evaluation 2 (after 4 weeks of
      intervention), 3 (after 12 weeks of intervention) and 4 (after 24 weeks of intervention) will
      be performed. The statistical analysis will include the examination of qualitative and
      quantitative variables. Statistical tests will be applied according to the normality of the
      data and a significance level of 5% will be adopted for all comparisons. Expected results: It
      is expected to identify sensory, biomechanical, cardiorespiratory and quality of life
      alterations in the experimental group, compared to the control group. In addition, after 24
      weeks of intervention, the supervised experimental group will show improvement in all the
      aforementioned variables with respect to the unsupervised group.
