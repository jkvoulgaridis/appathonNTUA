  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential correlations of global longitudinal
      strain and peak left atrial strain, measured by speckle tracking echocardiography with the
      severity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the risk for arrhythmias.

      Specifically the investigational questions are:

        1. Is there a correlation between myocardial deformation parameters of the left heart
           chambers with other important ultrasound parameters (eg maximal wall thickness, presence
           of subaortic obstruction, etc.) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

        2. Is there a correlation between myocardial deformation parameters of the left heart
           chambers and the symptomatology or functional capacity of patients with hypertrophic
           cardiomyopathy?

        3. Is there a correlation between the myocardial deformation parameters of the left heart
           chambers and the exercise capacity, as evidenced by the cardiopulmonary exercise test,
           in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

        4. Is there a correlation between myocardial deformation parameters of the left heart
           chambers with the risk of ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias in patients with
           hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

        5. Is there a correlation between myocardial deformation parameters of the left heart
           chambers and risk factors for sudden death?

      Myocardial deformation parameters of the left heart chambers are of particular clinical
      importance because of their possible association with the severity of HCM and the presence of
      arrhythmias. However,current literature appears conflicting.

      This is a prospective cohort study aiming to examine the echocardiographic parameters of
      myocardial deformation, estimated by the &quot;speckle tracking&quot; method, and their correlation
      with clinical presentation and symptomatology, other imaging parameters, exercise capacity,
      arrhythmias (ventricular or supraventricular) and risk factors for sudden death in patients
      with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

      Although, similar efforts have been made in international literature, they are scarce and
      their results contradictory. The present study is the first to be performed in a Greek
      population, a fact that is particularly important given the genetic heterogeneity of the
      disease.
