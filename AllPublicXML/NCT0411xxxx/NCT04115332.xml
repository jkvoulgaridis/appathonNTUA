  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators provide biofeedback training to assist the abused PW nurses to reduce
      WPV-related stress and achieve better resilience and mental health. The research project will
      assess the participants' physiological indices prior to the intervention as well as their
      levels of resilience and mental status.

    <textblock>
      This was a quasi-experimental study, structured questionnaires of Resilience Score, The
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) and Occupational Stress Indicator-2 were
      used in this study before and three months after intervention. A total of 112 abused
      psychiatric nurses were randomly assigned to 3 groups. The biofeedback group (n=40) received
      the biofeedback training and the self-training group received video relaxation training by
      Line (n=44). The control group (n=28) did not receive any intervention.

      Biofeedback training is an effective intervention to enhance abused PW nurses' resilience and
      lower their depressive symptoms. Video relaxation self-training is also an effective way to
      strengthen abused psychiatric nurses' resilience.

    <description>The Chinese version Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression was developed with a Cronbach's alpha of 0_86, and it was used as the screening measure of depressive tendency in this study. The cut-off point of the scale is of greater than or equal to 15 on the CES-D score.</description>

    <measure>The Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Resilience Scale was developed by Friborg et al. (2006) and the Chinese version was established by Wang and Chen with satisfactory validity and reliability. The 29-item scale measures intrapersonal and interpersonal protective resources that may facilitate an individual's adaptability to and tolerance for stress and adverse life events. The scale comprises five components, including personal strength, social competence, structured style, family cohesion, and social resources. The total scores of the RS range from 29 to 203, with higher scores indicating a higher level of resilience.</description>

    <description>EEG Recording The one-channel EEG sensor was recorded from Cz with linked-ear reference based on the International 10-20 system. EEG signals were recorded using BioGraph Infiniti software (Version 6.0.4, n.d.) with a band-pass between 1-30 Hz. The sample rate was 256 Hz with 60-Hz notch filters, and the electrode impedances were lower than 5 kΩ.
A lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected for 5 minutes at baseline using the ProComp InfinitiTM system (Thought Technology Ltd., Montreal, Canada), which was installed on a laptop. A sampling rate of 2,048/second was set in order to acquire real-time interbeat intervals.</description>
