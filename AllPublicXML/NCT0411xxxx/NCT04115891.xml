  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of lavender oil (Lavandula
      angustifolia) on anxiety, pain and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and saturation)
      among children planned to undergone surgical intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lavender oil has sedative properties. Dental anxiety is one of the most common obstacles to
      dental care, especially for children ranges from 3% to 43% in different populations. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the use of lavender oil
      inhalation and to assess the correlation of anxiety and vital signs among children during a
      stressful surgical dental intervention. This study design was constructed according to the
      vital sign evaluations, anxiety and pain scores. Primary hypothesis was that of lavender oil
      inhalation prior to surgical dental interventions would affect vital signs and consequently
      reduce anxiety and perception of pain in children.

    <measure>Anxiety Scale - Face Image Scale (FIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Five cartoon faces symbolized different emotions from very happy to very unhappy. The children chose one face at which they feel most like at that moment. One point is given to most positive face and 5 point is given to most negative face.</description>

    <measure>Pain Scale 1 - Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>FLACC has five categories of behavior to rate pain as follows; facial expression, leg movement, activity, cry and consolability. The scores of each category are between 0 and 2. The total scores can change from 0 to 10 defined as mild (1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe (7-10).</description>

    <measure>Pain Scale 2 - Wong Baker Pain Rating Scales (WBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>WBS combines pictures and numbers to rate pain. The scale has six faces assigned numerical ratings from 0 'no hurt' to 10 'hurts worst'. Administration of WBS is easy, not time consuming and requires minimal instructions</description>
