  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, prospective, exploratory, descriptive, open label, parallel
      group, post-authorization study designed to describe and evaluate two aflibercept treatment
      regimens aimed at achieving and maintaining a maximum visual function benefit (i.e., BCVA
      stability). The goal of the study is to compare two strategies for dosing regimen with
      aflibercept in wet AMD: the standard regimen (one injection every 8 weeks after 3 monthly
      loading doses in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration) versus the treat and
      extend protocol (details outlined below in the &quot;Study Design&quot; section) aiming at achieving
      and maintaining maximum visual acuity benefit while minimizing the number of injections.
      Patients will be randomized at week 8 (Month 2) in a proportion of 1:2 (Standard treatment :
      treat and extend treatment). We aim to demonstrate that the Treat and Extend regimen is
      equivalent or better to the standard fixed interval regimen in terms of change in patients'
      visual acuity after a year of treatment and that patients in the Treat and Extend arm will
      receive fewer injections and fewer visits, than their counterparts in the standard regimen
      arm. The results could be used to generate a base for future controlled-randomized clinical
      trials on the timing of treatment administration for patients with wAMD.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of treatmenttreatment-naive CNV secondary to AMD in the
             study eye, for which aflibercept treatment hashas been prescribed by the treating
             physician. This includes patients with lesion(s) with less than 50% hemorrhage, less
             that 50% fibrosis, and/or serious pigment epithelial detachment (PED)

          -  Patients with best corrected visual acuity score in the study eye between 78 and 19
             letters inclusively, using ETDRS visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of
             4 meters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/32 to 20/400 at screening)
