    <textblock>
      Anlotibib (AL3818) is a kind of innovative medicines approved by State Food and Drug
      Administration（SFDA:2011L00661） which was researched by Jiangsu Chia-tai Tianqing
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with
      multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2、VEGFR3、PDGFRβ and c-Kit. It has the obvious resistance
      to new angiogenesis. The trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential anlotinib
      followed by EP regimen plus concurrent radiotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer(NSCLC).
