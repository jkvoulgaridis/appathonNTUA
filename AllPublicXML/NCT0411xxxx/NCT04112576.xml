    <textblock>
      To characterize the physiological signals collected from a Wearable Cardiac Monitor (WCM)
      prototype device in subjects with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and
      compare against signals from subjects with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction
      (HFrEF).

      To evaluate the relationship of physiological signals measured from a wearable cardiac
      monitor (WCM) prototype device with ECHO measures of systolic and diastolic function
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, feasibility study that will enroll up to 100 participants
      clinically diagnosed with HFpEF or HFrEF. Approximately 70% of participants will have HFpEF
      and 30% will have HFrEF.

      There will be one study visit per participant. The study visit includes device placement and
      data collection during postural changes. Echocardiograms will also be collected throughout
      the study and at least 30% of participants will undergo a submaximal exercise test. The
      device will then be removed.

             heart failure

          -  Documented episode of decompensated heart failure in the past 3 years, which either:
