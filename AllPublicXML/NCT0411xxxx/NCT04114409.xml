  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type D personality is characterized by negative affectivity and social inhibition and is
      assessed with the DS-14 questionnaire. This type of personality was initially described in
      patients with coronary heart disease and associated with poor prognosis and diminished
      quality of life. Whereas the prevalence of type D personality in patients with coronary heart
      disease is between 27% and 31%, the prevalence in the general population is between 13% and
      24%. The prevalence of type D personality in OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome) was only
      investigated in patients with a moderate or severe OSA (Apnea-hypopnea index &gt; 15/hour)
      already on standard clinical treatment with CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure). The
      overall prevalence of type D personality in OSA is still unknown. Furthermore, OSA is
      frequently associated with cardiovascular disease. No studies were performed on the impact of
      type D personality and cardiovascular complications in OSA.

      Until now, only a few studies were performed to investigate type D personality in OSA
      patients treated with CPAP therapy. One retrospective study showed that OSA patients with
      type D personality experienced more side effects of CPAP treatment and were less compliant to
      therapy. In a more recent prospective study, the influence of type D personality on CPAP
      compliance could not be confirmed. No information is available about the frequency of visits
      and the time spent by these patients to remediate CPAP side effects. There is also no data
      about the discontinuation rate of CPAP treatment in this population of patients. It is
      possible that a specific follow up of those patients is needed to enhance CPAP compliance.

      After a while, CPAP therapy can have an influence on mood and behavior. Therefore, it is
      possible that CPAP therapy can alter the patient's answers to the DS-14 questionnaire. This
      could explain the different outcome of the retrospective and prospective studies mentioned
      above. No studies were performed to test the reliability and validate the DS-14 questionnaire
      in OSA patients.

      Consequently, the aim of the present study is to evaluate more extensively the importance of
      type D personality traits in OSA patients.

      Objective of the study

        1. To determine the overall prevalence of type D personality in untreated OSA ( Obstructive
           sleep apnea) patients and their subtypes; mild, moderate, severe and REM (rapid eye
           movement) OSA.

           Full polysomnography and questionnaires:ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2,
           CIS will be used to answer this question.

           A multistage tracking for gender and type D personality was done. In general population,
           there are twice as much men than women suffering from OSA. This means that the
           investigator need to recruit 41% (√ 2 ≈ 1.41%) more men than women. In the general
           population, the prevalence of type D personality is 25%.

           To answer this question, the investigator also assume that there will be 50 % mild, 25%
           moderate and 25% severe OSA.

           Chi- squared test:

           With a power of 0.9: 97 type D patients are needed with a total of 400 patients to be
           recruited.

        2. To establish the reliability and validity of the DS-14 questionnaire to diagnose type D
           personality in OSA patients.

           Full polysomnography and questionnaires:ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2,
           CIS will be used. the DS-14 questionnaire will be filled out one month later.

           An interclass correlation analysis with kappa ≈ 0.8 will give a good correlation between
           the two scores. First, a pilot study will be done on a small sample of patients. In
           function of these results, a sample calculation required to have a significant result
           will be done. In an earlier study, 135 patients with type D personality were studied to
           assess the reproducibility of the DS-14 questionnaire.

        3. To investigate the impact of type D personality on CPAP ( continuous positive airway
           pressure) treatment in OSA patients, especially on compliance for CPAP, on the CPAP
           discontinuation rate and on the frequency and time spent to remediate side effects of
           CPAP treatment.

           Full polysomnography and questionnaires:ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2,
           CIS will be used. The DS-14 questionnaire will be filled out one month later.Titration
           polysomnography 2 months later and questionnaires: ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS,
           HADS, CIS.Consultation 3 month later for control compliance and questionnaires: DS-14,
           SF-36, HADS, FAS, CIS, EES, PSQI.Polyclinic visit 1 year later for control compliance
           and questionnaires: DS-14, SF-36, HADS, FAS, CIS, EES, PSQI.Monitoring time and
           frequency of free consultation for resolving any side effects of the CPAP treatment.

           Additionally, the investigator assume that there is a 25% chance (midrange) to
           discontinue CPAP treatment and 70% (midrange) compliance. Compliance will be normalized
           to a percentage scale by dividing by the expected hours of sleep (for the power
           analysis, we take 7 hours expected sleep). A hypothetical difference of 1 hour will
           therefore represent 14.29% (=1/7).

           For the t-tests:

           Standard deviation: based on a 95% interval for CPAP [4h-9h], the investigator divide
           this interval of 5 h by 4 (4 sigma's for 95%). Followed by a normalization (1/7), one
           sigma gives 17.86%. With a power of 0.9 and α= 0.01 (Bonferonni correction), 128
           patients will be needed for an unbalanced design of both groups in a ratio of 75% versus
           25%.

           For the Fisher Exact- test:

           General OSA population Expected in type D Good compliance 70% (between 60 &amp; 80%) 56% (
           70% minus 14%) Poor compliance 30% 44%

           With a power of 0.9: in total 580 patients are needed. (580 patients of which 25% type
           D: Feasible since about 500 new OSA patients are diagnosed and treated a year at the UZ
           Brussels)

        4. To determine the influence of type D personality on cardiovascular complications in OSA.

      Baseline polysomnography: two groups: OSA with type D and without type D and questionnaires:
      ESS, PSQI, DS-14, SF-36, ISI, FAS, HADS, BFI-2, CIS. Search medical files for cardiovascular
      morbidity in both groups Additionally, the investigator assume that there is a 25% chance
      (midrange) to discontinue CPAP treatment and 70% (midrange) compliance. Compliance will be
      normalized to a percentage scale by dividing by the expected hours of sleep (for the power
      analysis, we take 7 hours expected sleep). A hypothetical difference of 1 hour will therefore
      represent 14.29% (=1/7).

      For the t-tests:

      Standard deviation: based on a 95% interval for CPAP [4h-9h], the investigator divide this
      interval of 5 h by 4 (4 sigma's for 95%). Followed by a normalization (1/7), one sigma gives
      17.86%. With a power of 0.9 and α= 0.01 (Bonferonni correction), 128 patients will be needed
      for an unbalanced design of both groups in a ratio of 75% versus 25%.

      For the Fisher Exact- test:

      General OSA population Expected in type D Good compliance 70% (between 60 &amp; 80%) 56% ( 70%
      minus 14%) Poor compliance 30% 44%

      With a power of 0.9: in total 580 patients are needed. (580 patients of which 25% type D:
      Feasible since about 500 new OSA patients are diagnosed and treated a year at the UZ
      Brussels)

      Procedures To determine the overall prevalence of type D personality in untreated OSA
      patients and their subtypes, all patients admitted to the sleep laboratory for a
      polysomnography will be asked to participate to this study. An informed consent will be
      signed and patients will complete a number of questionnaires. In the current practice of the
      sleep laboratory, the Epworth sleepiness scale, the Stanford sleepiness scale, the Pittsburgh
      sleep quality index, the Insomnia severity scale, the DS-14 questionnaire, the SF-36
      questionnaire, the FAS, HADS, BFI-2 and CIS are filled out by each patient.

      All patients who test positive for OSA (AHI &gt; 5/hour) and positive for type D personality
      (DS-14: SI&gt;10 and NA&gt;10) will be asked to complete these questionnaires once more 1 month
      later. This is necessary to evaluate the test-retest reliability/stability of the DS-14
      questionnaire in OSA. To evaluate the validity of this questionnaire in OSA, correlation
      patterns with the BFI-2 and the HADS will be investigated.

      For all patients diagnosed with moderate OSA in which treatment with CPAP is indicated, the
      questionnaires will be repeated during their second polysomnography (standard of care), 3
      months after the second polysomnography (standard of care) and 1 year after this last visit
      (standard of care). The second polysomnography is needed to estimate the therapeutic pressure
      and to meet the criteria for the OSA convention. The time necessary for treatment education
      (time to explain function of CPAP), frequency of visits and time necessary to deal with
      complications, treatment compliance (hours of use CPAP device), treatment discontinuation
      will be monitored. The group with OSA and type D personality will be compared with the OSA
      group without type D personality.

      A search for cardiovascular events in the electronic medical file of all OSA patients with
      and without type D personality will be carried out.

      The above mentioned procedures will all be carried out in the sleep laboratory of the UZ
      Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 101, 1090 Jette.
