  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand if transesophageal echocardiography during
      cardiac surgery can predict problems with kidney function after cardiac surgery.

      Informed consent will be obtained prior to surgery. Preoperative demographic and baseline
      clinical data will be collected. We will assess the patient's risk of postoperative AKI using
      the validated Cleveland clinic score based on preoperative risk factors and calculate the
      European System Operative Score Risk Evaluation score (EuroSCORE II). After standard
      anesthesia induction and intubation, a TEE probe will be inserted by a cardiac
      anesthesiologist, who is certified in intraoperative echocardiography. We will use a standard
      ultrasound machine (EPIQ 7 Philips;Philips, Bothell, WA). Images of the right or left kidney
      along with Doppler flow and velocities will be obtained prior to cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB), after CPB, and after chest closure. Images of the portal vein with Doppler flow and
      velocity will be obtained prior to CPB, after CPB, and after chest closure. Vitals signs and
      hemodynamic data will be collected concurrently during these times. (See Data Sheet)
      Concurrent ECG will be obtained to identify the phases of the cardiac cycle. Mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) will be maintained within 20% of baseline MAP with bolus or continuous
      infusion of vasopressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin,
      ephedrine). Cardiopulmonary bypass management will be standard, with target systemic blood
      flow of 2.4L/min/m2. Postoperative data will include urine output, serum creatinine,
      calculated GFR (using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] method) hospital and ICU
      length of stay, and 30-day mortality.
