  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iLet is a closed-loop delivery system that can be used in insulin-only, bihormonal, or
      glucagon-only configurations. Previous studies have utilized a phone-based bionic pancreas.
      The iLet consists of a touchscreen-enabled, menu-driven user interface and an onboard
      microprocessor that provides a comprehensive and standalone platform, which allows the iLet
      to operate independently of smartphones or other devices and without the need for internet
      support during routine operation.

      This is a multicenter study of pediatric participants with type 1 diabetes, who will manage
      their diabetes with the iLet bionic pancreas compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 pediatric participants from three clinical sites (Colorado, Nemours, and Stanford) will
      take part in the Pediatric Transitional Study Session to assess the efficacy, safety, and
      reliability of the insulin-only configuration of the bionic pancreas in regulating glycemia
      in pediatric subjects in a more supervised setting prior to beginning the true outpatient
      study. The Pediatric Transitional Study Session will consist of a multi-center, two-period,
      random-order, cross-over, pilot study in 20 pediatric participants 6-17 years old with T1D (~
      6 adolescent participants at Colorado 12-17 years old, ~ 6 pre-adolescent participants at
      Nemours 6-11 years old, and ~ 8 pediatrics subjects at Stanford 6-17 years old). Insulin
      therapy for each participant will be administered (i) in one period using the iLet in the
      insulin-only configuration with the iLet pigtail adapter and the iLet ready-to-fill insulin
      cartridge, the Contact Detach infusion set, the Dexcom G5 CGM, and the insulin analog that
      they use for their usual care (either Humalog or Novolog), and (ii) in the other period using
      the participant's own usual care (UC), where each participant will wear a Dexcom G5 CGM. Both
      experimental periods will be followed by round-the-clock, remote, telemetric monitoring for
      hyperglycemia (&gt; 300 mg/dl for ≥ 90 minutes) and hypoglycemia (&lt; 50 mg/dl for ≥ 15 minutes).
      The two experimental periods will each span 5 days, including 4 nights (e.g. Monday-Friday).
      A washout period of ~ 3 days in duration will separate the two experimental periods of the
      Pediatric Transitional Study Session.

      Both study periods will be conducted in the same clinically supervised setting during each of
      the 5 days and at home under parental supervision or other overnight companion who is
      available to serve as an emergency contact during each of the 4 nights. Parents/guardians
      must be present (i.e. in the house or building) while the participant is home and sleeping
      and will serve as the contact person for overnight alerts. During the daytime in the
      Pediatric Transitional Study Session, participants of each cohort will be with the clinical
      study staff at each of the three clinical sites and will engage in common activities such
      that meals and activities can be well-characterized and supervised. For further
      quantification of stress due to exercise, activity monitors will be worn by all of the
      participants in both periods of the study. In terms of physical activity, diet, and remote
      monitoring for hypo- and hyperglycemia, parity will be maintained between both study periods.

      All 20 pediatric participants in the Pediatric Transitional Study Session will use insulin
      pump therapy for their usual diabetes management. The Dexcom G5 CGM will serve as the input
      CGM to the iLet for all 20 pediatric participants. The cohort of 6 adolescent participants at
      Colorado and 6 pre-adolescent participants at Nemours, and 8 participants at Stanford might
      overlap or might not overlap in time.

             of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety
             of the participant

          9. Pregnant (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the next 12
             months, or sexually active and at risk for pregnancy without use of contraception

         11. Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, even if by
             prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal investigator)

         12. Stage 4 renal failure (eGFR &lt;30) or Stage 5 renal failure on dialysis (hemodialysis or
             peritoneal dialysis)

         13. History of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, or other pancreatic disease, including
             pancreatic tumor or insulinoma, or history of complete pancreatectomy

         14. Coronary artery disease that is not stable with medical management, including unstable
             angina, angina that prevents moderate exercise (e.g. exercise of intensity up to 6
             METS) despite medical management, or within the last 12 months before screening a
             history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, enzymatic lysis
             of a presumed coronary occlusion, or coronary artery bypass grafting

             limited to, evidence of active ischemia, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's
             sign), or prolonged QT interval (&gt; 440 ms). Other EKG findings, including stable Q
             waves, are not grounds for exclusion as long as the participant is not excluded
             according to other criteria. A reassuring evaluation by a cardiologist after an
             abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

             • EKG is only required for participants ≥50 years old or with diabetes duration ≥20
             years

         16. For participants &lt; 50 years of age and &lt; 20 years since diagnosis: History of

             months. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event that required assistance of another
             person due to altered consciousness, and required another person to actively
             administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. This means that the
             participant was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat
             himself/herself, was unable to verbalize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented,
             and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma.

         20. History of more than 1 episode of DKA requiring hospitalization in the last 2 years

         21. History of more than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia in the last year.

         22. Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect
             glucose regulation.

         23. Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be
             susceptible to RF interference

         24. Unable or unwilling to completely avoid acetaminophen for duration of study

         25. Established history of allergy or severe reaction to adhesive or tape that must be
             used in the study

         26. History of eating disorder within the last 2 years, such as anorexia, bulimia, or
             diabulemia or omission of insulin to manipulate weight

         27. Current or planned use of SGLT2 inhibitors (prior use more than 3 months prior to
             enrollment is acceptable; SGLT2 inhibitors should not be initiated during the trial)

         28. If using GLP1, pramlintide, or metformin must be on a stable dose for 3 months prior
             to enrollment (these agents should not be initiated during the trial)

         29. Required use of 2 or more steroid bursts in the 6 months prior to the trial

         30. History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
             hypoglycemia requiring treatment

         31. Any factors that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or clinical
             protocol chair, would interfere with the safe completion of the study, including
             medical conditions that may require hospitalization during the trial
