    <textblock>
      The goal of the current pragmatic trial is to evaluate the impact of a simple method of
      selecting a treatment approach for identified mutations on participants' progression free
      survival (PFS). The study also intends to collect information on barriers that investigators
      encounter when prescribing treatment options using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
      reports. Additionally, patients' quality of life will be measured before, after, and during
      treatment.

      Patients will be followed until death for monitoring survival study endpoints.

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To estimate the progression-free ratio, as defined by the progression-free survival time on
      study treatment divided by the progression-free survival time on the last treatment received
      by patient, for an identified actionable mutation, who will be treated with an off-label
      treatment off label therapy based on a simplified selection methodology using the Next
      Generation Sequencing results.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate patient response rate on off-label treatments for actionable mutations based
           on Next Generation Sequencing results.

        -  To estimate overall survival (OS) for patients treated with off-label treatments for
           actionable mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

        -  To describe the safety of using off-label or other experimental treatments for patients
           with actionable mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To describe health related quality of life in patients undergoing off-label treatment
           targeting genetic mutations, as measured by the PROMIS-29 Overall Health-Related Quality
           of Life, Including 4-Item Anxiety Subscale.

        -  Using the Satisfaction with Medical Decision Scale, to describe patient satisfaction
           with decision to pursue off-label treatment.

        -  To identify types of actionable mutations with available targeted treatment occurring in
           cancer patients.

        -  To characterize the historical treatment regimens for these patients relative to the
           targetable mutation.

        -  To describe patient clinical and demographic characteristics of those with actionable
           mutations based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

        -  To identify barriers to treatment based on Next Generation Sequencing results.

    <description>Estimation of progression-free ratio defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to the time of progression divided by the duration of time from the last treatment received pre-trial to the time of progression on that treatment. The median progression-free ratio will be estimated with the range and a two-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank test will be calculated to see if the progression free survival ratio is different from 1.0. This trial is powered to detect differences in the progression-free ratio for those with actionable mutations identified by NGS results and then treated with a targeted therapy. A hypothesized PFS ratio larger than 1.3 would suggest that the targeted therapy is doing better than the previous treatment received (not targeted), and we assume a null hypothesis PFS ratio of 1.0 (no difference).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cancer patients at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center and its satellites
             who have next generation DNA sequencing results on their tumor biopsy or surgically
             resected tissue and/or blood samples and/or consent to the Wake Forest Comprehensive
             Cancer Center Precision Oncology Registry to use their information for research.

          -  Actionable mutation Actionable mutation (defined as a mutation for which an off-label
             therapy is identified on the patient's NGS report for which NCCN guidelines do not
             recommend a specific treatment in the particular disease or for which there is no
             documentation in the patient's medical record of clinical data demonstrating lack of
             activity with the targeting of the specific mutation in the patient's specific
             disease) uncovered by the genomic sequencing of a tumor or those that have undergone
             liquid biopsy assay of their tumor genomic, performed by Wake Forest or another and
             who are medically able to receive targeted therapy based on those results.

          -  Sequencing on a sample collected within 3 months prior to registration is strongly
             encouraged but must have been performed within the 12 months prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have progressed through at least two lines of treatment, or are not
             candidates for or unwilling to receive any standard therapies. Patients who have
             received treatment on the present protocol who have progression of disease may be
             recruited to the trial for treatment using another targeted therapy provided that they
             fulfill the other criteria for participation in the trial. If a patient discontinues
             treatment on this protocol they can be considered for further participation in this
             trial provided they meet all of the eligibility criteria and are eligible for
             re-registration and re-consent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of less than or equal to 3

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 weeks

          -  The effects of the drugs used for cancer treatment on the developing human fetus are
             unknown. For this reason and because of the possibility that the agents are
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy to major bone marrow bearing sites
             within 2 weeks prior to receiving treatment on the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from toxicity of prior treatment if such toxicity will
             preclude treatment with the proposed targeted agent.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to the targeted agent.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the targeted
             agent, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the targeted
             agent.
