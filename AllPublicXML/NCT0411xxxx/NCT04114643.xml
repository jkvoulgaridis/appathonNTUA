  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, active-control, pragmatic, Phase 2 pilot study in adult
      cardiac surgery patients. Two Canadian hospitals will participate, and it is estimated that
      the study will take approximately 9 months to complete.

      Approximately 120 bleeding adult cardiac surgical patients who require coagulation factor
      replacement during cardiac surgery will be included. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either PCC or FP when the blood bank receives the first order for coagulation factor
      replacement and deems it to be in accordance with accepted clinical standards. Patients will
      be treated according to their assigned group on the first and second times when coagulation
      factor replacement is ordered during the treatment period (24 hours after randomization). For
      any additional doses (i.e., the third dose and thereafter), patients in both groups will
      receive FP (in 1U increments at the discretion of the ordering physician). No other aspects
      of care will be modified.

      This pilot study aims to select a clinically relevant primary efficacy endpoint for a
      confirmative Phase 3 study, which will subsequently aim to determine if PCC is non-inferior
      or superior to FP in terms of effica-cy and safety in bleeding cardiac surgical patients. In
      the pilot study, safety outcomes will be measured for the first 28 days, which is the
      duration of participation of each patient in the trial.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients undergoing any index cardiac surgery with or without CPB in whom coagulation
        factor replacement with PCC or FP is ordered in the operating room for:

          1. Management of bleeding, or

          2. Anticipated bleeding in a patient who has

               1. been on-pump for &gt;2 hours, or

               2. undergone a complex procedure (e.g., ACB + AVR). Coagulation factor deficiency
                  must either be known to exist (as indicated by elevated EXTEM clotting time [CT]
                  or international normalized ratio [INR]), or be suspected based on the clinical
                  situation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for the study:

          1. Undergoing heart transplantation, insertion or removal of ventricular assist devices
             (not including intra-aortic balloon pump [IABP]), or repair of thoracoabdominal
             aneurysm

          2. Critical state immediately before emergency surgery with high probability of death
             within 24 hours of surgery (e.g., acute aortic dissection, cardiac arrest within 24
             hours before start of surgery)

          3. History of heparin induced thrombocytopenia

          4. Last preoperative INR &gt;1.5 and patient on warfarin

          5. Taken dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban within 48 hours of start of
             surgery

          6. Administered PCC or FP within 48 hours before start of surgery

          7. History of severe allergic reaction to PCC or FP

          8. Refusal of allogeneic blood products due to religious or other reasons

          9. Known pregnancy
