    <textblock>
      18-55 years old 100 patients, who are planned to undergo for planned ureteroscopy will be
      participated in the study. In the preoperative room patients will be asked to participate to
      the study. If they accept 4 item Jenkins-Sleep Questionaire will be asked to them.Patients
      will be divided to two groups , with or without insomnia according to their answers to the
      questionaire. General anesthesia will be performed to all patients. At the end of operation
      anesthesia time,operation time, time of eye opening, time of transfer to the recovery room
      will be recorded in the operating room. Pain scores and recovery scores will be evaluated in
      the recovery room.

      18-55 years old 100 patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status
      I-II,who are planned to undergo for elective ureteroscopy will be participated in this
      study.In the preoperative room patients will be asked to participate to the study and will be
      asked to answer the 4-item Jenkins-Sleep Questionaire.If they accept to participate, written
      informed consent will be taken from the patients. According to their answers to the
      questionaire , patients will be divided into two groups :those with or without
      insomnia.General anesthesia will be performed to all patients. After anesthesia induction
      with propofol 2mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, patients will be ıntubated and mechanically
      ventilated. Maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved with 4-6 % desflurane in nitrous
      oxide/ oxygen (50%/50%) concentrations with the flow 5L/min. Tramadol 1 mg/kg and
      metoclopramid 1 ampul will be administered intravenously after intubation. Hemodynamic
      parameters( systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral
      oxygen saturation), end tidal carbon dioxide values, the concentrations of inspired and
      exhaled desflurane will be recorded on the surgery start time and on the 5th,
      15th,25th,35th,45th,60 th minutes of surgery. At the end of operation ,neuromuscular blockage
      will be reversed with neostigmine (0,05 mg/kg)and atropine sulphate 0,015 mg/kg i.v.
      Anesthesia time, surgery time, time of eye opening,time of transfer to the recovery room will
      be recorded in the operating room. In the recovery room pain score will be evaluated with
      Visual Analogue Scale. Modified Aldrete Recovery Score will be used for evaluating recovery.
