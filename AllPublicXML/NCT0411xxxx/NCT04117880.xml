  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study evaluating the overall systemic and ocular
      safety profile of ataluren in nonsense mutation aniridia as determined by the incidences of
      treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as well as abnormal findings on laboratory
      assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, ophthalmoscopy, and slit-lamp examination.

      Participants who complete PTC124-GD-028 ANI (NCT02647359) meet all inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled into this study.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Participants who will be selected for this study must meet the following criteria:

          1. Evidence of signed and dated informed consent document(s) indicating that the study
             candidate (and/or a parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects
             of the study. Note: If the study candidate is considered a child under local
             regulation, a parent or legal guardian must provide written consent prior to
             initiation of study screening procedures and the study candidate may be required to
             provide written assent. The rules of the responsible institutional review
             board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) regarding whether one or both parents
             must provide consent and the appropriate ages for obtaining consent and assent from
             the participant should be followed.

          2. Must have participated in and exited from Study PTC124-GD-028 ANI

          3. Age ≥2 years and of either gender.

          4. Body weight ≥12 kg.

          5. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             study procedures, and study restrictions.

          6. Good general health.

          7. Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible for the study but must be
             willing to use adequate (at least 1 form of) contraceptive methods as described below
             during the study treatment period (starting from the day of first dose of study drug
             and ending 60 days after the last dose of study drug). Childbearing potential is
             defined as participants who have experienced menarche and who are neither
             postmenopausal or have been permanently sterilized.

               -  Hormonal methods of contraception (including oral and transdermal contraceptives,
                  injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants, progesterone-releasing
                  intrauterine contraceptive devices [IUDs]) initiated at least 14 days prior to
                  the first dose of study drug

               -  Abstinence

               -  Placement of a copper-containing IUD

               -  Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

               -  Postmenopausal at least 12 months prior to first dose of study drug or
                  permanently sterilized (for example, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral
                  salpingectomy)

               -  Male partner who has had a vasectomy for at least 3 months prior to the first
                  dose of study drug

          8. Male participants with partners of childbearing potential must agree to use the
             following adequate (at least 1 form of) contraception during the study treatment
             period (starting from the day of first dose of study drug and ending 60 days after the
             last dose of study drug):

               -  Abstinence

               -  Vasectomy for at least 3 months prior to first dose of study drug or surgically
                  sterile

               -  Without a vasectomy, must use a condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream
                  suppository

        Exclusion Criteria

        The presence of any of the following conditions will exclude a participant from study
        enrollment:

        General exclusion criteria

          1. Participation in any drug or device clinical investigation (other than Study
             PTC124-GD-028 ANI) within 90 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or anticipation of
             participating in any other drug or device clinical investigation during this study.

          2. Surgery within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          3. Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female participants of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [β-HCG]) at screening and must use adequate (at least 1 form of)
             contraceptive methods.

          4. Active ocular infection or inflammation.

          5. Prior or ongoing medical condition (for example, concomitant illness, alcoholism, drug
             abuse, psychiatric condition), medical history, physical findings, or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of
             the participant, makes it unlikely that the course of study drug administration or
             follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.

          6. Participants with a positive result for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human
             immunodeficiency virus at Visit 1 (Screening).
