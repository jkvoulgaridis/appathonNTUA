  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) is due to gastric content reflux to esophagus cause
      symptom and complication including intra-esophagus such as reflux esophagitis, and
      extra-esophagus such as cough etc. Because the changes of dietary habit, and improvement of
      examination skill and data analysis, the prevalence of GERD increased 2.5 multiple from 1995
      to 2002, and suggesting the prevalence is 25% in Taiwan community.

      The etiology of GERD is multi-effect, such as transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation
      and abnormal pressure of lower esophageal sphincter, which may induced the esophageal mucosal
      injury by gastric acid, bile or pancreases enzyme.

      Wu-Chu-Yu tang consists of Evodia fargesii Dode (Evodia Fruit), Panax ginseng C. (Ginseng),
      Ziziphus jujube Mill (Chinses Date), Zingiber officinale Rosee (Fresh Ginger).According to
      &quot;I-Fang-Chi-Chieh&quot; and &quot;Shanghonzobinglun&quot; recordings that Wu-Chu-Yu tang can treat vomiting,
      and also can relax gastric tonicity and can enhance peristalsis of stomach. According to
      Randomized, double blind, placebo control trial to evaluate the efficacy of Wu-Chu-Yu Tang on
      gastroesophageal reflux disease, we know the Wu-Chu-Yu tang have the equivalent effect proton
      pump inhibitor omeprazole. But, the mechanism of Wu-Chu-Yu tang is still unknown.

    <description>DeMeester score had two major component as 1.total time of pH&lt;4(%) and 2.number of reflux episode. Each major part had two minor component.Fist one, percentage of total time pH&lt;4, had 1. percentage of upright time when pH&lt;4 and 2.percentage of supine time when pH&lt;4. Secondary part, number of reflux episode, had 1.number of reflux episode over 5 mintues and 2.longest reflux time. Finally, there was a composite score as the DeMeester score.</description>

    <measure>Reflux Disease Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Reflux Disease Questionnaire had one major component as Thinking about your symptoms over the past 7 days, how often have you had the following? And then there were six minor component: a. A burning feeling behind your breastbone b. Pain behind your breastbone c. A burning feeling in the centre of the upper stomach d. Pain in the centre of the upper stomach e. An acid taste in your mouth f. Unpleasant movement ofmaterial upwards from the stomach. Each question was different frequency as have not had, 1 day, 2 days, 3-4 days, 5-6 days or daily in one week.
Each frequency had one score and subscale had score from one to six. The total score was one to thirty six. The score more less means more better outcome.</description>
