  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates a novel approach to animal-assisted interventions through a series of
      wildlife immersion activities (wildlife observation, wildlife rehabilitation and bird
      feeding/watching) for veterans who have suffered trauma as part of their military duty.
      Findings from this study will advance scientific knowledge about the benefits of wildlife
      activities for veterans with PTSD including the acceptability, feasibility, safety and
      preliminary influence on physical and mental well-being. The findings will be instrumental in
      advancing a new area of health intervention research for veterans in settings that are
      publicly accessible and family-oriented for sustainable, low-cost interventions with
      potential application in other populations.
