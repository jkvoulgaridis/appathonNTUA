  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) is an autoimune disease of unknown etiology characterized by
      lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands and other organs. patients usually presents
      with xerophthalmia, xerostomia, fatigue and other symptoms. Fatigue has often been reported
      as the biggest problem and the most difficult symptom patients have to deal with. Fatigue
      management in pSS is difficult. However, in other diseases such as Parkinson disease,
      post-polio syndrome and multiple sclerosis the use of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS) has recently been studied and has shown effectiveness. The overarching objective of
      this study is to examine the effect of a tDCS protocol in patients with pSS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in fatigue from baseline to 15 days after the end of stimulation.</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). FSS is a 9-item scale which measures the severity of fatigue and its effect on a person's activities and lifestyle in patients with a variety of disorders. The items are scored on a 7-point scale. Higher values indicate higher severity of fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Profile of Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured at baseline, on the 5th day of stimulation (immediately after the end of stimulation), 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort - Sicca Symptoms Inventory (short form) (Profad-SSI-SF). Profad-SSI-SF is a 19-item questionnaire assessing the subjective aspects of the symptoms of Sjogren's Syndrome, including fatigue, based on the patient's perception. The items are scored from 0 to 7 points. Higher values indicate higher severity of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptoms severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured at baseline, on the 5th day of stimulation (immediately after the end of stimulation), 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI). ESSPRI is a very simple index designed to measure patients' symptoms of patients with Sjogren's Syndrome. ESSPRI is completed by the patient and it contains just three items to be given a score between 0-10: for pain, fatigue and dryness, the final ESSPRI score is the mean of all three scores and therefore also between 0-10. Higher values indicate higher severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured at baseline, on the 5th day of stimulation (immediately after the end of stimulation), 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with 12-Item Short-Form (SF-12). The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions. The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured after the 1st, 5th day of stimulation, 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will rate their global assessment using verbal response and a visual analog scale (0-10). They will rate: Global health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured up to 30 days after the end of stimulation.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete a structured questionnaire to assess potential adverse events of stimulation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured immediately before and immediately after the first day of stimulation and immediately before and immediately after the last day (5th) day of stimulation.</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary cortisol</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured at baseline, on the 5th day of stimulation (immediately after the end of stimulation), 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). PSQI is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality. It's composed by nineteen individual items that generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. The global PSQI score ranges from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured at baseline, on the 5th day of stimulation (immediately after the end of stimulation), 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). BDI is a 21-item self-report inventory, for measuring the severity of depression. The items are scored from 0 to 3 points. Higher values indicate higher severity of depression.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Self Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be measured at baseline, on the 5th day of stimulation (immediately after the end of stimulation), 15 days after the end of stimulation and 30 days after the end of stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will rate their assessment using verbal response and a visual analog scale (0-10). They will rate: Anxiety, stress and sleepiness.</description>
