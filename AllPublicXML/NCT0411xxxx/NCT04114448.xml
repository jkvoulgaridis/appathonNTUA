      Objectives: To assess the efficacy of performing a therapeutic exercise program, compared
      with usual care, on pain relief, range of movement and self-perceived quality of life in
      patients with hemophilia

      Design: Quantitative, experimental, longitudinal and prospective study.

      Subjects: Male patients between 30 and 45 years old, with hemophilia type A or B and with
      knee, ankle or elbow arthropathy caused by hemophilia. Participants may be undergoing a
      pharmacologic treatment with intravenous VIII and/or IX factor

      Methods: Participants in the experimental group will an intervention based on therapeutic
      exercise. One therapist will instruct the patients during two sessions (each lasting
      approximately 1 hour). Participants will be asked to continue this program at least twice a
      week. Meanwhile, those in the control group will receive usual physical therapy care, based
      on a more passive approach, including self-assisted joint mobilization and muscle stretching.
      Those in the control group will be also instructed to perform the protocol at home, at least
      twice a week. The intervention protocol in both groups will last three months

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) in the evaluated muscles.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PPT levels will be evaluated in KPa. PPT levels, defined as the minimum necessary pressure to evoke pain will be evaluated using a handheld electronic pressure algometer.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported pain intensity: Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported pain will be evaluated using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), where 0 denotes no pain at all, and 10 denotes the maximum possible pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of movement (ROM).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Active ROM of the affected joint will be evaluated using inertial sensors, that measure lineal acceleration and angular velocity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>General flexibility will be assessed using the improved tot-flex test, which makes possible to extrapolate general flexibility from a combined movement measure.</description>

    <measure>Daily life activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Ordinary daily life activities will be assessed using the Haemophilia Activities List, which measures the self-perceived functional state.</description>

    <measure>Self-perceived quality of life: A36 Haemophilia-QoL test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated using the A36 Haemophilia-QoL test. This is a valid and specific tool for hemophiliac adults.</description>

    <description>Patients will be trained to perform a therapeutic exercise intervention protocol. The program will be based on active physical activity including strength, balance an coordination exercises, among others. Each initial contact session will last approximately 1 hour. After baseline, participants will be instructed to undergo at least two sessions per week during 3 consecutive months.</description>

    <description>Patients will be instructed to perform an usual care physical therapy intervention protocol. Participants in this group will be told to undergo gentle self-performed joint mobilization and stretching exercises. Each initial contact session will last approximately 1 hour.
