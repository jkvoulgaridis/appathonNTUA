  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, it is estimated that 318,590 Americans, men and women, will be diagnosed with breast
      cancer (American Cancer Society, 13). It was predicted in the 1970s that 1 in 11 Americans
      would be diagnosed with breast cancer, currently, it is 1 in 8 people. A person is twice as
      likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer if they have one first-degree female with a
      diagnosis, 3-4 times if there is more than one first-degree female relative with a diagnosis.
      Reasons for this increase in breast cancer diagnoses are that people are living longer,
      changes in reproductive patterns, increases or decreases in menopausal hormone use, increased
      numbers of detection through screening including genetic testing, and the rising prevalence
      of obesity (American Cancer Society). The purpose of this study is to better understand how a
      diagnosis of breast cancer supports change in diet and their food story.

      Qualitative methodology and specifically the long interview is the method the team will use
      to gain insight into adult patients' perceptions of their food story.

      1. All interviews will occur at a community clinic or convenient community location.

        2. Clinical faculty will receive an oral and written overview of the project prior to
           beginning in case they have patients they want to recommend to participate.

        3. Physician will approach individual patients to participate during a regular medical
           office visit, patients will be given an introduction and overview of the study, and then
           will be asked if they would like to participate in the study.

        4. If the patient wants to participate, Malika Siker, MD will schedule a time for the
           patient to meet with a member of the study team to conduct the interview.

        5. The interview will be scheduled at a time convenient for the patient.

        6. If the patient does not want to participate, no further action is required

        7. All study subjects will be adults with the ability to understand the study and consent
           to participate.

        8. The sample will be a convenience sample based upon interest in participating.

        9. At the time of the interview, patients will receive a written and oral overview of the
           research.

       10. The subject will have ample time to ask questions before completing the survey or
           beginning the interview.

           All study subjects will understand and agree to having the interview audiotaped.

       11. The interview will take place immediately after the subject has agreed to participate.

       12. Interviews will last between approximately 60 minutes. Subjects can decline to answer
           any question and can withdraw from the study at any time during the process.

       13. Our highest estimate is that 50 subjects will be needed to complete the project.

       14. Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim by a transcription service
           following the conclusion of the interview.

       15. The transcriptionist will be instructed to remove any names of individuals that may be
           discussed by the subject.

       16. Transcriptions will be placed in a password protected computer file.

       17. PI will review the transcripts to ensure that transcriptions are anonymous.

       18. When determined, PI will instruct that the recording be erased.

       19. The team will only begin analysis after ensuring that all transcripts are anonymous.

       20. The team will analyze the data for thick description and for themes that emerge during
           the analysis by following procedures developed by Corbin and Strauss.

        Little is known about a patient and their food stories before, during and after cancer
        treatment. The investigators would like to understand how cancer impacts a patients food
        narrative. Patients that live in areas where food is less readily accessible maybe looking
        for ways to improve their food narrative. This population will only include any 18 or older
        adult with a history of breast cancer.
