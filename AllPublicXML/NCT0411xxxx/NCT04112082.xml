  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an assessor-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial to evaluate the benefit of
      home-based training with a low-cost, mobile neurofeedback system (Myndlift) in adults with
      ADHD. Randomized controlled trials have shown significant benefit for neurofeedback,
      including persistent effects without the side effects of psychostimulants (i.e., diminished
      appetite, insomnia, anxiety, irritability). However, standard application requires clinic
      visits and significant expense, limiting training frequency and compromising potential
      efficacy. Additionally, extant evidence for efficacy comes almost exclusively from children
      and adolescents, with very few studies in adults. The present trial will measure the ability
      of home-based neurofeedback using a low-cost, user-friendly system to ameliorate
      symptomatology (e.g., enhancing attention, reducing impulsive behavior) in adults with ADHD.
      Participants will receive either neurofeedback or treatment as usual (TAU). Primary outcomes
      will be objective scores on a continuous performance task (CPT) and subjective report on a
      standardized adult ADHD symptoms questionnaire. Eligible participants recruited from an adult
      ADHD clinic will complete a baseline assessment (1.25 hours) including subjective
      questionnaires, computerized cognitive assessment, and resting-state EEG administered by a
      blinded assessor. The experimental group will train at home with a neurofeedback headset and
      tablet 4 times/week for ten weeks (session duration: 21-30 minutes). Neurofeedback will be
      provided via a conventional theta beta protocol in which participants train using gamified
      tasks, videos, or audio clips in a tablet-based app, and receive positive visual/auditory
      feedback when their brainwaves are in the desired range. The control group will follow the
      regular treatment plan set by the clinic (i.e., treatment as usual; TAU). Care may include
      pharmacological intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a combination of both, or
      no intervention. Care will often include pharmacological intervention (e.g.,
      methylphenidate), with the specifics (e.g., type of medication, dosage) determined by
      psychiatrist recommendation. After completing the ten-week intervention period, all
      participants will return to the clinic for a follow-up assessment identical to the baseline
      assessment. It is hypothesized that home-based neurofeedback training will demonstrate
      non-inferiority to TAU as measured by improvement in subjective and objective symptoms.

    <description>Treatment plan as part of regular care at the ADHD clinic, which may include pharmacological intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a combination of pharmacological intervention and CBT, or no intervention. Care will often include pharmacological intervention, with the specifics (e.g., type of medication, dosage) determined by psychiatrist recommendation considering such factors as response to previous interventions, participant characteristics, and practical constraints. Most pharmacological interventions will be stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) with various release mechanisms. Each participant will receive an individualized dose titration and follow-up plan, including clinic visits as needed (generally 1-2 visits over the 10-week intervention period); interventions may be switched in accord with clinical judgment.</description>
