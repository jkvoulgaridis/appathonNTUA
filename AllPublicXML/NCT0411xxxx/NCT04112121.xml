  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the &quot;HEALING&quot; &quot; (Hospital-based Ecumenical And Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) Study
      was to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized participants after
      meeting a chaplain and Biblical listenings, in order to evaluate whether these meetings
      affect the course of the disease.

    <textblock>
      The authors pre-screened hospitalized participants to find those who were the most in need of
      an intervention by a chaplain. A passage from the Bible was read to the participants during a
      meeting with the chaplain at the bedside, or in the chapel of the hospital. No meeting
      occurred in the randomized control group, which was compiled in a way to get a group of
      participants with an approximatively similar pattern of diagnoses and treatment days than the
      intervention groups. The pace of enrollment was deliberately slow in order to assure the
      authenticity of the visits (&quot;slow science&quot;). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and
      60 minutes after the meeting to measure White Blood Cell (WBC)-, lymphocyte counts,
      interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-, immunoglobulin M (IgM)-, immunoglobulin A (IgA)-, immunoglobulin G
      (IgG)-, and complement C3 levels. A subgroup of the visited participants was subjected to
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings
      of the same passage from the Bible. Associative tests, paired-samples t-test, network
      analysis was performed to search for any correlation between psychological and immunological
      parameters, completed with Statistical Parametric Mapping to search for correlations of the
      above with neurological parameters.

    <description>PSS-14 Scale uses 14 questions with answers ranging from 0 to 4, with higher values indicating higher levels of distress on the seven negative-, and lower levels of distress on the seven positive items. Scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the seven positive items, then summing across all to give the total PSS-14 Score.</description>
