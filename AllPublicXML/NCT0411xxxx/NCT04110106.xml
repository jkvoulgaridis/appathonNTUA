      This study aim to evaluate the correlation between Quality of Life (QoL) and severity of
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) by assessing the presence of an optimal cut-off point on the
      Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39) as related to the Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H&amp;Y) scale in a
      cohort of Italian adults with PD.

      A multicenter, cross-sectional study was performed in central and northern Italy. This study
      was conducted on a cohort of consecutive individuals at three neurologic outpatient clinics.
      All participants were evaluated with the PDQ-39, and the severity of PD was recorded
      according to the H&amp;Y scale by a neurologist. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
      and coordinates of the curve, which were visually inspected, were used to find cut-off points
      with optimal sensitivity and specificity. These were in turn used to determine the optimal
      PDQ-39 cut-off score for identifying disease severity according to H&amp;Y stages.

        Fivehundred thirteen individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) were recruited, all of whom
        agreed to participate and were thus included in the study. From the general analysis
        resulted that the greatest number of participants were stage II, according to Hoehn &amp; Yahr
        (H&amp;Y), followed by stage III, stage I, and finally stage IV. Participants between the age
        of 50 and 69 were mainly stage I or II, while participants aged 70 to 89 had a greater
        severity of PD (stage II and III). Most women were in H&amp;Y stage II and III, while most men
        were mainly in stage II, followed by stage I and III, with a very similar number of
        participants. A common result for all analyses was the presence of a very low number of
        participants with stage IV.
