  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site, non-randomized, data collection study. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the correlation between pacing sites and ECG morphology or pacing
      parameters during left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) and perform the use condition analysis to
      assess the long-term performance of pacing lead during LBBP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      His bundle pacing (HBP) is a physiological pacing, but also has some limitations, including
      high and unstable pacing threshold in 5-10% patients, low R-wave amplitude causing
      inappropriate pacing management, damage to the His bundle during implantation. On the other
      hand, left bundle branch pacing (LBBP), achieved via trans-ventricular septal approach with
      the pacing lead tip at the left side of the ventricular septum, has recently initiated and
      been widely practiced in China because of easy implantation, relatively narrow paced QRS
      duration, low and stable pacing threshold, high R wave amplitude, and the LBBB correction by
      a low pacing output.

      As LBBP is in the early phase of clinical practice in China, in order to better conduct LBBP
      implantation and understand mechanisms of LBBP therapy, physicians often do imaging
      assessment of the pacing lead in patients implanted with LBBP based on clinical necessity.

      Additionally, there is no report of mid/long-term correlation between lead location and
      ventricular electrical activity, nor mid/long-term pacing lead performance assessment during
      LBBP.
