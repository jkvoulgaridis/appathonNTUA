    <textblock>
      90 female patients scheduled for cancer breast surgeries will be assigned to 2 groups, each
      of 45. Group (K) will receive a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine with induction of anaesthesia,
      followed by ketamine infusion 0.12 mg/kg/hour continued till 24 hours after surgery. Group
      (KM) will receive a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine added to 50mg/kg magnesium sulfate over 30
      minutes after induction of anaesthesia, followed by ketamine infusion 0.12 mg/kg/hour added
      to 8mg/kg/hour of magnesium sulfate continued till 24 hours after surgery. The same
      anaesthetic regimen will be applied to all patients. Total intraoperative fentanyl required
      to maintain mean blood pressure within 20% of its baseline will be recorded. After surgery,
      all patients will be connected to PCA device containing morphine solution, the amount of
      morphine consumed during the first 24 hours will be recorded. In the follow-up visits after 3
      months, all patients will be assessed for neuropathic pain by DN4 questionnaire.

    <masking_description>The study medications were prepared by a pharmacist who was not involved in the patient management or the data collection. Both the patients and the stuff involved in their management were unaware of the group assignment. Equal rates of the drug infusion and equal volumes of the administered drugs were applied to all patients to ensure double blinding of the study.</masking_description>

    <description>After transferring to post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), the IV route of each patient will be connected to a PCA device containing morphine solution (1mg/ml). This PCA device will be set to deliver a demand dose of 1ml with a lockout interval of 15 minutes and without a continuous background infusion.
The primary outcome in this study will be assessed in the form of the total amount of morphine required during the first postoperative 24 hours.</description>
