  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy (CT) is a frequent and well established treatment in women with breast and
      gynecological tumors. Alopecia is one of the most common side effects of CT seriously
      impairing patient quality of life and body image. While other CT associated side effects can
      be controlled by supportive treatment strategy, adequate preventive measures for alopecia
      have been lacking. New evidence supports the efficacy of scalp cooling for alopecia
      prevention during CT.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scalp cooling using cooling caps has been identified as an effective treatment option against
      CT-induced alopecia in numerous European countries. Originally, crashed ice was used to cause
      vasoconstriction and consequently diminish CT uptake to hair follicles during CT. Soon, this
      method turned out impractically and has been displaced by cooling caps which allow a constant
      cooling of the scalp while easy handling.

      However, effectiveness of scalp cooling depends on different factors such as hair texture,
      chemotherapy regimen, dose of chemotherapy, cooling time, and compliance of the patient.

      Recent studies focused on alopecia prevention more than on patients' quality of life and
      satisfaction. Therefore, data on routine use of cool caps with a focus on efficiency in daily
      routine and patients' acceptability are missing.

      Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide results assessed by the use of a patient's report
      about his or her own health condition &quot;without amendment or interpretation by a clinician or
      anyone else&quot; and are a valuable source of information when evaluating clinical interventions
      or treatment toxicity in intervention studies in oncology. PROs can be perfectly used to
      evaluate the implication of scalp cooling regarding hair preservation but also quality of
      life outcome which seems even more important.

      Women with breast- or gynecological cancer receiving taxane- or anthracycline-based
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy are included in the study. Chemotherapy can be neoadjuvant, adjuvant
      or palliative. Up to two lines of chemotherapy are allowed. Scalp cooling with a maintenance
      temperature of 17Â°C will be initiated 30 minutes prior to each chemotherapy cycle and stopped
      90 minutes after CT. Patients are assessed for alopecia and qualitiy of life.

    <description>CTCAE are descriptive terminology for reporting adverse events including a grading for each of these adverse events.

    <description>The Hairdex questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for the evaluation of quality of life in patients with hair diseases (i.e. validated in patients with alopecia diffusa and androgenica). Using a five-point Likert Scale (never=0 to always =4), the questionnaire encompasses 48 items composing the 5 subscales symptoms, functioning, emotionals, self-confidence and stigmatization. All scales range from 0-100, higher values indicate higher impairment.</description>

    <description>he EORTC QLQ-C30 Aaronson is a self-report measure consisting of 30 items with a 4 point Likert Scale response format. It targets on functioning (physical, role emotional, cognitive, and social functioning and global health/QoL scale) and symptoms (fatigue, nausea and emesis, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, financial difficulties). All scales and single items range from 0-100.</description>

    <description>The PRO-CTCAE allow the assessment of those symptoms listed in the CTCAE that can be perceived by a patient him/herself. For most items PRO-CTCAE assesses symptom severity, but for some it covers also symptom frequency and interference with daily activities. In total, this PRO instrument covers 81 symptoms with 126 items using a 5-point Likert scale for grading. For the purpose of this study, we use the PRO-CTCAE-ITEMS (Item Library Version 1.0; Version date: 3/24/2016) Symptom Term: Hair loss.</description>
