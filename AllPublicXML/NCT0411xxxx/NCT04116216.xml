  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we wondered whether patients with different phenotypes of Parkinson's disease
      respond differently to the protocol of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      associated with physical therapy. Furthermore, the study aims to compare the effects of rTMS
      protocols (high and low frequency) associated with physical therapy in PD patients with
      different phenotypes regarding to motor performance; bradykinesia; functional mobility;
      balance; quality of life; perception of improvement.

      After given prior informed consent, volunteers will be classified and randomized using a
      website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher. At study beginning, volunteers will
      be evaluated through structured questionnaire. They will be submitted to the following
      evaluations: (i) Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); (ii) Parkinson's disease
      Sleep Scale; (iii) Parkinson's disease questionnaire; (iv) Short version of Balance
      Evaluation Systems Test; (v) Timed up and go; (vi) 5-times sit to stand test; (iv) Patient
      Global Impression of Change Scale. The cortical activity of the patients will be assessed
      through electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

      Treatment - Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the following experimental
      protocols: (i) real high frequency rTMS + physical therapy protocol; (ii) real low frequency
      rTMS + physical therapy protocol; (iii) rTMS sham + physiotherapeutic protocol. The sessions
      will be performed five times a week for two weeks. Individuals allocated to the high
      frequency rTMS group will be performed the following protocol: first the coil center will be
      positioned over Cz for the first 1000 pulses. Then the coil will be moved to C4 and C3, where
      1000 pulses will be delivered to each hemisphere. The intensity will be set to 100% of the
      motor threshold. The high frequency stimulation will be delivered at 10 Hz, offered in 20
      50-pulse trains, with 30-second train intervals. The low frequency will be performed at 1 Hz.
      All groups will be treated with physical therapy immediately after rTMS.

    <description>In the present study we will analyze the UPDRS session III which comprises 14 items with a score of 0-4 each, from best to worst motor performance (SHULMAN et al., 2010). According to UPDRS scores, patients will be classified as: (i) tremor-dominant (TD) or (ii) with postural instability and difficulty in walking (PIGD).</description>

    <description>it will be evaluated through single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Initially, rest motor threshold (RMT) will be determined by finding the lowest stimulator output that elicit motor evoked potential (MEP) around 50 μV (TMS Motor Threshold Assessment Tool -MTAT 2.0 - USA For RMT measure, a figure-eight coil connected to the magnetic stimulator held manually at 45 degrees from the midline, will be placed over the primary motor cortex of most and less impaired hemisphere (C3 and C4 - 10/20 System).</description>
