      The objective of this pilot study is to collect preliminary data using total body scans on a
      new, first of its kind, FDA 510k-cleared positron emission tomography/computed tomography
      (PET/CT) scanner, called EXPLORER.

    <description>10 mCi of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) will be injected through the IV and a 60-minute dynamic scan will begin on EXPLORER. The IV line will be removed after dynamic acquisition. The dynamic scan will be preceded by ultra low-dose (1.298 mSv) CT scan to provide information for attenuation correction for the PET data. At 90 minutes, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-hours, a static whole-body scan for 20 minutes will be acquired on EXPLORER. Prior to the 90-minute scan a low-dose CT (7.44 mSv) will be obtained both for anatomic localization and for attenuation correction purposes. Prior to each of the later time-points (3-, 6-, 9- and 12-hours), an ultra low-dose (1.298 mSv) CT scan will be acquired. This scan will be for attenuation correction purposes only. Following the 12-hour scan, the participant's study visit will be completed. MRI Brain will be also obtained after PET/CT scanning for anatomic correlation.</description>

    <description>0.5 mCi of 18F-FDG (1/20th of the standard dose) will be hand injected through the IV and a 60-minute dynamic scan will begin on EXPLORER. The dynamic scan will be preceded by an ultra-low-dose CT scan (1.298 mSv) for attenuation correction. The standard 20-minute EXPLORER scan obtained at 90 minutes will be obtained after a low dose CT (7.44 mSv) for attenuation and co-localization. The standard 20-minute EXPLORER scan obtained at 3 hours will be preceded by an ultra-low-dose CT scan (1.298 mSv) for attenuation correction only. MRI Brain will be also obtained after PET/CT scanning for anatomic correlation.</description>

    <description>10 mCi of 18F-FDG will be hand injected through the IV and a 60-minute dynamic scan will begin on EXPLORER. Prior to the dynamic scan, an ultra-low-dose CT scan (1.298 mSv) will be acquired for attenuation correction purposes only. At 90 mins, a low dose non contrast enhancement CT (7.44 mSv) will be acquired vertex to toes. Iodinated contrast (150 cc of iodine Omnipaque 350) will then be intravenously injected (through the same IV placed to inject FDG) at 3 ml/sec while the patient remains still on the scanner and a second low-dose CT will be acquired. Finally, a 20-minute PET acquisition will be performed. The IV line will be removed after completion of the study. MRI Brain will be also obtained after PET/CT scanning for anatomic correlation.</description>
