    <textblock>
      The effect of different physical exercise protocols on inflammatory markers, antioxidant
      balance, and metabolomics has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this study
      is to investigate the responses of oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and metabolomics
      to exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the major causes of morbidity and
      mortality, is a preventable and curable disease characterized by irreversible airflow
      limitation. The progressive lung involvement, systemic inflammation, respiratory and
      peripheral muscle dysfunction, loss of muscle mass, and the dysfunction of the remaining
      muscles occur in COPD. Muscle dysfunction, which is defined as loss of strength or loss of
      endurance characteristics in muscles, is a comorbidity associated with poor outcomes such as
      frequent hospitalization and decreased survival, as well as adversely affecting exercise
      capacity and quality of life. Exercise increases mitochondrial activity and requires
      antioxidant defense to achieve cellular redox regulation. The effect of different physical
      exercise protocols on inflammatory markers, antioxidant balance, and metabolomics has not
      been fully elucidated. Oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and metabolic responses to
      different acute exercise modalities in COPD patients need to be examined and clarified.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the responses of oxidative stress,
      inflammatory markers, and metabolomics to exercise. Detection of biomolecules that change
      with acute exercise may also contribute to the identification of exercise-related pathways.
