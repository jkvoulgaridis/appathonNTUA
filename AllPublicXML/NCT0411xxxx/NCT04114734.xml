  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate ParkRx, a clinic-based counseling
      intervention in which health care providers prescribe park visits at a specific frequency,
      duration, and includes instructions for physical activity in the parks. We will assess
      whether prescribing visits to specific parks changes physical activity levels and improves
      health and mental health outcomes among low-income pediatric patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Park prescriptions are formal clinical encouragements for patients to engage in more physical
      activity outdoors. From the beginning, ParkRx has been perceived as a common-sense solution
      to physical inactivity and to increasing the time children might be spending outdoors in
      nature. In spite of a lack of rigorous evidence that it is effective, the ParkRx concept is
      currently being widely disseminated and has been embraced by multiple national organizations.
      Unity Health, a federally qualified community health center in Washington, DC, is currently
      implementing park prescriptions for its largely low-income and minority population, a group
      at high risk of chronic diseases, physical inactivity and obesity. In partnership with Unity
      Health, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to prospectively evaluate
      Park Rx's impact on physical activity, as well as other secondary health outcomes in
      pediatric patients. Our specific aims are: 1) to test whether Park Rx will increase park
      visits and accelerometry-measured physical activity among children; 2) to identify any
      biological impacts of Park Rx on health, including impact on hypercholesterolemia,
      hypertriglyceridemia, HbA1C, overweight and obesity, for those patients with relevant
      diagnoses; 3) to explore impacts on mental health, including stress and measures of cognitive
      functioning; and 4) to determine whether there are age and gender differences in adherence to
      and impact of Park Rx. The results of this study will quantify the effectiveness of Park Rx
      and inform its future dissemination.
