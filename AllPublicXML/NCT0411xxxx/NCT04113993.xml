  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effect of adjunctive bazedoxifene - a selective estrogen receptor modulator
      (SERM) in a double blind, placebo-controlled adjunctive study in the treatment of women with
      schizophrenia. All patients receive standardized antipsychotic medication.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in the treatment of schizophrenia, pharmacotherapy remains sub- optimal, and
      the prognosis for many patients is poor. We have pioneered work showing that estradiol has a
      positive role in the treatment of psychosis symptoms and cognitive deficits seen in people
      with schizophrenia. However, with the longer-term work from studies such as the Women's
      Health Initiative (1), it has become clear that long-term use of estradiol with progesterone
      may have associated increased risks of breast and other cancers. Hence, we began working with
      the Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator - raloxifene, which appears to be safer for longer
      term use with respect to the development of breast and other cancers. Building on our and
      others work, raloxifene used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia appears to produce
      inconsistent and varying responses in different sub-populations; gender, menopausal status,
      age, drug dose and delivery mode. We now propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo controlled trial of a third generation SERM - bazedoxifene - which is 4 times more
      selective for the alpha than the beta oestrogen receptor subtype. Bazedoxifene appears to be
      safer with respect to long term use than older SERMs, has additional actions on the
      glucocorticoid receptor, and together this different pharmacology speculatively has greater
      potential than other SERMs to impact favorably on both psychosis symptoms and cognition in
      men and women with schizophrenia. This study will test 160 women to determine if
      bazedoxifene, as an adjunctive hormone modulator, is effective for positive and cognitive
      symptoms of schizophrenia.

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial will be conducted at two sites- the lead site is the Monash Alfred Psychiatry research Centre in Melbourne (Investigator - Prof Jayashri KULKARNI) , and a second site in Melbourne - The Monash Medical Centre (Investigator - Prof Suresh Sundram). The trial will follow the parallel comparison design consisting of two arms over 12 weeks (treatment x time).

    <description>Symptoms of schizophrenia as measured on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).
Subscales: Positive, Negative, General Psychopathology.
Positive scale: 7 Items, (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49). Negative scale: 7 Items, (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49). General Psychopathology scale:16 Items, (minimum score = 16, maximum score = 112).
PANSS Total score (summed from subscales): minimum = 30, maximum = 210
For all items, higher values indicate increased symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropsychological battery will include subtests from the following batteries:
MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) comprises 7 domains: speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving and social cognition.
The Repeatable Battery for Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) comprises 12 subtests that are used to calculate five index scores (Immediate Memory; Visuospatial/Constructional; Language; Attention and Delayed Memory) and a total score.
A verbal fluency task (Controlled Oral Word Association Task; COWAT), visual attention task (Trails A and B) and measures of premorbid intellect (Test of Premorbid Functioning; TOPF) will also be included.
Eye tracking will be an optional extra and will be recorded using The EyeLink (SR Research Ltd). Participants will fixate and/or shift their gaze in response to a number of stimuli, appearing on the screen, as requested by the assessor.</description>
