  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that the actual obesity epidemy is related to chronic overconsumption
      of added or free sugars. The increasing popularity of artificial sweeteners attest the
      population willingness to reduce added sugars intake and to use alternatives to alleviate
      health impact of free sugar overconsumption. However, recent findings suggest that artificial
      sweeteners may rather contribute to obesity epidemy and its associated adverse health
      effects, potentially via a negative impact on gut microbiota. It has been shown in various
      studies that, for the same amount of sucrose, unrefined sugars (such as maple syrup) are
      associated with favorable metabolic effects. The polyphenols contained in maple syrup,
      especially lignans, could contribute to these positive effects. Indeed, the strong impact of
      those biomolecules on the modulation of gut microbiota and on gastro-intestinal and metabolic
      health has been demonstrated in several studies. It is therefore highly relevant to test the
      hypothesis that the substitution of refined sugar by an equivalent amount of maple syrup (5%
      of daily energy intake) result in a lesser metabolic deterioration, by the modulation of
      maple syrup on gut microbiota, than the one observed with refined sugar.
