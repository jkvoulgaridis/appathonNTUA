  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Parenting Young Children Check-up (PYCC) is a 3-part system for parents of children with
      Disruptive Behavior Problems (DBPs). First, at a pediatric visit, parents complete a screener
      for DBPs and, if reported, go through a tablet-based program to receive feedback and learn
      about the PYCC. Next, parents receive text messages to connect them to further parent
      training content. Third, parent training content is delivered via a web-based resource, which
      includes videos to teach parenting skills. In this proof-of-concept trial, the investigators
      will examine the acceptability of the tablet-based program and motivation of parents to
      engage in the PYCC and use the web-based resource.

      At a pediatric visit, parents will be told about the research opportunity by a staff member
      before, during, or after their visit. There will be a flier for parents, which will be
      available for receptionists to include with in-take paperwork. If parents express openness to
      participating, a research assistant will meet with them, go over the consent form, and let
      them complete the screener. Parents will complete a demographics questionnaire and the DBP
      screener. If parents report elevated DBPs, then they will be eligible to further participate.
      If they are eligible and choose to participate, the research assistant will have them go
      through the tablet-based program. Next, they will complete a brief questionnaire asking for
      input on the PYCC. Each of these components will be completed in the Computerized
      Intervention Authoring System (CIAS). The brief questionnaire is intended to evaluate
      perceptions of 1) ease of use, 2) usefulness of the information, 3) likability, and 4)
      intentions to use the PYCC web-based resource. Items will be rated on a 0 (strongly disagree)
      to 4 (strongly agree) scale. Parents will also verbally answer 6 open-ended interview
      questions about the program and suggest improvements. Answers will be audio-recorded and
      transcribed. All participants (whether only completing the screening or both parts of the
      study) will receive a resource list as well as a list of URLs to access videos on the
      video-based content on PYCC website. An ID number will need to be entered to use the website
      and the investigators will track website use.

      This data collection is not hypothesis driven. Rather, the intent is to gather mixed methods
      feedback from parents to shape the PYCC program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived ease of use of the Parenting Young Children Check-up Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Five questionnaire items (created for this project) will tap into this outcome. Parents will be asked about perceived ease of use of each part of the program. Items will be rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Definitely Disagree, 4 = Definitely Agree); higher scores will indicate more perceived ease of use. Responses (n and % for each response option) will be reported for each item. Additionally, an average ease of use score will be computed by taking the mean of the 5 responses (range of 0 [Definitely Disagree] to 4 [Definitely Agree]; higher scores indicate more ease of use).
Additionally, two oral interview questions will tap into perceived ease of use. These oral items will be coded for specific comments related to ease of use.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived usefulness of the information in the Parenting Young Children Check-up Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Seven questionnaire items (created for this project) will tap into this outcome. Parents will be asked about how useful they perceive each part of the program. Items will be rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Definitely Disagree, 4 = Definitely Agree); higher scores will indicate more perceived usefulness. Responses (n and % for each response option) will be reported for each item. Additionally, an average perceived usefulness score will be computed by taking the mean of the 7 responses (range of 0 [Definitely Disagree] to 4 [Definitely Agree]; higher scores indicate more perceived usefulness).
Additionally, two oral interview questions will tap into perceived usefulness. These oral items will be coded for specific comments related to usefulness of the program.</description>

    <measure>Likeability of the Parenting Young Children Check-up Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Four questionnaire items (created for this project) will tap into this outcome. Parents will be asked about how much they like each part of the program. Items will be rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Definitely Disagree, 4 = Definitely Agree); higher scores will indicate more likability. Responses (n and % for each response option) will be reported for each item. Additionally, an average likability score will be computed by taking the mean of the 4 responses (range of 0 [Definitely Disagree] to 4 [Definitely Agree]; higher scores indicate more likability).
Additionally, two oral interview questions will tap into perceived usefulness. These oral items will be coded for specific comments related to likability of the program.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intentions to use the Parenting Young Children Check-up web-based resource</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Two questionnaire items (created for this project) will tap into this outcome. Parents will be asked about their intentions to use the web-based resource (i.e., videos on the website). For each of the two items, responses will be on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Definitely Disagree, 4 = Definitely Agree). Responses (n and % for each response option) will be reported for each item. Additionally, one oral questionnaire item will tap into this outcome; coding will reflect what percent of parents are interested in using the web-based resource, what percent of parent are not interested in using the web-based resource, and what percent are unsure.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Suggestions for program improvements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>One oral interview question (&quot;Tell me your ideas about how to make the program better?') will tap into this outcome. Responses will be coded for specific suggestions.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants that use the web-based parent training resources</measure>
    <time_frame>Between baseline and 3-months after</time_frame>
    <description>All participating parents will have an ID to access web-based parent training resources. The investigators will track to see who makes use of the resources; the frequency of use (n and % of families that use the web-based resource) will be reported.</description>
