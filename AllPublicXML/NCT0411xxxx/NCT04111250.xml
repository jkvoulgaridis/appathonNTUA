  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) of split-mouth design was to compare
      patient preference and effectiveness of two different techniques for lifting the maxillary
      sinus: the crestal approach versus the lateral window approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient having bilateral edentulism in posterior maxillae was randomised to receive one
      partial fixed prosthesis supported by one to three implants placed either with a crestal or
      with lateral window sinus lift procedure.

      Eligibility criteria for participants

      Only healed implant sites were considered (at least 3 months after tooth extraction). The
      vertical bone height at the implant sites to be included had to be between 2 to 6 mm and bone
      thickness at least 6 mm as measured on cone-bean computed tomography (CBCT) scans.

      Patients were not admitted in the study if any of the following exclusion criteria was
      present:

      general contraindications to implant surgery subjected to irradiation in the head and neck
      area immunosuppressed or immunocompromised treated or under treatment with intravenous
      amino-bisphosphonates poor oral hygiene and motivation untreated periodontal disease
      uncontrolled diabetes pregnant or lactating substance abusers psychiatric problems
      unrealistic expectations lack of opposite occluding dentition/prosthesis in the area intended
      for implant placement acute or chronic infection/inflammation in the area intended for sinus
      augmentation/implant placement referred only for implant placement who cannot be
      rehabilitated and followed at the treatment centre unable to attend a 5-year post-loading
      follow-up. Smokers were included and patients were categorised into three groups according to
      what declare: i) non-smokers; ìì) moderate smokers, if smoking up to 10 cigarettes/day; iii)
      heavy smokers if smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day.

      Patients were recruited and treated in one private practice in Tirana, Albania by two
      operators: Marco Tallarico who performed all surgical interventions and Erta Xhanari who
      performed all prosthetic and maintenance procedures.

    <description>Assessed on digital periapical radiographs taken with the paralleling technique at implant placement, prosthesis delivery and 1 year after loading using a digital apparatus (CS 2100, Carestream Dental, Rochester, NY, US). In the case of a not properly readable radiograph, the radiograph was to be taken again. Radiographs were stored in a TIFF format with a 600 dpi resolution, in a personal computer. Peri-implant marginal bone levels were measured using the DFW 2.8 software for windows (Soredex, Tuusula, Finland). The software was calibrated for every single image using the known implant diameter. The distance between marginal bone level and implant/abutment junction, was measured at both mesial and distal sides to the nearest 0.01 mm and averaged. Bone level changes at single implants was averaged at sinus level and then at group level. Reference points for the linear measurements were: the coronal margin of the implant collar and the most coronal point of bone-to-implant contact.</description>

    <description>Device: iRaise Sinus Lift implant (Maxillent, Herzliya, Israel). Procedure: crestal sinus lift augmentation.
We tested crestal versus lateral approach to the sinus. Crestal approach is made by a novel device (iRaise, implant system). Lateral approach is made conventionally with gold standard procedure (lateral approach).
The iRaise Sinus Lift implant is made of Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium alloy, have a surface treated with grit blasting using an apatitic calcium phosphate media, followed by acid etching, and have an internal hexagon connection. Implants have an internal l-shape channel to allow saline and graft passage.
This implants system is made to perform crestal sinus lift procedure at the same time of the implant placement using the same device. After implant site preparation and initial implant placement, the hydraulic system is connected to the implant to allow the injection of saline and then graft the material. Then, the implant, is inserted for its full length.</description>

    <description>Conventional procedure.
Lateral approach to the sinus was made following the conventional procedure.
A window on the lateral wall of the sinus is performed according to a conventional surgical lateral approach to the sinus cavity. Graft materials is filled inside the sinus cavity. Finally, iSure implants [Maxillent] are placed, and flap is sutured.</description>
