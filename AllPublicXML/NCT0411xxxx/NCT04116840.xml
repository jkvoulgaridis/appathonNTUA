    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of MT1002 for injection following
      intravenous bolus/infusion ascending dose administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 36 subjects (6 subjects per cohort) in 6 dose levels . At each dose level, a
      single sentinel subject will be dosed first. Sentinel subjects will receive a phone call at
      48 hours ±4 hours to inquire about their status. If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed for
      48 hours post-dose, the remaining 5 subjects in that dose level will be treated.

             urine pregnancy test at check-in on Day -1. All women must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception during the study and for 30 days following the end-of-study
             visit. Accepted methods of contraception include: mechanical products (e.g.,

          7. Male subjects must agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception (condom
             plus spermicide) during heterosexual intercourse from clinic admission until 30 days
             following the end of study visit.

             for collecting blood samples.

          3. Has participated in an investigational drug study and received investigational drug
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit or
