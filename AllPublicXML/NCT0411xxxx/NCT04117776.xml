  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and duration of the skin decolonization
      brought by a daily wash using Chlorhexidine Gluconate 2% pad compared to a standard wash with
      mild soap in children hospitalized in intensive care unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin is a major reservoir of pathogenic bacteria and intensive care unit patients are
      particularly vulnerable to variations in skin colonization and so to infections. These
      bacterial skin colonizations can contaminate other patients, nursing staff or even samples,
      but above all they are an endogenous source of infection of material. These bacterial skin
      colonizations hold therefore a major place in the responsibility of infections associated
      with care and can potentially affect the length of patient hospitalization. 2% Chlorhexidine
      Gluconate pads have already demonstrated a real efficacy in the sustainable reduction of
      central venous catheter-related bacteremias in adults and in children, probably through a
      reduction of cutaneous microbial colonization. However, this hypothesis remains to be
      confirmed.

      Patients in the pediatric surgical intensive care unit of Necker-Enfants Malades hospital are
      minors, hospitalized in critical and continuous surgical surveillance unit, for all surgical
      specialties excluding cardiac surgery. The use of central venous catheters concerns
      approximately 60% of the hospitalization days identified each year. To control
      catheter-related bacteremias, all intensive care unit patients are subjected to a service
      protocol since 2015, which defines a mild soap daily wash in patients without central venous
      catheter and a wash with Chlorhexidine in patients with central venous catheter. Successive
      standardized samples will be carried out on the skin of the children submissive to both types
      of washes during their hospitalization in intensive care unit.
