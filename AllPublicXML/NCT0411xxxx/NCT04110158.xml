      Childhood constipation is a frequently overlooked global health problem, which is developing
      in a public health issue in many parts of the world.(1) Constipation is one of the commonest
      digestive complaints in children(2) Constipation has long been considered a symptom, rather
      than a disease(3)

      It is often perceived as infrequent motions or passage of hard stools. Some defined
      constipation as less than 3 bowel motions per week)4(

      or as difficulty in passing stools (5) Approximately 0.5% of school children have defecation
      frequency less than 3 per week and 0.3% have fecal incontinence(6) Furthermore, 20% of
      children also have at least 1 clinical feature of constipation.7 Therefore, it is important
      to use diagnostic criteria based on multiple symptoms to define constipation
