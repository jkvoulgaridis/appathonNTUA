        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with metastatic RCC with clear cell histology

             a. The patient may have been initially diagnosed with Stage IV or initially diagnosed
             at an earlier stage and progressed to having disease at distant sites (i.e.,
             metastatic disease)

          2. Initiated first-line treatment for metastatic RCC with sunitinib on the 4/2 schedule
             (all countries) or initiated first-line treatment for metastatic RCC with sunitinib on
             the 2/1 schedule (Brazil only)

          3. Switched to the 2/1 schedule (all countries) or initiated the 2/1 schedule (Brazil
             only) during the first treatment line between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2018 a.
             The final dates defining this selection period will be dependent on country-specific
             ethics and reporting requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Evidence of other malignant neoplasms (except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in
        situ) within 5 years before switching to the sunitinib 2/1 schedule (all countries) or
