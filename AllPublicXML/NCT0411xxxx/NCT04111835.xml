  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIPPOPROJECT is a randomized healthcare study nested in the OCCSP in Poland. This project
      will assess the performance of the new screening test (HR HPV test) before its implementation
      in Poland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study assumes randomized assumption of 33,000 women aged 30-59 to cytology or HR HPV test
      in a 1:1 ratio with age stratification (three strata: 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 years).

      The study will start on September 2019 at the Department of Cervical Cancer Prevention at the
      Maria Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. To obtain results
      representative for the entire country several sites are planned for inclusion in the study
      from 2020 in 6 regions of Poland.

      Primary end-points include the detection rate of histologically confirmed high grade
      intraepithelial lesions or worse in each screening arm. Selected secondary endpoints include
      detection rate ratios, colposcopy referral rates and positive predictive values of referral
      for colposcopy.

      The study has been approved by a local bioethics committee.

    <description>According to current Polish guidelines:
ASC-US: repeat Pap testing in 6 months - current standard protocol
LSIL - repeat Pap testing in 6 months or refer for colposcopy (by the decision of cytologist) - current standard protocol
ASC-H and higher and all glandular lesions - refer for colposcopy - current standard protocol
Colposcopy-targeted biopsies will be taken in agreement with national guidelines.
If screening cytology is negative -&gt; rescreening after 3 years.</description>
