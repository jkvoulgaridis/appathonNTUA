  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of mortality in the surrounding countries.
      Once a coronary event is over, there is a high risk of readmission, recurrence and,
      mortality, attributed to a sub-optimal control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF),
      highlighting the need to improve secondary prevention strategies aimed at changing lifestyle
      and therapeutic adherence. Preventive measures should be initiated during hospitalization as
      recommended by the clinical guidelines. The objective of this study is to evaluate, through a
      randomized controlled clinical trial, the effect of an intervention based on a web
      application of health (e-Health) on lifestyle (diet, physical activity and tobacco
      consumption) and medication adherence in people with coronary heart disease after
      percutaneous coronary intervention.

      The sample will consist of 240 participants, 120 in the intervention group and 120 in the
      usual care group that will be evaluated at the beginning and nine months after hospital
      discharge regarding sociodemographic, clinical, CVRF, lifestyle and therapeutic adherence
      characteristics. The educational intervention, monitoring and self-monitoring will be carried
      out using a web-based e-Health tool, mobile phone application. The quantitative primary
      results will be compared between the two groups using ANCOVA adjusting for age and sex.
      Multivariate analysis will be carried out to examine the association of the intervention with
      life habits, control of CVRF, as well as with the evolution after discharge in respect of
      cardiovascular events, emergency and re-entry views.
