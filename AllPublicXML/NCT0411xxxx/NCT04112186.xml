    <textblock>
      In this study, neuroimaging of reward processing, drug cue reactivity and inhibitory control
      is used before and immediately after 8 weeks of two types of group therapy in individuals
      with opioid addiction; clinical outcomes will be assessed before, immediately and three
      months after treatment. Results could point to factors that track and predict recovery with
      treatment, offering clinicians markers that can be used for enhancing precision medicine with
      the goal of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with opiate addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 15 years, the US has been affected by increasing prescription and illicit
      opiate/opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose. Research into the enhancement of treatment
      options for individuals with opiate/opioid use disorder (iOUD) is clearly a priority. The
      development of neuroscience-informed behavioral therapies that could be used as adjuncts to
      improve effectiveness of medication-assisted interventions in iOUD is a national priority, a
      response to the opiate crisis. This study measures the neural correlates of cognitive
      function and reward processing as potentially contributing to and predictive of the impact of
      an 8-week group therapy on addiction outcome in iOUD. Using a pre-post randomized treatment
      design with a 3-months follow-up, this study will examine the impact of group therapy, as
      add-on to methadone maintenance, on neural functional and structural plasticity, and clinical
      outcomes (including daily ecological momentary assessments), in treatment-seeking iOUD (with
      primary use of heroin). Treatment-seeking iOUD will be randomized to 8-weeks of one of two of
      group therapies and scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) immediately before and
      after treatment. Healthy controls will be scanned at similar time intervals. Clinical outcome
      will be assessed during, immediately after and 3-months after therapy. Results may help
      identify individual variability in the brain regions/circuits that support reward processing,
      including cue reactivity, and inhibitory control and that could change with, and predict,
      response to treatment, ultimately contributing to precision medicine in OUD.

    <intervention_model_description>Individuals with opiate use disorder (iOUD) will be randomized to one of two 8-weeks of group therapy and scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) immediately before and after treatment. Functional MRI (fMRI) scans during select tasks and at rest will assess responsiveness and connectivity of neural networks underlying impairments in Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA). Structural MRI will assess the morphological integrity of the neural networks. A follow-up visit will take place 3 months after the second MRI scan.
Healthy controls will be scanned at similar time intervals. Data collected from healthy control subjects will be used for comparative analyses.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The PI and the majority of study personnel, including the study statistician, will be blinded to the treatment assignment until the database is unlocked. Assessors (of endpoints) will also be blinded to treatment assignment. That is, treatment allocation will only be known by selected research associates who are not involved in assessment or treatment. The selected research associates who are unblinded will handle randomization and preparation of any unblinded reports (if required); they will not have access to the data and no involvement in data monitoring or analyses.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal acquired during resting-state functional connectivity at the 2nd MRI conducted immediately after the 8-week group therapy (about 3 months after enrollment) as compared to baseline MRI. This method captures the synchronicity of low-frequency, spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level-dependent signals that reflect fluctuations in neuronal activity between brain regions in the absence of external stimulation.</description>
