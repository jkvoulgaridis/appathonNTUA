      Study objectives: To report feasibility data for safety and effectiveness of the study
      device.

      Study device: Nine Continents Medical implantable tibial nerve stimulator (ITNS) model 9C-680
      with programmer model 9C-580.

      Intended use: The study device is intended for treatment of the symptoms of overactive
      bladder (OAB), including urinary urge incontinence and significant symptoms of
      urgency-frequency alone or in combination, in patients who have failed or could not tolerate
      more conservative treatments.

      Type of design: Single-arm longitudinal design.

      Study sites: Single site, in the United States.

      Study duration: One year total, comprising six months for enrolling and implanting 10
      subjects, and 26 weeks for follow-up.
