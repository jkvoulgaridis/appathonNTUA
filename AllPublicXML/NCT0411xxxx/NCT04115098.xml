    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and non selective
      COX inhibitors with respect to the extent to which disease activity is improved without self
      reported, unacceptable side effects among individual patients with axial spondyloarthritis
      (AxSpA),to compare selective COX-2 and nonselective COX inhibitors impact on Health related
      Quality of Life (HrQOL) and how this relates to changes in disease activity and to conduct
      proteomic assessment of predictive biomarkers of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID)
      response
