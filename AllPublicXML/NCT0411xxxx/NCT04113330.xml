      The primary objective of the study is to identify any suspected dengue case in subjects that
      received at least one dose of the CYD dengue vaccine who were classified as seronegative or
      undetermined at baseline (according to PRNT50 at baseline, or anti-non-structural protein 1
      [NS1] test Post-dose 3) in the Colombian study sites of CYD15, CYD13, CYD29, CYD64, CYD65
      trials in order to allow appropriate access to care until the completion of 10 years after
      the last CYD Dengue Vaccine received by each participant

      The planned duration of each participant's participation in the study will vary according to
      the date when they received their last CYD Dengue Vaccine. The surveillance will last during
      10 year after the last CYD dengue vaccination of included participants
