  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to test the safety and feasibility of using transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the penile nerves to reduce intra-vaginal ejaculatory
      latency time in men with delayed ejaculation (DE). We hypothesize that this type of
      stimulation, either before or during sexual activity, will reduce latency time. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine if TENS of the penile nerve helps men with DE
      subjectively reduce their ejaculatory latency time. The secondary objective is to determine
      whether their International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score improves with treatment.

    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be surveyed before testing the device and then at the conclusion of the trial to assess for mean changes in International Index of Erectile Function which is a validated multidimensional scale for erectile function and ejaculatory function in men. The questionnaire consists of 15 questions with a scale for each from 0-5 (highest score 75, lowest score 0). The higher the score, the better the outcome and vice versa.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked about treatment related adverse events via Qualtrics survey at the conclusion of the study. Additionally, participants will be contacted every 2 weeks for check in at which time they will also be asked.</description>

    <description>The electrode pads of the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS 7000) will be placed at the base of the penis (and perineum). Participants will be able to use the device prior to sexual activity (immediately before sexual encounter for 10 minutes or daily for up to 14 days prior) to &quot;prime&quot; their system or during sexual activity. Each participant will use the device these three separate ways for 6 weeks each (total of 18 weeks of use).</description>
