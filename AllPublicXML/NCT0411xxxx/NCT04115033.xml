  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given recent increasing opioid-related deaths and evidence showing against the use of opioids
      for non-malignant chronic pain, there is growing need for non-narcotic pain management.
      Fibromyalgia is a difficult to treat chronic pain condition that is often treated with
      opioids despite existing evidence. The prevalence of fibromyalgia is increased among Veterans
      returning from the gulf war and is already a significant burden in senior Veterans who may
      have suffered with chronic pain for decades already. Many treatment options for fibromyalgia
      carry intolerable side effects. CES (Cranial Electrical Stimulation) is a FDA-approved,
      non-pharmacologic therapy that is currently utilized within the military and VA system, but
      sufficient evidence regarding its outcomes and neural mechanisms have not been adequately
      investigated. An understanding of its neural underpinnings and analgesic effects could lead
      to 1) improvements in pain management and quality of life, 2) cost-savings and 3) development
      of new techniques to address pain.

      RESEARCH PLAN: In the setting of the opioid epidemic, it is crucial to develop
      non-pharmacologic treatments for pain and biomarkers to accurately assess pain treatment
      outcomes. In the present investigation, the investigators assess a novel non-pharmacologic
      approach to chronic pain treatment in patients suffering from fibromyalgia (a notoriously
      difficult to treat pain syndrome), utilizing neuroimaging as a biomarker. Resting state
      functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), a specific neuroimaging technique, has emerged as a
      reliable research tool to objectively assess, understand, and predict clinical pain in
      syndromes such as fibromyalgia. Preliminary results reveal a trend towards improved pain and
      function with a FDA-approved, non-pharmacologic therapy - auricular Cranial Electrical
      Stimulation (CES) - over standard therapy control, correlating to altered network
      connectivity on rs-fcMRI. CES-related improvements continued through 12 weeks following the
      completion of treatment and correlated to changes in cross-network connectivity, which
      differed between groups. OBJECTIVE: The proposed CDA-2, a randomized, sham-controlled trial
      of auricular CES, evaluates 1) the clinical utility of CES for fibromyalgia as compared to
      sham placebo control, 2) short- and long-term CES-related neural changes visualized on
      rs-fcMRI and 3) the ability of rs-fcMRI to predict CES treatment response. HYPOTHESIS: True
      CES results in non-placebo-related short- and long-term pain and functional improvements that
      can be correlated with altered connectivity and predicted by baseline rs-fcMRI. METHODS:
      Fifty total subjects (male and female Veterans, age 20-60 years old) will be randomized to
      either sham (n=25) or true (n=25) auricular CES. Neuroimaging data, self-reported pain, and
      function will be assessed at baseline and at 1 and 12 weeks post-treatment to evaluate neural
      correlates of CES-related treatment. Subjects who meet study criteria will receive baseline
      assessments including rs-fcMRI, Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) measures,
      PROMIS measures, arm curl, 30-s chair stand, handgrip strength tests, and baseline analgesic
      consumption. Subjects will be block-randomized, stratified based on gender, to either true or
      sham CES (series of 4, weekly) treatments and assessed for rs-fcMRI and functional changes at
      1 and 12 weeks post-treatment. This study addresses the critical need to identify and
      understand neural correlates of pain and non-opioid pain management.

    <description>For subjects with fibromyalgia, clinical pain will be assessed in both groups using the Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), a validated measurement tool for pain, as well as analgesic consumption. Clinical pain will be measured at baseline, 1 week following treatment, and 12 weeks following treatment completion in both groups. The DVPRS is a combination of several different pain scales including the VAS, verbal rating scale, FACES scale, and numerical rating scale. Measurements will be graded on a scale of 0-10 with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;worst pain.&quot;</description>

    <description>Veterans with fibromyalgia who meet study criteria and are randomized to the experimental group will receive standard therapy in addition to cranial electrical stimulation (CES), which involves transfer of current from the alpha-stim device using earclip electrodes. The intention of this FDA-approved device is to relieve pain, though data on its effectiveness is still limited. The treatments can be self administered by the participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be male and female Veterans age 20-60 with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia
             as diagnosed by a clinician, by chart review, and by the most recent American College
             of Rheumatology 2010 criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

          -  Subjects must self-report consistent, daily pain (greater than 5 on the VAS) &gt;90 days.

          -  Subjects must have intact skin free of infection at the site of electrode placement.

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate and understand the consent.

          -  Subjects must be right-handed in order to provide consistency in brain structure and
             function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must not be currently pregnant, since effects of fMRI and electrical current
             on the developing fetus are not well-known.

          -  Subjects must not have an implanted electrical device such as a vagal stimulator,
             pacemaker, or spinal pain pump, which are not compatible with MRI.

          -  Subjects must not have a history of seizures or neurologic condition that may alter
             the structure of the brain.

          -  Subjects must not have a history of drug abuse or severe, uncontrolled psychiatric
             illness such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation.

          -  Subjects must not have psoriasis vulgaris or other skin conditions that may increase
             the risk of infection at the implantation site.

          -  Subjects must not have severe anxiety, claustrophobia, or other conditions that may
             prevent their ability to lie at rest in an MRI scanner. This will be determined after
             discussion with the patient regarding their own perceived ability to lie at rest in an
             MRI scanner without the use of additional sedating medications.

          -  Subjects must not introduce new medications or treatments for fibromyalgia symptoms
             during the course of the study to prevent confounding results.
