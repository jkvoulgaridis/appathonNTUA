      Perampanel is a drug used to treat patients with epilepsy/seizures. This study is designed to
      determine how much perampanel actually crosses the blood brain barrier into the cerebral
      spinal fluid when the drug is taken.

      Perampanel is a drug used to treat patients with epilepsy/seizures. This study is designed to
      determine how much perampanel actually crosses the blood brain barrier into the cerebral
      spinal fluid when the drug is taken.

      During a routinely scheduled neurosurgical procedure, one to two mL of cerebral spinal fluid
      will be obtained from the subarachnoid space of the brain. Five mL of arterial blood will
      also be drawn from the patients arterial line during their procedure. The blood samples and
      cerebral spinal fluid samples will be compared to see how much perampanel is in the blood
      versus the cerebral spinal fluid.

    <description>For group 1 the PER dose will be administered 2-14 hours prior to sample collection. They will be administered a single dose of PER (4 mg, 6 mg or 8mg) followed by 4 mg/day for 14 days starting on postoperative day 1 (if continued prophylaxis with PER is needed).
It is anticipated that patients in group 2 will have the daily dose of PER in these individuals will range from 4 - 12 mg/day.</description>
