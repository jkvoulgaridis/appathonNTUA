  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized trial is to investigate whether the addition of a reminder app to
      standard care leads to a reduction of dermatitis and oral mucositis during
      radio(chemo)therapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head-and-neck
      (SCCHN). The primary endpoint is the rate of patients experiencing grade ≥2 radiation
      dermatitis at 60 Gy of radiotherapy. 80 patients are required per arm within the full
      analysis set. Taking into account that 5% of patients will not qualify for full analysis set,
      168 patients should be randomized. If the addition of a reminder app to standard care will
      result in a significant reduction of radiation toxicity, it could become a helpful tool for
      these patients.

      The goal of this trial is to investigate whether the addition of a reminder app to standard
      care leads to a reduction of dermatitis and oral mucositis during radio(chemo)therapy for
      locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head-and-neck (SCCHN).

      This is a randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group trial, which will compare the
      following treatments of radiation dermatitis (primary endpoint) and oral mucositis in
      patients with SCCHN: Standard care supported by a reminder app (Arm A) vs. standard care
      alone (Arm B). The primary endpoint is to investigate the rate of patients experiencing grade
      ≥2 radiation dermatitis at 60 Gy of radiotherapy, the minimum planned total dose for all
      patients receiving definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy for locally advanced SCCHN with
      curative intention. In addition, the following endpoints will be evaluated: Radiation
      dermatitis grade ≥2 at the end of radiation treatment (EOT), radiation dermatitis grade ≥3 at
      60 Gy and EOT, quality of life, pain, and radiation-induced oral mucositis grade ≥2 and grade
      ≥3 at 60 Gy and at EOT. According to sample size calculations, 80 patients are required per
      arm within the full analysis set. Taking into account that 5% of patients will not qualify
      for full analysis set, 168 patients should be randomized. The impact of the reminder app will
      be considered clinically relevant, if the rate of grade ≥2 radiation dermatitis can be
      reduced from 85% to 65%.

      If the addition of a reminder app to standard care will result in a significant reduction of
      radiation dermatitis and oral mucositis, it could become a helpful tool for patients during
      radiotherapy of for SCCHN.

    <description>This app will remind the patients four times a day to perform skin and mouth care. Instructions are given how to properly perform skin and mouth care. The patients may postpone each required care procedure for up to 2 hours. Finally, the patients are asked to state for each procedure whether or not they performed it. To increase the patients' motivation, they will earn points for each successfully performed care procedure.</description>
