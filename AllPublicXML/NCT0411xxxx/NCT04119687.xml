  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in male and female patients, 30 - 80 years of age with painful OA
      of the index knee with Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade 2 or 3. Up to three ascending doses of
      FX201 will be tested in cohorts of 5-8 patients. Each patient will only receive one injection
      of FX201. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety and guide the
      conduct of the study.

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in male and female patients, 30 - 80 years of age with painful OA
      of the index knee with Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade 2 or 3. A maximum of 24 patients will be
      enrolled (range 15 to 24).

      Up to three ascending doses of FX201 (low dose, mid dose and high dose) will be tested in
      cohorts of 5-8 patients. Each patient will only receive one injection of FX201.

      When a minimum of 4 weeks have elapsed since the last patient of the current cohort has been
      treated, all safety data will be collected and reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring
      Committee (DMC). Only after the current dose level has been judged to be safe by the DMC will
      dose escalation to the next dosing cohort occur.

             longer) (e.g., IA corticosteroid, IA hyaluronic acid, platelet rich plasma injection,
             stem cells, prolotherapy and amniotic fluid injection, etc.)

             disorder) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would preclude the use of an IA
             injection or that could compromise patient safety, limit the patient's ability to
             complete the study, and/or compromise the objectives of the study

        Note: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.
