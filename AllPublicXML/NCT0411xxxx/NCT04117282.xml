    <textblock>
      Improving the quality of gait in the diplegic children is a major concern in the
      rehabilitation program. Thirty children with spastic diplegia were distributed equally into 2
      groups, group A (control) and group B (study). Group A had received the traditional physical
      therapy program for 30 minutes and 30 minutes traditional gait training, while group B had
      received 30 minutes gait training with antigravity shoes in addition to the traditional
      exercise program for 30 minutes, percentage of stance and swing phase of gait were measured
      by 2 D gait analysis for children of both groups pre and after 3 successive months of
      treatment program, also function level of gait were assessed pre and post treatment by GMFCS
      .

    <textblock>
      Thirty children with spastic diplegia, their age ranged from 6 to 8 years old, were
      distributed equally into 2 groups: group A (control) and group B (study) They could walk with
      limitation or holding on according to GMFCS (level II &amp;III). (Palisano et al., 2008).
      Increased time for stance phase and decreased swing phase time was recorded when evaluated by
      2D gait analysis.

      Control group (A):

      The children in this group had received traditional physical therapy exercise program
      designed for those cases for 30 minutes in addition to gait training program for 30 minutes /
      day, 3 times / week for 3 successive months.

      Study group (B):

      The children in this group received the same traditional exercise program for 30 minutes in
      addition to gait training program for 30 minutes using the antigravity shoes.

      evaluation was done before and after treatment. treatment include traditional exercises for
      gait and balance for both groups in addition to use the antigravity shoes for study group.
