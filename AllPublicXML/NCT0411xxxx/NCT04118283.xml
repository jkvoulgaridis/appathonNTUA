  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain has a highly negative impact on Veterans, especially those with serious mental
      illness (SMI). Chronic pain leads to poorer mental health and physical functioning, and
      represents a critical obstacle to rehabilitation and recovery. Despite known high prevalence
      rates of chronic pain in SMI populations, there is little research to: a) evaluate
      nonpharmacological pain management strategies in this population, and b) examine directional
      relations between chronic pain and SMI symptoms. This study aims to address research and
      clinical gaps by: a) testing the feasibility and acceptability of Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy for Chronic Pain (CBT-CP) - a VA evidence-based psychotherapy for chronic pain - in
      Veterans with SMI, and b) better assessing the complex relation between chronic pain and
      psychiatric symptoms and their impact on functioning. Results from this study will inform us
      as to whether CBT-CP is feasible to implement, acceptable to Veterans with SMI, and worth
      examining in its standard or in an optimized form in a larger clinical trial.

      This research study will address critical gaps in our understanding and management of chronic
      musculoskeletal pain in Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI), addressing the following
      aims:

      Aim 1: Complete a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 45 Veterans with co-occurring
      SMI and chronic musculoskeletal pain to examine feasibility and acceptability of CBT-CP and
      preliminarily evaluate participant responses to intervention.

      Aim 1a (Primary): Determine feasibility by demonstrating adequate rates of recruitment and
      completion of and fidelity to the CBT-CP intervention as well as quality and acceptability of
      chosen assessments.

      Aim 1b (Primary): Determine acceptability by obtaining favorable ratings from satisfaction
      questionnaires and interviews.

      Aim 1c (Exploratory): Preliminarily evaluate participant responses to intervention by
      exploring changes in functioning and quality of life among Veterans randomized to the CBT-CP
      condition (n=30).

      Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of collecting EMA data to examine the temporal relationships
      among mental health symptoms, pain severity, and health-related functioning. Data will be
      collected at baseline from the 45 Veterans in the Aim 1 RCT.

      Aim 2b (Primary): Determine feasibility of this approach through adherence to the EMA call
      schedule and overall response rates.

      Aim 2a (Exploratory): Explore relationships among mental health symptoms, pain severity, and
      health-related functioning captured in real time.

      Aim 3: Complete a well-specified process evaluation to explore how to optimize CBT-CP for use
      in Veterans with SMI and chronic musculoskeletal pain in future clinical trials. This
      evaluation will integrate qualitative data from 15 interviews with Veterans in the CBT-CP
      condition, CBT-CP interventionist notes, and quantitative data from Aims 1 and 2.

    <intervention_model_description>This study involves a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 45 Veterans with co-occurring SMI and chronic musculoskeletal pain to examine feasibility and acceptability of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (CBT-CP) and preliminarily evaluate participant responses to intervention. The first 45 Veterans who pass screening will be enrolled and randomized to study condition on a rolling basis. Participants will be randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to CBT-CP:Health &amp; Wellness using permuted block randomization with randomly varying block sizes. Veterans will be randomly assigned to either CBT-CP (n = 30) or a manualized Health &amp; Wellness active control intervention (n = 15). Using an intent-to-treat framework, data will be collected from every participant during the one-week Ecological Momentary Assessment period (prior to RCT baseline assessment) and at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up regardless of attendance in their assigned condition.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Data will be collected by experienced Research Assistants (Ras) who will receive in-person training on each assessment measure. All RAs involved in the research study will conduct baseline assessments. One RA will remain blind to study condition in order to complete post-treatment and follow-up assessments. A back-up RA supplied by the VISN 5 MIRECC will be trained to conduct assessments in case the blind assessor is unblinded or in need of assistance. If the study condition becomes known, the blind assessor will stop the assessment and either the back-up RA or study PI will finish the assessment(s).</masking_description>

    <measure>West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI) - Intereference</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed following completion of the study intervention, an expected average of 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The West Haven Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI) is a 52-item questionnaire providing a comprehensive assessment of components of the chronic pain experience that are helpful for the cognitive-behavioral conceptualization of chronic pain conditions. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale. The interference subscale will be used in this study and measures the impact of pain on functioning (household chores, outdoor work, recreation activities, social activities). An average score is calculated that ranges from 0 (no interference) to 6 (extreme interference). The WHYMPI has been used with a wide range of chronic pain populations and is sensitive to change following rehabilitative interventions. The WHYMPI is used as part of the CBT-CP assessment protocol.</description>
