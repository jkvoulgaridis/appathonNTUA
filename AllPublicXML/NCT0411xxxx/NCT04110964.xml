  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using gene therapy to express active telomerase (hTERT) in human cells has the potential to
      treat many diseases related to aging, including critical limb ischemia (CLI).

      This study will entail treating subjects with hTERT delivered via transduction using AAV. The
      goal is to extend the telomeres to prevent, delay, or even reverse the development of the
      pathology of CLI. It is expected to have a direct consequence on function and quality of life
      in patients with Peripheral artery disease (PAD); in this case a subgroup of patients with
      CLI, the worst presentation of PAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with CLI who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be treated
      with a single dose of LGT delivered intravascularly (IV).

      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as &quot;Day 0.&quot; Safety and efficacy
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.

      Study objectives

      Primary: Safety and Tolerability

      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by intravenous (IV) administration.

      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy

        1. Investigate LGT's ability to deliver hTERT to human cells and lengthen telomeres.

        2. Investigate the effects of lengthening telomeres on CLI.

        3. Investigate other benefits provided by lengthening telomeres.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age of 45 years or older.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of CLI.

          3. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must be adequately informed and
             understand the nature and risks of the study and must be able to provide a signature
             and date in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          4. Women must undergo a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening assessment.

          5. Subjects, or their representatives, must be able to communicate effectively with the
             study staff.

          6. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must certify that they are able and
             willing to follow all protocol requirements and study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any
             medications, components, or excipients of the investigational product, which cannot be
             resolved by the staff conducting the study.

          2. Female subjects who are pregnant, expected to become pregnant, or lactating/nursing.

             effective contraception (e.g., hormonal and/or barrier) during their participation in
             the study.

          4. Subjects who are intolerant of, or do not wish to receive IV injections.

          5. Subjects who are currently alcoholics and/or use psychoactive substances.

          6. Subjects who cannot tolerate venipuncture and/or venous access.

          7. Subjects who have donated or had a significant loss of whole blood (480 ml or more)
             within 30 days, or donated plasma or platelets within 14 days prior to screening.

             study if in the opinion of the principal investigator, may place the subject at risk
             due to participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study or the
             subject's ability to complete the study. If more than 30 days have passed since
             participation in another clinical trial, the study staff must ensure that the subject
             has recovered from any adverse event (AE) associated with the research product used.
