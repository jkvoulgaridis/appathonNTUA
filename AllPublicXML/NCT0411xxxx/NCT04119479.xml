      Observational study of functional recovery of stroke patients after discharge from
      rehabilitation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke, are among the greatest challenges in healthcare.
      This proves the importance of neuro-rehabilitative research. Stroke research is often focused
      on the acute treatment phase as well as the inpatient rehabilitation. A remaining question is
      how do stroke patients clinically develop after being discharged from the hospital? How
      stable are the achieved rehabilitation effects and how much more clinical improvement is seen
      in the following time period, especially with regard to ICF functionality? In this
      observational longitudinal study, the current practice of neurorehabilitation will be
      investigated and the influence of motor skills, cognition, care situation, depression,
      information and fatigue on functional recovery as well as participation, autonomy and quality
      of life will be evaluated. Stroke patients will be examined at the end of rehabilitation,
      after three, six and 12 months. In addition, a group of chronic patients undergoes the same
      examinations and thereby represents a comparison group.
