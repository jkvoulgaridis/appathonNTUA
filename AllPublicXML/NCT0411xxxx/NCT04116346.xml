  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, patients are asked to fast prior to invasive cardiac procedures. There exists
      neither clear evidence nor guidance about the benefits of this.

      Hypothesis/Objective :

      To show that allowing unrestricted oral intake before a coronary interventional procedure is
      not inferior to imposing a pre-procedural fasting period, in terms of adverse events, in
      patients requiring coronary angiography or a planned or semi-urgent percutaneous coronary
      intervention.

      Method:

      The study is a prospective, monocentric, controlled, single-blind, randomized trial in two
      parallel arms. The investigating physician performing the interventional procedure and
      evaluating the safety judgment criteria will not be informed of the patient's randomization
      arm. In order to keep the blind, the medical and paramedical staff of the interventional
      cardiology room will not inquire about the fasting status of patients included in the study.

      Patients are randomized either to the pre-procedural fasting arm or to the absence of
      pre-procedural fasting.

        -  No intervention: Pre-procedural fasting is defined by the absence of ingestion of fluids
           or solid food for at least 6 hours before the examination.

        -  Experimental: free feeding and drinking until the procedure.

      Patients are followed for 4 hours after the end of the procedure at the hospital for adverse
      events (vagal discomfort, nausea, vomiting or hypoglycaemia).

      Then a follow-up will be done at day 7 after the procedure (by telephone for outpatients or
      discharged from the hospital and in the cardiology department for patients still hospitalized
      on D7) to look for the occurrence of acute renal failure or pneumonia

    <measure>Adverse events linked to oral intake before cardiac procedure: vasovagal complications or nausea or vomiting or hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Vagal reaction is defined by the presence of at least two of the following criteria occurring during the procedure or closure of the arterial approach or during the post-procedural observation phase, in the absence of other explanations:
nausea / vomiting, skin paleness, sweating
decrease in systolic pressure &lt;100mmHg (or 15% decrease in baseline if systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg baseline)
decrease in heart rate below 60 bpm (or more than 15% decrease if basal heart rate is below 60bpm) .
Nausea evaluated by interrogation; vomiting noted by the doctor or nurse
Hypoglycemia defined by the measurement of a glycemia lower than or equal to 0.70 mg / dL. This measurement is performed in the examination room at the beginning and end of the procedure on blood taken from the arterial sheath.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post procedural acute renal failure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by a 25% increase in serum creatinine compared with basal level, or an increase in serum creatinine of more than 44 μmol/l in 3 days after injection of contrast medium</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post procedural aspiration pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
