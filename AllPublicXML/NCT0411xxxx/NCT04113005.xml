  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective, Phase 1 pilot trial intended to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of adding one IV dose of Desmopressin to CRPC subjects at least 30 minutes prior
      to commencing standard IV Docetaxel treatment7,8.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following Desmopressin/Docetaxel treatment subjects will be subjected to routine medical
      oncology follow-up, including clinical appointments, laboratory and imaging workup as well as
      additional Docetaxel therapy every 21 days as indicated.

      An additional study clinical appointment with blood work will be organized two days post
      Desmopressin/Docetaxel treatment. Furthermore, for detailed documentation of AEs during the
      first 21 days following Desmopressin/Docetaxel therapy, subjects will be assessed weekly via
      phone, and in person by the investigator/treating medical oncologist before the second dose
      of docetaxel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be considered eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the

          2. Signed Informed Consent Form indicating that the subject understands the purpose of,
             and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study.

          3. Castration-resistant stage of disease about to be treated with Docetaxel.

          4. Baseline laboratory values as stated below:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L;

               2. Platelet count ≥125 x 109/L;

               3. Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal;

               4. Urea ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal;

               5. Bilirubin ≤1.1 x upper limit of normal (unless elevated secondary to conditions
                  such as Gilbert's disease);

               8. Castrate serum testosterone level (&lt; 1.7 nmol/L).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

             cardiac arrhythmia, severe hypertension, or active infection requiring systemic
             antibiotics, or any event such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or
             pulmonary embolism within 3 months prior to protocol therapy, as well as any
             significant concurrent medical illness that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             preclude protocol therapy.
