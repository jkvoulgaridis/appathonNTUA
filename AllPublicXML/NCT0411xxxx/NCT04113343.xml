      A Phase 1 Study to Determine the Single-dose Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Safety

      Evaluating the potential for additive or synergistic effects of alcohol when coadministered
      with remimazolam. Female subjects were selected because they represent the population at
      greatest risk for victimization in drug-facilitated sexual assault. In addition, females have
      a slower ethanol metabolism, therefore, the effects of remimazolam, if coadministered with
      alcohol, may last longer. Hence, this population represents the worst-case scenario in
      evaluating the risk of remimazolam misuse in drug-facilitated assault.

             ecstasy], cannabinoids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and
             alcohol) at Screening and admission to the clinical research center.

         14. Average intake of &gt; 14 drinks of alcohol per week (1 drink equals approximately 12
