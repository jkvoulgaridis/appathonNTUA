  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year follow-up of patients enrolled in a previous randomized controlled trial
      which showed that intraoperative dexmedetomidine reduced delirium in elderly patients after
      major non-cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of
      intraoperative dexmedetomidine on long-term outcomes of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α-2-receptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and
      anxiolytic effects. When used as an supplement during general anaesthesia, it reduces the
      consumption of the anaesthetics and relieves surgery-related stress response and
      inflammation. In a recent randomized ontrolled trial of the applicants, 620 elderly patients
      who underwent major non-cardiac surgery were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine or normal
      saline during general anesthesia. The results showed that use of dexmedetomidine reduced
      delirium (5.5% [17/309] with dexmedetomidine vs. 10.2% [32/310] with placebo, P=0.026) and
      30-day non-delirium complications (9.4% [60/309] with dexmedetomidine vs. 26.1% [81/310] with
      placebo, P=0.047) after surgery.

      The effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on long-term outcomes after surgery remains
      unclear. In another study of the applicants, use of low-dose dexemeditomidine in ICU patients
      after surgery increased survival up to 2 years and improve quality of life in 3-year
      survivors. On the contrary, it was reported in a retrospective study that intraoperative use
      of dexmedetomidine was associated with shortened overall survival in patients after lung
      cancer surgery. Therefore, it is urgent to clarify the impact of intraoperative
      dexemeditomidine on long-term outcomes of patients undergoing major surgery, especially those
      undergoing cancer surgery.

      This study is a 3-year follow-up of patients who were enrolled in a randomzied controlled
      trial of the applicants in order to clarify the effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on
      long-term outcomes after surgery.
