  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether intravenous ketamine followed by buprenorphine produces more rapid and
      sustained anti-suicidal effects than ketamine followed by placebo, investigators will conduct
      a single study that will take approximately 2.5 years to complete. 60 subjects (60 infusions)
      or approximately 24 infusions per year.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive buprenorphine following ketamine will
      demonstrate significantly greater anti-suicidal effects beginning at day 7 and maintained for
      the entire four weeks of the study as well as longer times to recurrence than will those who
      receive ketamine followed by placebo. As secondary analyses, the investigators will test
      whether there is a relationship of improvement in sleep and pain to change in suicide
      ratings.

      Aim 2: To assess the potential role played by the opioid properties of a single infusion of
      ketamine, investigators will for the ketamine portion determine ketamine and metabolite blood
      levels during and after the infusion as well as pupillary changes and correlate them to
      anti-suicidal response at Day 1. Investigators will also collect blood to determine
      buprenorphine blood levels, prolactin as well as collecting data on pupillary changes and
      then assess for potential relationships with anti-suicidal response.

    <description>The model will include the difference in total scores on the suicidality measure from days 3 to 31 as a within subject effect, treatment, and time, as well as time x treatment interaction. The model will include Day 3 score as well. The total scores range from 0 to 38, with higher values indicating a greater risk of suicide.All effects will use p&lt;.05 for simple effects and p=0.1 for interactions, Using a sample size of 60, the hypothesis test will be fully powered (i.e., 80%) to detect effect sizes of 0.35 or greater.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 3-31</time_frame>
    <description>peripherally by exploring opioid activity in subjects treated in the ketamine infusion and the sublingual buprenorphine vs. placebo phases by measuring serum metabolites of both ketamine and buprenorphine. The metabolites are measured in ng/mL with a reference interval of 1-10. Any presence of the drug will result in a number within the interval. If none detected, a not established level will be the result.</description>

    <description>Moreover, we will apply pupillometry to estimate opioid activity. Levels of drug and opioid activity at specific time points will be correlated with response at that time point. In addition, regression analyses will be used to assess the relative contribution of opioid activity in blood, drug blood level, and pupil measure to improvement in suicidal behavior as well as mood, pain, and insomnia. This aim is exploratory.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will be eligible for inclusion only if all of the following criteria are
             met:

               1. Male or female, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive, at screen.

               2. Able to read, understand, and provide written, dated informed consent prior to
                  screening. Participants will be deemed likely to comply with study protocol and
                  communicate with study personnel about adverse events and other clinically
                  important information.

               3. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single or recurrent, and
                  currently experiencing a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) of at least eight weeks
                  in duration, prior to screening, according to the criteria defined in the
                  Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text
                  Revision(DSM-IV-TR™). The diagnosis of MDD will be made by a site psychiatrist
                  and supported by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR™ (SCID-I/P).

               4. Has a history of TRD during the current MDE, as assessed by the investigator. TRD
                  is defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50%
                  improvement of depression symptoms), as perceived by the participant, to at least
                  two &quot;treatment courses&quot; of a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant therapy of at
                  least 8 weeks duration. The adequacy of dose and duration of the antidepressant
                  therapy will be determined as per the MGH ATRQ criteria. Participants must
                  currently be on a stable (for at least 4 weeks) and adequate (according to the
                  MGH ATRQ) dose of ongoing SSRI or SNRI antidepressant therapy, of which total
                  duration must be at least 8 weeks. Participants may also have a history of
                  intolerance to at least 2 antidepressant medications. These patients with the
                  intolerance history will not be required to be currently taking an antidepressant
                  medication.

               5. Meet the threshold on the total SSI score of &gt;/=11 at both screening and baseline
                  visits.

               6. Participants must qualify as &quot;Moderately Treatment Refractory&quot; using the Maudsley
                  staging method, which incorporates past treatments, severity of symptoms and
                  duration of presenting episode.

               7. In good general health, as ascertained by medical history, physical examination
                  (PE) (including measurement of supine and standing vital signs), clinical
                  laboratory evaluations, and 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

               8. If female, a status of non-childbearing potential or use of an acceptable form of
                  birth control per the following specific criteria:

                    1. Non-childbearing potential (e.g., physiologically incapable of becoming
                       pregnant, i.e., permanently sterilized (status post hysterectomy, bilateral
                       tubal ligation), or is post-menopausal with her last menses at least one
                       year prior to screening); or

                    2. Childbearing potential, and meets the following criteria:

                  i. Childbearing potential, including women using any form of hormonal birth
                  control, on hormone replacement therapy started prior to 12 months of amenorrhea,

                  control during the course of the study, defined as those which result in a low
                  failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly:
                  implants, injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, IUD,
                  double-barrier contraception, sexual abstinence. The form of birth control will
                  be documented at screening and baseline.

               9. Body mass index between 17-35kg/m2.

              10. Concurrent psychotherapy will be allowed if the type (e.g., supportive, cognitive
                  behavioral, insight-oriented, et al) and frequency (e.g., weekly or monthly) of
                  the therapy has been stable for at least three months prior to screening and if
                  the type and frequency of the therapy is expected to remain stable during the
                  course of the subject's participation in the study.

              11. Concurrent hypnotic therapy (e.g., with zolpidem, zaleplon, melatonin, or
                  trazodone) will be allowed if the therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks
                  prior to screening and if it is expected to remain stable during the course of
                  the subject's participation in the study.
