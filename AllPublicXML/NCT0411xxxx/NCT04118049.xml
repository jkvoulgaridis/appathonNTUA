  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are evaluating the effect of vaginal probiotics on the
      bothersome side effects of pessary use and the impact on the vaginal microenvironment
      (lactobacilli, anaerobic bacteria, mobiluncus bacteria, WBCs, cellular debris, epithelial
      cells, and BVAB-1), and inflammatory environment (cytokines).
