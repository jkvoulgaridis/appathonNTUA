          7. Healthy status was defined by the absence of evidence of any clinically significant,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, active or chronic disease following a detailed
             medical and surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs,
             12-lead ECG, hematology, clinical chemistry, serology, and urinalysis.

          8. Ability and willingness to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and xanthine-containing
             beverages or food (eg, coffee, tea, cola, chocolate, energy drinks) from 48 hours (2
             days) prior to admission to the clinical facility on Day -1 until study discharge.

          9. All values for hematology and for clinical chemistry tests of blood and urine within
             the normal range or showing no clinically relevant deviations as judged by the
             Investigator.

         10. Females of childbearing potential and males and their female partner(s) of
             childbearing potential had to agree to use 2 forms of contraception, 1 of which had to
             be a barrier method, during the study and for 90 days after the last drug
             administration. Acceptable barrier forms of contraception were condom and diaphragm.
             Acceptable non-barrier forms of contraception for this study were an intrauterine
             device (IUD) and/or spermicide.

             serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 IU/L at Screening.

         13. All non-regular medication (including over-the-counter [OTC] medication, health
             supplements, and herbal remedies such as St. John's Wort extract) must have been
             stopped at least 14 days prior to admission to the clinical research center. An
             exception was made for paracetamol (acetaminophen), which was allowed up to admission
             to the clinical research center.

          5. Known allergy, hypersensitivity or prior intolerance to benzodiazepine derivates or
             flumazenil, or a medical condition such that these agents were contraindicated.

          6. The use of tobacco products within 60 days prior to the first drug administration.

          7. Routine or chronic use of more than 3 grams of acetaminophen daily.

         10. Plasma or platelet donation within 7 days of dosing and throughout the entire study.

         11. History of alcohol consumption exceeding 2 standard drinks per day on average (1
             standard drink = 10 grams of alcohol). Alcohol consumption was prohibited from 48

             until discharge.

         12. Positive screening test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C

             Day -1.

         14. Positive results for alcohol abuse, as determined by alcohol breath test, at Screening
             or Day -1.
