  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation of the genicular nerves using ultrasound is safe and effective for
      treating intractable knee osteoarthritis pain by using either monopolar or bipolar
      radiofrequency ablation.

      This technique is based on anatomical studies demonstrating that genicular nerves are
      accompanied by genicular arteries. Ultrasound-guided RF genicular ablation yielded both
      significant reductions in knee pain and improvements in functional capacity.

      The aim of this study is to compare between ultrasound guided monopolar and bipolar
      radiofrequency ablation in chronic knee osteoarthritis.

      Osteoarthritis of knee joint is one of the most common disease conditions with advanced age
      and leads to considerable morbidity in terms of pain, stiffness, limitation in functions,
      disturbance in sleep and psychological disturbance

      A diagnostic genicular nerve block (GNB) with local anesthetic is performed before RF
      genicular ablation, and a successful response to GNB is considered to indicate the need for
      RF genicular ablation

    <description>a radiofrequency cannula is advanced under USG guidance towards the nerve. The final position will be confirmed by using nerve stimulator with elicitation of paraesthesia along the area of knee joint supplied by that respected genicular nerve by stimulation at 50 Hz current of &lt;0.5 mV. The motor stimulation will be negative at all instances. For each genicular nerve, two conventional RF lesions are done for 120s at 80° of temperature using the Neurotherm 1100 RF generator.</description>
