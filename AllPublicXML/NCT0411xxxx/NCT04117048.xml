      This study evaluates the impact of using LabPad® point-of-care to measure International
      Normalized Ratio (INR) at home on the patient's follow up on vitamine K antagonist (VKA)
      treatment during 6 months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of the LabPad® point-of-care use by the nurse will be evaluated in the patients on
      vitamine K antagonist (VKA) treatment by measuring the time elapsed between the reading of
      the International Normalized Ratio (INR) by the LabPad® at patient's home and the validation
      of the biological measure, The time that the patient spends in his therapeutic range will be
      measured. The adverse events related to VKA will also be collected. At the end of the study,
      the patient will complete satisfaction and usage questionnaires about the LabPad®.

      This study will be performed for 6 months.
