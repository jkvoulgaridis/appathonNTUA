  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 21% to 35% of people with limb loss are those who lost their limb at trans-femoral
      level (i.e. above the knee). The increasing number of diabetes-related limb loss (amputation)
      and the rising proportion of older adult amputees indicates more amputees with limited
      mobility in the future. Among other factors, prosthesis success highly depends on the
      function of the knee joints during daily activities.

      Presently, there are two categories of prosthetic knee joints; microprocessor-controlled
      knees (MPKs) and non-microprocessor-controlled knees (n-MPKs). Whilst the n-MPKs are unable
      to change the knee stiffness, the MPKs alter the joint stiffness and speed of movement
      according to the users' walking speed.

      Although past studies indicate that MPKs could result in reduced risk of falls, improved
      balance and activity in limited mobility amputees, there is a lack of strong evidence on the
      effect of MPKs on community outcomes. The aim of this study is to compare activity, mobility,
      social functioning, depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life in limited
      mobility trans-femoral or through-knee (i.e. knee disarticulation) amputees who are users of
      MPKs prosthesis with users of a prosthesis with n-MPKs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 Quality of Life (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a validated generic measure of health-related quality of life consisting of eight scales (physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Special Interest Group in Amputee Medicine (SIGAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>SIGAM describe a single-item scale comprising six clinical grades (A -F) of amputee mobility. SIGAM is a self-report questionnaire with 21 dichotomous (Y/N) items and algorithm designed to facilitate grade assignment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ); Mobility, Social Burden and Residual Limb Health Subscales.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>These scales contain 22 questions (Mobility and transfer, n=13; social burden, n=3, residual limb health, n=6) using the visual analog scales. The PEQ is a valid and reliable measure of the prosthetic related quality of life. It consisted of nine sub-scales, which are not dependent on each other.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>RNLI measures the degree to which people with traumatic or incapacitating illness reintegrate into normal social activities (e.g. recreation, movement in the community, and interaction in the family or other relationships). Respondents rate 11 questions on Visual Analogue Scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS scale is used to measure the level of anxiety and depression a person experiencing. It comprises 14 items on the four-point Likert scale; Seven items on anxiety and seven items on depression.</description>
