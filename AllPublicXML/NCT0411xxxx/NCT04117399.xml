    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease that results in
      progressive airflow limitation and respiratory distress. Physiopathological features of COPD
      suggest that people who suffer from this disease have many risk factors for falls that have
      been identified in older individuals. Risk of falls is multi-factorial and impaired balance
      has been shown to contribute.

      The investigators aimed to demonstrate that, IMT performed during a PRP may improve Postural
      control in COPD patients.

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is a preventable and treatable disease. According
      to the WHO, COPD would be the third leading cause of death by 2030. This disease is
      characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is
      usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to
      noxious particles or gases. However, emerging data showed that COPD patients demonstrate
      important deficits in balance and control which associated to a high risk of fall.

      Individuals with COPD, especially those with inspiratory muscle weakness, increased their
      reliance on ankle muscle proprioceptive signals and decreased their reliance on back muscle
      proprioceptive signals during balance control, resulting in a decreased postural stability
      compared to healthy controls. These proprioceptive changes may be due to an impaired postural
      contribution of the inspiratory muscles to trunk stability.

      Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been shown to be an effective modality for COPD
      patients for improving the maximal inspiratory muscle strength, the dyspnea and
      health-related quality of life. However, the effect of inspiratory muscle training on
      postural control is not studying. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the
      inspiratory muscles training on posture in COPD patients.
