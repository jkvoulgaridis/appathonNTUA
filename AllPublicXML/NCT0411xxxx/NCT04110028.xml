      Patients will receive oral nicotinamide riboside or placebo and clinical and paraclinical

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients experiencing acute illness will often have a prolonged recovery time. The cause of
      this is unknown, but certain factors, like age, duration, and graveness of the illness, is
      associated with prolonged recovery. In this study, we will investigate whether nicotinamide
      riboside can shorten the recovery phase and improve outcome after acute illness.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to placebo or nicotinamide riboside (NR) in increasing doses. The safety of each dose will be evaluated before commencing the next phase. In each phase nicotinamide or placebo will be administered.
The patients will use NR for 90 days. When all patients have completed their NR treatment the study will be unblinded and the follow-up visits at one year later and further on will be unblinded.</intervention_model_description>
