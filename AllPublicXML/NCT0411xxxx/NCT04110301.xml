  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1b/2 trial studies the safety and best dose of lenalidomide when given together
      with MIL62 and how well this combination works in treating patients with Relapsed/Refractory
      low-grade Follicular Lymphoma(FL) and Marginal Zone Lymphoma(MZL). Giving MIL62 plus
      lenalidomide may work better in indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma(NHL).

      The Aim of this phase 1b/2 trial (MIL62 Plus Lenalidomide) is to find the safety and best
      dose of lenalidomide when given together with MIL62 and how well this combination works in
      treating patients with Relapsed/Refractory low-grade Follicular Lymphoma(FL) and Marginal
      Zone Lymphoma(MZL). Giving MIL62 plus lenalidomide may work better in indolent Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma(NHL).
