      INDICATION: Oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: Open
      label, double arm, randomized 1:1, multicenter phase III study.

    <description>This self-reported questionnaire that assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials consists of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).
The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each dimension has 3 levels (1 = &quot;no problems&quot;, 2 = &quot;some problems&quot;, and 3 = &quot;extreme problems&quot;). This questionnaire provide a 5-digit score which generate a health state profile. The VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the score range from 0 (Best imaginable health state) to 100 (Worst imaginable health state). The VAS is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <description>This self-reported questionnaire, designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment, contains 26 item divided in 5 domains (Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal). Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Definition of standard of care (prior to randomization):
Radiotherapy to the prostate in de novo metastatic patients Long-term Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) with or without intermittent treatment. Additional therapy with abiraterone acetate or docetaxel following tumor board meeting.
With the following radiotherapy modalities:
SBRT is delivered using the following regimen: 30 Grays (10 Gy x 3 fractions) for axial and appendicular bones and lymph node metastases if present. In case the dose cannot be safely delivered while maintaining a safe dose to the organs at risk, an alternate regimen (35 Gy in 5 fractions of 7 Gy) can be used.
In de novo metastatic patients: Prostate and seminal vesicle external beam radiotherapy using either 74-80 Gy with conventional fractionation (in fractions of 2 Gy) or using a hypofractionated regimen delivering 60 Gy (20 fractions of 3 Gy).</description>
