      This is a cohort study to study the analgesic effect of auricular pressure pill on persistent
      pain after hemorrhoidectiomy. Baseline pain intensity scores (VAS&gt;3) of the subjects will be
      collected 3 hours after the operation of the patients. By doctors' recommend interventions
      and the patients' preference, eligible subjects were naturally divided into the following
      queues: intravenous patient-controlled analgesia(IV-PCA),intravenous
      dezocine(IV-dezocine),intravenous patient-controlled analgesia+auricular
      acupressure(IV-PCA+AA),intravenous dezocine+auricular acupressure(IV-dezocine+AA). The
      treatment will last 5-7 days. Participants will receive auricular pressure once two days, and
      receive VAS, concomitant medication, PONV intensity scale and peripheral edema were recorded
      daily, and after the operation 3 hours, 3 days and 7 days the patients will receive anxiety
      and depression scale(HAD) , and VAS data will be collected by telephone at 3 and 6 months
      after the operation.

      The main indicators will be analyzed by VAS score and generalized linear model, with VAS
      results as the dependent variable, grouping as the random factor, surgical method, mixed
      hemorrhoid classification as fixed effects factor, and age, course of disease, baseline VAS
      scores and VAS follow-up time point as the covariables to analysis VAS score improved
      relations between various factors. Analgesic usage, ease pain evaluation method and using the
      same scale and HAD GLM model analysis.The secondary indicator analgesic usage rate will be
      analyzed using logistic regression analysis. fixed effects and covariate factors set with the
      GLM model.

      The purpose of this study was to seek high quality evidence-based medical evidence for
      intervention of auricular pressure pills on postoperative pain of hemorrhoidectomy.

    <description>It is a unidimensional measure providing a simple solution for measuring subjective experience. The VAS scale is a 10-cm line with 0 cm indicating no symptoms and 10 cm indicates the greatest extent of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale(HAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours, day 3, and day 7 after natural allocation</time_frame>
    <description>The HAD scale included measures of anxiety and depression, with scores ranging from 0 to 21. 0-7 points means asymptomatic;A score of 8-10 means suspicious;A score of 11 to 21 means definitely symptomatic( anxiety or depression).</description>

Auricular points are pressed unilaterally, and the cowherb seeds will be replaced with new ones every 2 days, alternating from left to right.</description>
