  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crizotinib is a first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ITK-ALK). It is the standard
      first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement. Alectinib,
      ceritinib and brigatinib are second-generation ITK-ALK. They have been shown to be effective
      in the first line of treatment in randomized trials. Alectinib has shown superiority to
      crizotinib as the first line of treatment in three randomized therapeutic trials, positioning
      this ITK-ALK as the treatment of choice in first-line treatment. Despite the effectiveness of
      these new treatments, all patients will virtually experience a relapse. There is no data on
      second-generation TKI-ALK resistance mechanisms when given as first-line treatment and the
      best therapeutic strategy for progression is undefined.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Written Informed Consent:

               -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not
                  part of normal subject care.

               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
                  schedule, and laboratory testing

          2. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced not eligible
             to a local treatment or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV accordingly to 8th
             classification TNM, UICC 2015) that carries an ALK rearrangement, as determined by the
             molecular biology platform of the investigator by FISH assay or by
             Immunohistochemistry (IHC), or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or RNA sequencing
             approach .

          3. Disease Status Requirements: Disease progression meeting RECISTv1.1 after first-line
             alectinib or brigatinib only. No prior chemotherapy is allowed in the metastatic
             disease setting.

          4. Tumor Requirements: All Patients must have at least one measurable target lesion
             according to RECIST v1.1. In addition, patients with asymptomatic and neurologically
             stable CNS metastases (including patients controlled with stable or decreasing steroid
             use within the last week prior to study entry) will be eligible. The brain metastases
             may be newly diagnosed after disease progression with alectinib or brigatinib or be
             present as progressive disease after surgery, whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery (see Exclusion Criterion for the lapsed time period required between the
             end of radiotherapy and study entry). Patients who have leptomeningeal disease (LM) or
             carcinomatous meningitis (CM) will be eligible if the LM/CM is visualized on MRI or if
             documented baseline cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) positive cytology is available and
             asymptomatic and neurologically stable (including patients controlled with stable or
             decreasing steroid use within the last week prior to study entry).

          5. Tumor Sample Requirement: Tumour biopsy sampling on fresh tissue (FFPE blocks
             required) at time of progression on first-line TKI is mandatory. Tumour biopsy should
             be exploitable for molecular analysis. If the tumour biopsy is not exploitable, the
             inclusion will be allowed if two blood samples are provided for tumoral cfDNA
             analysis. The Sponsor will monitor a posteriori the exploitability of provided tumour
             biopsies and will investigate the impossibility to perform or repeat tissue tumor
             sampling.

          6. Age ≥18 years.

          7. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, in the opinion of the Investigator.

         12. Adequate Liver Function, including:

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN;

               -  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN;
                  ≤5.0 x ULN if there is liver metastases involvement.

         13. Participants must have recovered from treatment toxicities to CTCAE Grade ≤ 1 (for
             participants who have developed interstitial lung disease [ILD], they must have fully
             recovered) except for AEs that in the investigator' judgment do not constitute a
             safety risk for the patient.

         14. Participants must have recovered from effects of any major surgery, or significant
             traumatic injury, at least 35 days before the first dose of lorlatinib

         15. For all females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be obtained
             within the screening period. A patient is of childbearing potential if, in the opinion
             of the investigator, she is biologically capable of having children and is sexually
             active. Additionally, all females of childbearing potential must provide an agreement
             to remain abstinent or use two adequate methods of contraception, including at least
             one method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period and for
             at least 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

         16. For men: agreement to remain abstinent or use a barrier method of contraception (e.g.,
             condom) during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug and agreement to refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

         17. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

             laboratory tests and other procedure.

         19. Participant has national health insurance coverage.

         20. Washout period: if previous progression on ALK-TKI: 7 days from last dose of the drug.

          1. Patients who experienced a clinical benefit of less than 6 months with front-line
             alectinib or brigatinib.

          2. Participants with disease progression on front-line treatment with 2G ALK-TKI i.e.

          3. Transdifferentiation into small cell lung cancer.

          4. Spinal cord compression is excluded unless the patient demonstrates good pain control

             function for the 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          5. Patients with symptomatic and neurologically instable CNS metastases or leptomeningeal
             metastasis (including patients that require increasing doses of steroids within one

             symptoms).

          6. Major surgery within 35 days of study entry. Minor surgical procedures (eg, port
             insertion, mediastinoscopy, surgical procedure for re-sampling) are not excluded, but
             sufficient time at investigator discretion should have passed for wound healing.

          7. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks of study entry (except palliative to relieve bone
             pain). Palliative radiation (≤15 fractions) must have been completed at least 48 hours

         13. History of bilateral or Grade 3 or 4 interstitial fibrosis or diffuse interstitial
             lung disease. Patients with history of prior radiation pneumonitis are not excluded.

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         15. Evidence of active malignancy (other than current NSCLC, non-melanoma skin cancer, in
             situ cervical cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, DCIS of the breast or localized and
