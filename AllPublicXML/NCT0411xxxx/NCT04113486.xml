  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe the difference between NMAP (nicotinamide metabolism associated
      protein) serum levels in primary diagnosed renal cancer patients and non-renal cancer patient
      controls, plot the ROC curve and establish appropriate cut-off values.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The tumor group patients were found to have renal or hepatic mass, plan to receive
             surgical treatment (except for radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, etc., which were
             not available for pathological examination). The control group patients were ruled out
             of tumor based on radiological tests and commonly used tumor biomarkers

          2. Age â‰¥ 18 years old and able to provide written informed consent;

          3. Have not received any systemic or topical treatment for kidney/liver tumors.

          4. Cardiopulmonary, liver and kidney functions are able to tolerate surgery and can
             comply with research requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The investigators believe that the subject may be unsuitable for inclusion due to
             severe concurrent diseases, infections, and etc.

          2. The subjects is known or suspected of other malignancies.

          3. There has been another history of malignancy in the past 5 years.

          4. Major surgery (surgery requiring general anesthesia) was performed within 4 weeks
             prior to screening visits.
