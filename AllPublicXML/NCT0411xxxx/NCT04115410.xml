      The objective of our study is to assess the risk of immune-related adverse events associated
      with PD-1 inhibitors use compared to standard chemotherapy use in patients with non small
      cell lung cancer, using nationwide healthcare database.

      This observational, retrospective cohort study will evaluate the risk of immune-related
      adverse events associated with PD-1 inhibitors use compared to standard chemotherapy use in
      patients with non small cell lung cancer, using nationwide healthcare database. PD-1
      inhibitors will be defined as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. Standard
      chemotherapy will be defined as cytotoxic chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      (epidermal growth cell receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors). The
      investigators will assess exposure on the cohort entry using the intention-to-treat approach
      with the 6-month exposure risk window from the first PD-1 inhibitor prescription to avoid
      bias from informative censoring. Immune-related adverse events will be defined by using
      pre-specified algorithms using diagnosis and corticosteroid prescription records (high dose
      of oral corticosteroids, defined as ≥ 30 mg/day, or systemic corticosteroid injection) to
      reduce outcome misclassification. The investigators will use a multivariable Cox proportional
      hazard model to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The model will
      be adjusted for pre-existing autoimmunity, history of lung cancer surgery, radiation therapy,
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor use, and previous systemic corticosteroid use. All analyses will be
      undertaken using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

    <description>PD-1 inhibitors are a group of checkpoint inhibitors being developed for the treatment of cancer. PD-1 and PD-L1 are both proteins present on the surface of cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as these are emerging as a front-line treatment for several types of cancer. The investigators will include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab as PD-1 inhibitors as these drugs are reimbursed by health authority of South Korea.</description>

        chemotherapy who subsequently switched to PD-1 inhibitors, from 21 August 2017 to 31
        September 2018, with follow-up until 31 December 2018. Patients who remained on standard
        chemotherapy treatment will be selected as comparators.
