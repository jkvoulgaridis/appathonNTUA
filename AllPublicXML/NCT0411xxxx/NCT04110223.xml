  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the common application of radiotherapy in cancer treatment, the prediction of
      radiosensitivity and treatment response has not yet entered the era of precision medicine.
      Therefore, development of genome-based methods for predicting radiosensitivity and treatment
      response is a central goal of radiation oncology. In the previous study, the investigators
      have identified a set of novel potential biomarkers associated with radiosensitivity and
      recurrence，through correlating patients' genomic profiles with toxicity, disease progression
      and overall survival after RT.

    <textblock>
      Researchers have long recognized that individual differences in sensitivity to radiation are
      caused by genetic variations and implicated multiple key pathways that might explain
      radiation toxicity. Normal tissue toxicity is a complex trait that involves the combined
      effect of a multitude of genes and pathways, and also dynamic interactions with the evolving
      cancer genome. The effect size of any individual factor is likely small. As a consequence,
      candidate gene approach and genome-wide association studies rarely lead to the identification
      of genetic determinants of radiation toxicity. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), on
      the other hand, has become increasingly routine in the clinic and would allow simultaneous
      assessment of multiple genetic alterations.
