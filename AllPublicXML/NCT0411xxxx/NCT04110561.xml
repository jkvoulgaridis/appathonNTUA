  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, open, bicentric and observational study. It is conducted to
      assess the safety and performance of the Atalante exoskeleton system with patients with lower
      limb paralysis.

      The principal objective is to assess the performance of the Atalante system in performing
      ambulatory functions with motor complete SCI patients characterized by the success rate in
      performing a 10mWT at the last session of training with the Atalante system.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint of the clinical investigation is defined by the success or failure at the 10 Meter Walk Test (10mWT) at the latest session.</measure>
    <time_frame>At study completion, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10mWT is used to assess walking speed in meters/second (m/s) over a short distance.
A clear pathway of at least 10-meter length is drawn. The start and the end point of a 10-m walkway is marked by lines.
The patient starts a few steps prior the starting line; during the few steps needed to reach the starting line, the physiotherapist should stabilize the exoskeleton in the frontal plane. When the patient's first foot crosses the starting line, the test begins, and the stopwatch is started. The stopwatch is stopped at the end of the 10 meters in case of success, that is to say when the patient crosses the end line.
The total time taken to ambulate is recorded. The distance covered is then divided by the total time (in seconds) taken to ambulate and recorded in meters per seconds.
In case of failure, the distance walked by the patient is measured and recorded, and the speed to walk this distance is calculated as described above.</description>

    <measure>Average scores on Borg CR-10 simple perception scale for the perceived exertion at the 6th and 12th sessions.</measure>
    <time_frame>At study mid-term, 10 days in average and at study completion, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a widely used and reliable indicator to monitor and guide exercise intensity.
The scale allows individuals to subjectively rate their level of exertion during exercise or exercise testing.
Developed by Gunnar Borg, it is often also referred to as the Borg Scale. Despite being a subjective measure of exercise intensity, RPE scales provide valuable information when used correctly.
The revised category-ratio scale (0 to 10 scale) is used:
0 Null
1 Very easy
2 Somewhat easy
3 Moderate
4 Somewhat hard
5 Hard
6
7 Very hard
8
9
10 Very, very hard</description>

    <measure>Average scores of safety perceived by the patient on a 7-point Likert scale 7 levels at the 6th and 12th sessions.</measure>
    <time_frame>At study mid-term, 10 days in average and at study completion, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Likert scale is a psychometric scale commonly involved in research based on survey questionnaires. Here, the respondents specify their level of agreement or disagreement using a symmetric agree-disagree scale for a series of statements while responding to a particular Likert questionnaire item. The range of Likert scale captures the intensity of their feelings for a given item.
The Likert scale ratings are:
Strongly disagree
Disagree
Disagree somewhat
Neither agree nor disagree
Agree somewhat
Agree
Strongly agree
The perceived safety is evaluated with the 7-point Likert scale on the following statement:
&quot;I felt safe during the test&quot;</description>

    <description>The neurogenic bowel dysfunction score is a questionnaire including questions about background parameters, faecal incontinence, constipation, obstructed defecation, and impact on quality of life. The NBD score is constructed from items with acceptable reproducibility and validity that were significantly associated with impact on quality of life. The type of the stool depends on the time it spends in the colon.</description>

    <description>The management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is crucial in the management of paraplegic patients as it affects the morbidity of these patients. The voiding mode is described. The self-survey is the standard treatment when the subject has an overactive bladder. The mictionnel mode will be informed before the first session, and at the end of the last session with the exoskeleton using an ISCOS questionnaire (International Spinal Cord Society questionnaire).</description>

    <measure>Spasticity according to the Modified Ashworth scale at the 1st and 12th sessions.</measure>
    <time_frame>At study start, day 1 and at study completion, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale measures spasticity in patients with lesion of the Central Nervous System. The relationship between the raters' judgments was significant and the reliability was good. (PMID: 3809245)
The scoring is:
0: No increase in muscle tone
1: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension
1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
2: More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension
Muscles evaluated are adductor, hamstring, triceps sural and quadriceps.</description>

    <description>NPSI (Neuropathic Pain Sumptom Inventory) renders it suitable for the evaluation of the different dimensions of neuropathic pain syndromes. The reliability of the different descriptors appears to be sufficient.
It allows to quantify the various pain symptoms that can be grouped into five dimensions (burn, deep pain, paroxysmal pain, pain caused, paresthesia / dysesthesia)</description>
