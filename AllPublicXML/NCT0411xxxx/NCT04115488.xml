  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, parallel arm, double-blind study with a total duration of
      subjects' participation of 48 weeks. Approximately 260 participants with relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis will be randomized to receive 12 doses of either PB006 or EU-licensed
      Natalizumab.

      This is a Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized, parallel-group
      study to assess the equivalence in efficacy and similarity in safety of biosimilar PB006
      compared to Tysabri in patients with RRMS.

      All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1
      ratio, to receive a total of twelve intravenous (IV) infusion of either PB006 or Tysabri at a
      dose of 300 mg at each intravenous (IV) infusion administered with every single one
      intravenous (IV) infusion administereds every 4 weeks of either PB006 or Tysabri at a dose of
      300 mg starting at visit 1 (week 0) through visit 12 (week 44), for a total of 12 infusions.
      The End-of-Study Visit (visit 13, week 48) will be performed 4 weeks after the last infusion
