    <textblock>
      International multicenter open-label single-arm confidence-interval-estimation based Phase II
      clinical trial, aiming to estimate a plausible range of the proportion of patients
      experiencing efficacy failure in the population, to provide evidence for efficacy and safety
      of the induction regimen with rATG and infliximab and a go/no go rule for further clinical
      development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 75 patients will receive the proposed induction regimen, with expected 68
      completers accounting for drop-outs and non-compliances with the protocol. If up to 27 out of
      the 68 completers experience efficacy failure, a progression into a larger trial will be
      considered justifiable. If the number of patients experiencing efficacy failure is between 28
      and 34 out of 68, the merits of a larger non-inferiority design will be considered depending
      on the risk/benefit assessment. If more than 34 out of the 68 completers experience efficacy
      failure, a progression into a larger trial would be considered unjustifiable. 1st kidney
      transplant recipients (low risk: PRA/cPRA &lt; 20%, no DSA) will receive short rATG induction
      (2x1.5 mg/kg) given perioperatively and on first postoperative day. All patients will receive
      one shot Infliximab mAb at day 2. Since POD1, maintenance IS consists of Tac and tapered
      steroids therapy. All patients will be followed up for one year.

      At the POD 0 the first rATG dose (1.5mg/kg) will be given according to the local practice and
      Methyprednisolon 500mg will be given before reperfusion. At the POD 1 patients will receive
      methylprednisolon 500mg i.v. followed by second rATG dose (1.5mg/kg). Infliximab 5mg/kg b.w.
      will be given in slow infusion on POD2. Tacrolimus will be given the first dose before
      surgery at dose 0.1 mg/kg and next from POD1 at 0.2mg/kg/day and doses adjusted according to
      blood trough levels (10-15 ng/mL, POD1-POD13, 5-8ng/mL POD 14-90, 4-6ng/mL POD &gt;90. Prednison
      (or appropriate dose of methylprednisolone) will be initiated POD 2 at a dose of 20mg/day and
      slowly tapered down to 5 mg at the POD 7 (POD2: 20mg, POD3: 15mg, POD4-5: 10mg, POD6-7:
      7,5mg, &gt; POD7: 5mg).

    <time_frame>baseline (pre transplantation), Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, and Month12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 provides scores for each of the eight health domains and psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health</description>

    <description>The questionnaires capture relevant apsects of resource consumption:
In which ward(s) a patient was hospitalized
Additional services (diagnostics / procedures / operations)
Potential dialysis procedures (past and expected frequency in the future)
Potential outpatient visits and the services consumed
Employment status and potential depency on care-giving The completion requires a review of inpatient records. Part II and Part III also require a short interview with the patient about potential outpatient visits during the study period, their employment status, and potential depedency on care-giving.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has been widely used in population health surveys, clinical studies, economic evaluation and in routine outcome measurement in the delivery of operational healthcare.
The EQ-5D-5L is a Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument that can generally assess the quality of life of patients, regardless of their disease, over 6 questions. It also includes a vertical EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS, 0-100 points) and a descriptive EQ-5D-5L system, which considers the following 5 dimensions or subscales over 5 levels or possible answers.
dimensions: mobility, self-sufficiency, General Activities, Pain / Physical complaints, fear / dejectedness levels: Level 1: No problems/ No pain/ Not afraid; Level 2: Slight problems/ Slight pain/ A little anxious; Level 3: Moderate problems/ Moderate pain/ Moderate anxiety; Level 4: Major problems / Severe pain/ Very anxious; Level 5: Not able to/ Extreme pain/ Extremely anxious</description>
