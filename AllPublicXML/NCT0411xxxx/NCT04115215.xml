  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and mobility impairments are critical contributors to dementia and disability in
      older adults, and can be caused by neurodegenerative and neurovascular changes at the
      pre-frontal (PF) brain areas. In a previous technological project funded by ISCiii, the
      investigators adapted a non-invasive, point-of-care optical methods (fNRIS/fDCS technology)
      to study PF metabolism and blood flow activation during cognitive and motor tasks, in older
      adults with and without cognitive impairment. These methods are sensitive to change after
      physical exercise (PE) and after selectively and safely stimulating PF areas with electrical
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tCS). PE and tCS have shown benefits for cognition
      and mobility in the elderly, but their prolonged effect on PF hemodynamic activation has not
      been studied. Understanding the specific action of these interventions on the brain, and
      their clinical cognitive and motor impact, is key to fine-tune appropriate treatment
      strategies.

      The FRONT STAGE project aims to compare, through a 3 arms single-blind randomized clinical
      trial, the impact of a 10 weeks, 1 hour/week program of PE (arm 1) Vs PE+tCS (arm 2) and Vs a
      control group (arm 3, healthy aging sessions and control of cardiovascular risk factors). The
      PE program is already implemented in primary care, as part of another previous project of the
      investigators' research group. Outcomes will include the optical measurement of PF metabolism
      and blood flow and clinical measures of cognitive and physical function. Front STAGE project
      will recruit 93 older adults with cognitive impairment and slow gait, but without dementia or
      disability in the activities of daily living (N=31 per arm). They will receive a
      comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline, together with the optical, cognitive and
      physical measures, and will be follow-up at 3 and 6 months. Weekly physical activity through
      accelerometry will be controlled in analyses.

      FRONT STAGE project centered on aging and the prevention of dementia and disability, will
      provide, translationally, more evidence to support and enlarge the clinical application of
      these interventions, and will contribute to foster further research in this field.

    <measure>Changes in hemoglobin oxygenation during functional tasks, as measured using fNIRS+fDCS optical techniques.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to intervention), 3 and 6 months after completion of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome will be hemoglobin oxygenation during a) randomized executive function tests, such as phonetic verbal fluencies, Stroop and Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], b) normal gait, c) obstacle negotiation test and d) dual task (walking associated with verbal fluency).
All the measures will controlled for extra-cerebral and systemic contributions due to variations in heart-rate, arterial oxygen saturation, respiration rate and end-tidal carbondioxide. Various measures such as those derived from accelerometers to account for potential motion artifacts will be also utilized, followed by a multi-subject analysis.</description>

    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is a neuropsychological test extensively used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute, well-known as the Stroop Effect.
Scoring method adopted was (i) the number of correct answers in a fixed time in each SCWT condition (W, C, CW) and (ii) a global index relative to the CW performance minus reading and/or colours naming abilities.</description>

    <measure>Clinical comorbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes found in administrative data, such as hospital abstracts data. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use.</description>

    <description>EuroQol-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has been widely used in population health surveys, clinical studies, economic evaluation and in routine outcome measurement in the delivery of operational healthcare. This instrument is designed for self-completion and as such captures information directly from the respondent, thereby generating data that conforms with the general requirement of all Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures. Total score will be used, with higher scores revealing higher quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Yesavage GDS-15 items assesses depressive symptoms. The scale consists of 15 yes/no questions. Each question is scored as either 0 or 1 points.

    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Total score of the Jenkins questionnaire will be used to estimate quality of sleep. This questionnaire consists of 4 items rated on a 6-point scale. The 4 items ask how frequently during the previous 4 weeks the respondent experienced difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up several times per night, and waking up feeling tired and worn out after the usual amount of sleep. A dichotomous index is computed and coded as 1 if the respondents reported that any of the above sleep disturbances occurred 15 or more nights during the previous 4 weeks or as 0, if not. The selection of 15 nights as the cut-off point for sleep disturbance was based on criteria from the DSM-IV-TR, which stipulate that difficulty maintaining/initiating sleep or non-restorative sleep should be present for 3 or more nights per week for at least 1 month. A similar cut-off point for sleep disturbance was used in previous studies.</description>

    <description>This arm includes 10 sessions of multi-component exercise sessions (including aerobic, resistance, flexibility, dual-tasking) of 1 hour/week of functional group exercise, directed to foster empowerment for subsequent continuation of exercise in community-dwelling older adults referred by primary care to a geriatrician and an expert physical therapist. Between sessions, the validated material by the ViviFrail EU program (either leaflets or an ad-hoc mobile application) is used to promote self-training. According to the available data, adherence is high and the impact on physical function (SPPB scale and gait speed) at 3 month is clinically and statistically significant.</description>

    <description>This arm includes 1 application/week for 10 weeks during PE, through an adapted commercial helmet. Transcranial current stimulation (tCS) is a neural stimulation technique based on electrical stimulation of selected parts of the brain with direct or alternated electrical current (tDCS or tACS) of very low intensity of 2 milliamps (mA), using one or more electrodes placed on the skull. tCS is non-invasive (no surgical procedures) and it is painless, as applied in the proposed protocols. Immediate cognitive performance will be assessed through a verbal fluency test.</description>
