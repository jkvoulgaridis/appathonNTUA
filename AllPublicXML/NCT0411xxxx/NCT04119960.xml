  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women. Early
      pulmonary nodule screening is an effective means to prevent lung cancer, which is no less
      important than the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Early lung cancer screening has
      been investigated and applied as a medical practice. InferRead Lung CT.AI by Infervision is a
      dedicated post processing application that generates CADe marks as an overlay on the original
      CT series intended to aid the radiologist in the detection of pulmonary nodules. This study
      was designed to evaluate radiologists' performance in detecting actionable nodules on chest
      CT when aided by InferRead.

    <description>The primary objective of this clinical study is to demonstrate that a radiologist review of a CT scan aided with InferRead Lung CT.AI significantly improves detection of actionable lung nodules. Area under the ROC curve, Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV will be reported, compared between unaided and aided reads.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this clinical study is to demonstrate that the radiologist's review time is not significantly increased when aided with InferRead Lung CT.AI. The reading time for each case will be recorded in both aided and unaided reads. The reading times will be compared using a paired T test.</description>
