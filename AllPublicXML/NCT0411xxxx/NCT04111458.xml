  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 1701963 as monotherapy and in combination with
      trametinib in patients with KRAS mutated solid tumours.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BI 1701963 as monotherapy
      and in combination with trametinib, to characterise pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
      and to evaluate first efficacy signals.
