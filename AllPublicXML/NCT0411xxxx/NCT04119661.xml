      The aim of this prospective, randomized, clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of the
      side-vented Max-i-Probe versus the end-vented NaviTip as endodontic needles during syringe
      irrigation on post-operative pain in adult patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in
      posterior mandibular teeth.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of the
      side-vented Max-i-Probe versus the end-vented NaviTip as endodontic needles during syringe
      irrigation on post-operative pain in adult patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in
      posterior mandibular teeth. Medical and dental history was obtained from all participants in
      this trial and clinical examination for teeth was performed. Participants with symptomatic
      irreversible pulpitis were included. After access cavity preparation, participants were
      randomly assigned to one of the following groups: experimental group (Max-i-Probe) or control
      group (NaviTip). One-visit root canal treatment was performed . Each patient received a 48-h
      diary to record postoperative pain. Post-operative pain was measured at the following time
      points: 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours after root canal treatment.
