  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that surgical site infiltration with
      liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is non-inferior to and more cost effective than thoracic epidural
      analgesia (TEA) for patients undergoing open gynecologic surgery on an established enhanced
      recovery program (ERP) using a non-inferiority randomized trial design. The impact of TEA and
      surgical site infiltration with LB on neuroendocrine and inflammatory mediators of surgical
      stress response (SSR) will also be investigated as a translational endpoint.

    <measure>Change in Patient-perceived quality of recovery as assessed by the Quality of Recovery-15 instrument (QoR-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7 post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Mean patient-perceived quality of recovery scores using the Quality of Recovery-15 instrument (QoR-15) on postoperative days 1 to 7 will be compared between the two arms. The QoR-15 is a validated instrument designed to measure the major domains of postoperative recovery including functional independence, physical comfort/pain, psychological/emotional well-being, cognition and satisfaction with a score of 0 indicating the poorest patient-perceived quality of recovery and 150 indicating the highest patient-perceived quality of recovery.</description>

    <measure>Mobility as assessed by the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 days post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility scale is an ordinal scale from 1 to 8, with numbers representing mobility milestones that patients accomplish, based on observation. Patients who score a 2 have some type of bed mobility, while those scoring an 8 can walk more than 250 feet.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 days post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pasero Opioid-induced Sedation Scale (POSS) is a valid, reliable tool used to assess sedation when administering opioid medications to manage pain. It uses an ordinal scale of 1-4 with a POSS of 1 or 2 indicating an acceptable level of sedation and a score of 3 or 4 indicating over-sedation and the need for intervention, such as the administration of a reversal agent in the case of a score of 4.</description>

    <description>Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) surgical site infiltration: A single 20 mL liposomal bupivacaine vial containing 266 mg of free-base bupivacaine will be mixed with 60 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl) and then diluted in preservative-free sterile 0.9% saline for maximal volume not to exceed 300 mL. Dilution with 0.9% saline will be dependent upon length of surgical incision per protocol. The solution will be injected using 22-gauge needle in equal distribution into the peritoneum, along the fascia and into the subcutaneous tissues of the surgical wound by trained faculty surgeons.</description>
