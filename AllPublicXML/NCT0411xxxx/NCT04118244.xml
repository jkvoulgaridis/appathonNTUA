  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic preload indices, such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation
      (SVV) are generally accepted as accurate indicator of fluid responsiveness in mechanically
      ventilated patients. Because SVV and PPV are generated by the pressure transmitted from the
      airways to the pleural and pericardial spaces, their reliability is limited in patients
      receiving low tidal volume (VT) ventilation and in those with a driving pressure lower than
      20 cm H2O.

      Lung-protective ventilation using low VT with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) has
      recently been demonstrated to significantly improve postoperative outcome, and its
      application is gradually increasing in surgical patients. However, protective ventilation
      alters the predictability of dynamic preload indices and thus limits their use in the
      operating theatre.

      Lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs), used to reopen collapsed lung, and PEEP have been proposed
      as the key components of lung-protective ventilation strategy. LRM increases intrathoracic
      pressure, which in turn causes a transient decrease in stroke volume (SV) and arterial
      pressure; this may depend on preload status. Interestingly, recent study reported that the
      augmented PPV during LRM using vital capacity maneuver (VCM, continuous positive airway
      pressure of 30 cm H2O for 10 s) could predict preload responsiveness under open chest
      condition.

      Investigators hypothesized that the augmented PPV and SVV by a stepwise LRM with incremental
      PEEP could represent a functional test to suggest preload responsiveness and, therefore,
      predict fluid responsiveness. The aims of the current study were (1) to assess the ability of
      augmented PPV and SVV during stepwise LRM-induced to predict fluid responsiveness in
      mechanically ventilated patients in the operating room, (2) to assess the ability of stepwise
      LRM-induced decrease in SV (ΔSV-LRM) to predict fluid responsiveness.

    <description>The ventilator was switched to pressure control ventilation, inspiratory time was increased to 50%, the peak inspiratory pressure gradient (above PEEP) was set at 15cm H2O, and PEEP was progressively increased to obtain a stepwise increase of peak inspiratory to 20, 25, and 30 cm H2O every three breaths. The final recruiting pressure of 30 cm H2O was applied for six breaths.</description>
