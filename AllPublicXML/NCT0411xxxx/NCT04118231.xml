  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dry needling, static stretching and
      instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization on joint range of motion, performance and muscle
      structure in individuals with Hamstring muscle shortness and to examine the changes in soft
      tissue before and after application with the help of ultrasound elastography.

      The study was randomly divided into 3 groups. Group 1: Hamstring muscle group of patients for
      5 minutes Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization made of stainless steel instruments
      used by soft tissue mobilization by the therapist. In order to reduce friction and increase
      lubricity before application; If there is an unexpected erythema, edema or other unexpected
      side effects, the application will be stopped immediately.

      2.Group: In the Hamstring muscle group of the patients, the acupuncture needles, which are
      made of stainless steel, sterile and disposable, will be applied under the supervision of an
      expert doctor for 30-45 seconds. In case of unexpected side effects, the application will be
      terminated.

      Group 3: Patients' Hamstring muscle group under the supervision of the physiotherapist for a
      total of 5 minutes; A total of 10 repetitions of static tension will be applied for 30
      seconds.

      Before starting the study, anthropometric measurements, vertical and horizontal jump amounts
      of all participants will be measured before the application. Digital inclinometer will be
      used to determine the range of motion of the joint. Measurements will be made before and
      after the first application and the last measurement will be made 3 days after the end of 12
      sessions. In addition, soft tissue changes in the hamstring muscle of the participants will
      be evaluated by US elastography before and at the end of the 12th session.
