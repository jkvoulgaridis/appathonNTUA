  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter, open-label, biology driven, phase II study using a sequential
      Bayesian design, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of different Matched Targeted
      Therapy (MTT) in independent and parallel cohorts of treatment.

      Patients will be assigned to a treatment cohort based on molecular
      alterations/characteristics detected on tumor sample from primary tumor or metastatic lesion.

      In this protocol, several MTTs treatment cohorts are planned. This study is designed with the
      flexibility to open new MTTs treatment cohorts and to close existing MTTs treatment cohorts
      that demonstrate no clinical benefit. Each treatment cohort will be driven separately even
      though procedures, quality control and reporting, will be common. The protocol will be
      amended in order to include new treatments or combinations that emerge as being of interest
      for patients with advanced/metastatic cancers.

      All eligible patients will receive study drugs as long as patient experiences clinical
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator, or until unacceptable toxicity, or until
      symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator
      after an integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status, or withdrawal of
      consent.

      Patients will be permitted to continue study treatment after progressive disease according to
      RECIST v1.1 if they meet all of the following criteria and following validation of the
      Sponsor:

        -  Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigators,

        -  Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values; e.g., new or
           worsening hypercalcemia) that indicate unequivocal progression of disease,

        -  No decline in ECOG Performance Status (PS) that can be attributed to disease
           progression.
