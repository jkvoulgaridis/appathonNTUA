    <textblock>
      Background The mechanisms behind non-specific neck pain (NS-NP) have not yet been fully
      clarified. The anatomic relation between the tongue and structures that attach to the
      cervical spine suggests a possible clinical relation with a NS-NP.

      This study protocol describes a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial, the aim of which is
      to determine the influence of the release of the tongue muscles on pain intensity, cervical
      range of motion and neck function in individuals with NS-NP.

      Methods/Design Forty patients with NS-NP will be enrolled in a randomized, double-blind,
      clinical trial. The participants will be randomly allocated to two groups of 20 patients
      each. The experimental group (EG) will be submitted to a clinical method considered the gold
      standard for the treatment of neck pain together with a tongue muscle release protocol. The
      control group (CG) will only receive the gold standard method for the treatment of neck pain.
      All patients will receive six sessions of treatment at a frequency of twice per week and will
      be evaluated before and one week after the end of treatment. The primary outcome will be pain
      intensity measured using a numerical pain rating scale (range: 0 [no pain] to 10 [maximum
      pain]). The secondary outcomes will be the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient-Specific
      Functional Scale, Neck Disability Index and cervical range of motion. Comparisons between
      groups before and after treatment will demonstrate whether the tongue muscle release
      technique exerts an effect on pain intensity, cervical range of motion and neck function in
      individuals with NS-NP.

      Discussion The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of a
      tongue muscle release technique on pain intensity, cervical range of motion and neck function
      in patients with NS-NP. The data will be published after the study is completed. The study
      will support the practice of evidence-based physical therapy for individuals with nonspecific
      neck pain.

    <time_frame>Before and one week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain is an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a self-administered scale that enables the identification of individuals with psychological traits for catastrophizing pain (coping behavior or set of negative thoughts related to a painful experience). The instrument consists of 13 items, divided into 3 subtypes: hopelessness, magnification and rumination, in which the patient will report the degree of thought or feeling described in relation to cervical pain from 0 (does not present the suggested feeling) to 5 (presents the all the time). The total score is given by the sum of all items, ranging from 0 to 52 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is a self-assessment scale on which the patient selects five important activities that are either hindered or impeded due to neck pain. The participant will attribute a score representing the degree of difficulty in executing each activity ranging from 0 (&quot;unable to perform activity&quot;) to 10 (&quot;able to perform activity as easily as before the injury or problem&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess neck pain and disability. The items are organized by type of activity and followed by six different statements expressing progressive levels of functional capability. Each item is scored from 0 to 5 points. The maximum score is 50 points.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cervical range of motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and one week after the end of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical range of motion (ROM) will be determined with the aid of a digital camera to capture the movements of flexion, extension, right rotation, left rotation, right lateral inclination and left lateral inclination. Each movement will be performed three times. The participant will be seated with the back supported on the backrest of the chair. The images will be processed using the free Kinovea software (version 0.8.26). Angle measurement will be calculated for each movement, with the highest values considered the ROM.</description>

    <description>The protocol to be used in the study is in accordance with the latest guidelines for the treatment of neck pain associated with limited mobility for patients in the chronic phase. The followed techniques will be performed: i) manual therapy - manipulation or mobilization of the upper cervical spine, manipulation or mobilization of the cervical, cervicothoracic and thoracic regions, manual cervical traction, release of the cervical muscles and muscles of the scapulothoracic region; ii) exercises - strengthening and resistance exercises for the muscles of the scapular girdle, coordination, proprioception and postural training of the cervical and scapulothoracic regions.</description>
