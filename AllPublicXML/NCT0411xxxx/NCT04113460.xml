  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic nonspecific neck pain (CNNP) is a public health issues with a 50% life prevalence.
      CNNP is a leading cause of disability which contributes to higher costs due to loss of
      productivity, disability, and increased absenteeism from work. Yoga has been found effective
      managing neck pain but there has been no study at work setting for chronic non-specific neck
      pain.

      To determine the effectiveness of Yoga@work program for chronic non specific neck pain among
      office workers, present randomised controlled trial was undertaken.
