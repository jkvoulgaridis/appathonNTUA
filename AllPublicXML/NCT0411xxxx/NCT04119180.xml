  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of moderate sedation in pediatric dentistry,
      compared to protective stabilization, which remains routinely used in the Brazilian context
      despite moral questions. The objective of this prospective nonrandomized clinical trial is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the use of moderate sedation, compared to the protective
      stabilization, in the dental care of children with fear / anxiety and / or dental behavior
      problem, and associated factors. The study will be carried out in outpatient clinics of the
      Dental Schools of the Federal University of Goiás (UFG) and University of São Paulo (USP),
      with the support of professors from King's College London through the partnership CEDACORE -
      Children Experiencing Dental Anxiety: Collaboration on Research and Education. Participants
      will be 152 children under 7 years of age with dental caries, who need specialized dental
      treatment due to a history of non-cooperation with dental care. The interventions to be
      compared are moderate sedation with oral administration of ketamine and midazolam (UFG) and
      protective stabilization (USP). The primary endpoint 'behavior / anxiety of the child during
      treatment will be assessed using the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale. The
      secondary outcomes are: dental behavioral and anxiety evolution of the child, child' pain
      during procedure, impact on the quality of life related to oral health, parents and dentists'
      satisfaction and stress, adverse events for sedated participants, longevity of composite and
      glass ionomer cement restorations, chronotype and physiological stress of these children. A
      cost-efficacy analysis will be produced at the end of the study from the perspective of the
      Sistema Único de Saúde. Additionally, at the end of 36 months, the investigators expect to
      contribute to the identification of psychosocial aspects related to dental behavior problems
      in children in early childhood. It is important to highlight the perspective of technological
      innovation, with the creation of a digital platform that will allow the registration of data
      related to the dental care of children worldwide and favor analyzes in the methodology of
      data science.

    <description>Children's behavior assessed by OSUBRS (Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale) in digital videos recorded during the administration. Scores: 1 - quiet, 2 - cry with movement, 3 - movement without cry; 4 - struggling. The higher the percentage of time of care in which the child behaves quietly, the better their behavior. Measurements for each group will be synthesized as mean (or median) and standard deviation (or interquartile range).</description>

    <description>A 10-centimeter Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is used by one of the trained/calibrated dentists to measure the child behavior during the dental session (Hosey and Blinkhorn, 2005). The VAS anchors are &quot;negative behavior&quot; (left) and &quot;positive behavior&quot; (right). At the end of the session, raters mark a point on the 10 cm line to correspond to the perceived level of behavior; this is then measured using a ruler to give a score to the nearest millimeter which can vary from 0 to 100). The higher the VAS score, the better the child's behavior assessed by the dentist</description>

    <description>The B-ECOHIS is a measure of oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) validated in Brazil by Scarpelli et al. (2008) to assess the impact of oral health problems and related treatment on the quality of life of children aged zero to five years and their families. &quot;The ECOHIS consists of 13 questions divided into two main parts: child impact section (part one) and family impact section (part two). The child impact section comprises of four subscales: child symptom, child function, child psychology and child self-image/social interaction. The family impact section contains two subscales: parental distress and family function. The questionnaire is scored using a simple five-point Likert scale with responses ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often&quot; (equivalent to a score of 0 and 4, respectively). A total score ranging from zero to 52 is calculated as a simple sum of the responses with higher scores denoting a greater oral health impact and/or poorer OHRQoL.&quot; (Martins-Junior et a. 2012).</description>
