      This study is an open-label, single-center, randomized, comparative phase IV clinical trial.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety andimmunogenicity of concomitant
      administration of EV71 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac (Beijing) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd.
      with measles mumps, and rubella combined live attenuated vaccine/ encephalitis live
      attenuated vaccine. 360 healthy infants of 8 months old as participants are randomly assigned
      into three experimental groups in the ratio 1:1:1. The group I receive EV71 Vaccine (first
      dose)&amp;measles mumps, and rubella combined live attenuated vaccine on day 0 and EV71 vaccine
      (second dose)&amp;encephalitis live attenuated vaccine on day 30. The group II receive measles
      mumps, and rubella combined live attenuated vaccine on day 0 and encephalitis live attenuated
      vaccine on day 30. The group III receive the first and second dose of EV71 Vaccine on day 0
      and day 30 respectively.
