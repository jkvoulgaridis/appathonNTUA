  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of society, the number of emergency critical operations is increasing
      year by year. Traditionally, the patient's systemic and circulatory status is indirectly
      assessed by testing and blood pressure heart rate. There are cases where the diagnosis is
      imperfect and the results are unreliable. Preoperative POU rapid ultrasound is a preoperative
      bedside ultrasound evaluation method first proposed by the Anesthesiology Department of Huaxi
      Hospital (three engineering units). This project will cooperate with Huaxi Hospital to
      explore whether the effect of intraoperative anesthesia management under POU guidance is
      better than traditional anesthesia management. This study will provide a new preoperative
      evaluation anesthesia management program for emergency critically ill patients with important
      clinical and social significance.

      According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients will be randomly divided into
      two groups：In the control group, the anesthesiologist performed according to the existing
      preoperative evaluation program and existing experience, and guided the anesthesia management
      with the evaluation results.The experimental group used POU protocol ultrasound to perform a
      heart scan and a standard scan, a large vascular scan under the xiphoid, a body cavity scan,
      a standard section, and a lung scan in 10 minutes. Comprehensive preoperative circulation and
      assessment of systemic conditions, and guided intraoperative anesthesia management with
      assessment results.
