  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Contagious Misinformation Trial the investigators aim to debunk prevalent
      misinformation about an infectious disease using two evidence-based methods of debunking. The
      two debunking methods are packaged in two audio dramas of 4 episodes each, which will be sent
      to the WhatsApp of participants who are randomised to intervention group 1 or 2. The control
      group will receive audio messages about a different topic. The primary outcome is the
      reduction in belief in two misinformation statements about the infectious diseases.

    <masking_description>Participant will not know the group they are assigned to, as all groups (also the control group) will receive audio messages.

  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the belief in misinformation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the belief in misinformation will be measured through Yes/No questions in the baseline and follow-up surveys. Using logistic regression models, the prevalence of the belief in misinformation about 2 aspects of an infectious disease compared to the control group will be analysed using an intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inadvertent promotion of misinformation: the backfire effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>To test whether the interventions might inadvertently have promoted the belief in misinformation, the same yes/no questions as the primary outcome will be used in ordinal logistic regression models to analyse if the there has been a backfire effect in the intervention groups, compared to the control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>As treated analysis of primary outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Yes/No questions of the primary outcomes will be tested in an as-treated analysis. The investigators will only include participants who can correctly recall the basic storylines of the audio messages.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge about preventive methods</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using an open question, asking the respondent to name up to 3 preventive methods, a score will be created. For every correct answer, the participants gets a point, and one point is subtracted for every wrong answer; leading to a potential score of -3 to +3. Ordinal logistic regression models will be fitted to compare the scores of the intervention groups with the control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related discussions among family/friend</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The question asking whether the participant has discussed the content of the audio messages will be used for this analysis, together with the question about how often the participant discussed health issues with family/friends. Logistic regression models will be fitted to test whether the interventions have influenced health-related discussions with family or friends, as compared to the control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Method of administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>To understand if the intervention works outside of WhatsApp, 60 additional people will be recruited who do not have WhatsApp. Participants will instead be called and listen to the audio dramas on the phone; 30 will listen to the audio drama of intervention group 1 and 30 will listen to the audio drama of intervention group 2. The two primary outcomes will be analysed similar to the primary outcome analysis (ITT and per protocol) among the 2 groups and compared to the control group, as well as to their equivalent group of respondents with WhatsApp.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will answer 3 questions about their perceived self-efficacy on 3 specific preventive behaviours. Answers are on a 5-item scale: from not at all true to exactly true. Ordinal logistic regression models will be specified to test whether the interventions had an influence on people's self-efficacy about three specific preventive behaviours, compared to the control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk perception &amp; preventive methods</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Risk perception about the infectious disease will be measured with a question that asks how likely it is that the participants gets the disease in the next year. A question which asks what kind of actions the participants has undertaken, or is planning to undertake, to prevent infection with the disease - will be used to assess if and what kind of actions are taken. Several analyses will be carried out to test whether the intervention influenced risk perception and preventive methods. Furthermore, analyses will be carried out to determine if the a change in risk perception influenced preventive methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective versus subjective learning</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the follow-up survey, there is a question asking if the participant feels like he/she learned from the audio messages (yes/no question). A Chi-Square analysis will be done to determine whether those who feel like they learned also learned objectively, using the two primary outcomes.</description>

    <description>The audio dramas (one drama of 4 episodes per intervention group), aim to debunk misinformation about an infectious disease. The content of the two dramas differ in the two groups; in intervention group 1, the drama will state the misinformation and provide a plausible alternative, delivered through a trusted source, in line with world views. In intervention group 2, the audio drama will avoid mentioning the misinformation and instead only state the correct information about the infectious disease</description>
