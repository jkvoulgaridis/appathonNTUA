        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 5 and 75 years old, inclusive.

          -  Either a healthy volunteer or a diagnosis of a neurologically-based walking disorder
             due to stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, or cerebral palsy.

          -  Must be able to understand and follow simple directions based on parent report and
             clinical observation during the history and physical examination.

          -  Able to provide verbal assent, if appropriate. If the participant is non-verbal,
             parental interpretation of gesticulation for assent will be used.

          -  The ability to read and understand English.

          -  Able to walk at least 30 feet with or without a walking aid (GMFCS Level I-III for
             individuals with cerebral palsy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ Any neurological, musculoskeletal or cardiorespiratory injury, health condition (
        including pregnancy), or diagnosis other than stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's
        disease or cerebral palsy that would affect the ability to walk as directed for short
        periods of time.
