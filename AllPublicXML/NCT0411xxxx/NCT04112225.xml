    <textblock>
      This study will use a longitudinal randomized experimental design. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a positive affect skills intervention or a psychoeducation
      control group and assessed with questionnaires at baseline and immediately post 8-week
      intervention.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either a positive affect skills intervention or a
      psychoeducation control group, with each intervention lasting 8-weeks. Participants in the
      positive affect skills intervention will have full access to the unchanged Happify platform.

      The psychoeducation control group participants will use a version of the Happify platform
      that encourages thinking about well-being through quizzes and polls without providing any
      instructions for promotion (i.e., Wait-list Control). Participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires before and after the 8-week program, at which point study participation will
      end.

    <description>Composite score made of perceived stress, positive emotionality, and optimism. Perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983), a 10-item questionnaire that asks users to rate on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (very often) how frequently they experience various symptoms of feeling stress. Positive emotionality was measured using the emotion subscale of the Happify Scale (HS-E; Carpenter, Crutchley, Zilca, Schwartz, Smith, Cobb, &amp; Parks, 2016), which is a 4-item scale asking participants to rate the extent to which, over the past week, they have experienced positive and negative emotions that are activated or de-activated. Optimism was measured using the Life Orientation Scale, Revised (LOT-R; Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985), a 6-item scale on which participants rate the extent to which they identify with optimistic or pessimistic beliefs.</description>
