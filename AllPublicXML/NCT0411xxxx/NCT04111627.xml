    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of duloxetine to aerobic exercise in the treatment of
      symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and depressive symptoms in adults. All participants will
      receive the receive the treatment protocol, which will first be evaluated in terms of
      feasibility and then pilot tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects 10% of men and 13% of women 60 years or older,
      and depressive symptoms are common, occurring in one-fifth of these patients. Depressive
      symptoms worsen knee OA disease severity and are a barrier to pain management and engagement
      in physical activity. Guidelines recommend depression treatment in older adults with knee OA
      but provide no direction on how to simultaneously manage the co-occurrence of physical and
      mental morbidity. Treatment recommendations advise exercise to manage pain and disability and
      improve psychosocial health in knee OA patients; however, compliance to exercise programs is
      low in persons with chronic pain and disability and is only made worse by comorbid
      depression. Adherence is critical to the efficacy of depression treatments using exercise
      training, and no such exercise program has ever been designed for and tested in OA patients
      with co-occurring depressive symptoms in a way to enhance compliance. Duloxetine is the only
      antidepressant medication indicated for pain management in knee OA patients that has
      demonstrated efficacy and tolerability when treating depression in older adults and is a
      viable pharmacological complement to exercise. There are no protocols that combine treatments
      using interventions that affect symptoms of both knee OA and depression, and the study goals
      are to evaluate the feasibility of and then pilot test a protocol comprised of aerobic
      exercise training plus duloxetine for the treatment of symptomatic knee OA and comorbid
      depression.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scale (KOOS) pain subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain Severity at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported KOOS pain subscale is sensitive to changes in knee OA symptoms, and consists of nine items scored on a Likert scale (0 [No problems] to 4 [Extreme Problems]) that ranges from 0-36, with higher values indicating greater severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Depression Severity at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is clinician-administered, 21-item questionnaire, designed to rate the severity of depression in patients. Individual scores are based on the first 17 items, each with a possible score of 0-4 (0=Absent; 4=Extreme Symptoms) or 0-2 (0=Absent; 2=Frequent), yielding an overall range of 0-54. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal oxygen consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Peak Maximal Oxygen Consumption at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peak maximal oxygen consumption will be assessed while patients are walking on a treadmill, when they are respiring through a non-rebreather mask to collect expired air. Carbon dioxide and oxygen gas concentrations will be measured, and the final 20 seconds of oxygen consumption are averaged to determine peak consumption.</description>

    <description>Participants will have a starting duloxetine dosage of 30 mg/day and be titrated up to a daily optimal dosage of 60 mg/day as tolerated during the first 12-weeks of the study. Twelve weeks after the receipt of their prescription, participants will be evaluated for the need to increase medication dosage to 90 mg/day. After duloxetine initiation, participants will be provided an exercise prescription that includes a progressive walking program aiming to achieve 50 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, three times per week, over 24 weeks.</description>

    <description>Duloxetine is an FDA-approved selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis as well as depression in adults. Participants with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and depressive symptoms will receive duloxetine to decrease pain and depression severity to enhance their ability to engage in aerobic exercise.</description>
