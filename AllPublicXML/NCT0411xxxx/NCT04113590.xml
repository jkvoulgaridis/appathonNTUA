  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently the standard procedure for removing the
      gallbladder. This procedure usually requires the insertion of four trocars into the abdomen
      for passage of laparoscopic instruments; each trocar requires a small incision, which results
      in postoperative pain and scarring. There has recently been a tremendous surge in interest
      within the surgical community to further reduce the pain, invasiveness, and cosmesis of
      laparoscopic surgery. To achieve this goal, surgeons are either reducing the number of
      trocars placed through the abdominal wall or eliminating them completely The goal of this
      project is to evaluate the feasibility of performing transvaginal cholecystectomy while
      obtaining safe access under laparoscopic visualization. This has the potential to decrease
      postoperative pain, improve cosmesis, and lead to a shorter recovery following
      cholecystectomy.

      20 female patients will be enrolled. Patients who are scheduled to undergo elective
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be invited to participate in this study. The laparoscopic
      instrumentation will be sterilized using standard methods. Conventional and new laparoscopic
      and endoscopic equipment will be used for this project; all equipment is commercially
      available and is FDA-approved for laparoscopic procedures. Access will be obtained into the
      peritoneal cavity at the umbilicus in a standard fashion, either by use of a Veress needle
      technique or by insertion of a trocar using the open technique. Through a single umbilical
      incision, a 5mm trocar will be placed into the peritoneal cavity. A 5mm laparoscope will then
      be inserted into the peritoneal cavity. This will be used to monitor safe peritoneal entry of
      a dilating12mm transvaginal trocar. Subsequent operative visualization will be by use of a
      flexible endoscope which will be placed through the transvaginal port. The gallbladder will
      be retracted using sutures as well as endoscopic and / or laparoscopic graspers. In order to
      obtain the critical view of safety [5] the cystic duct and artery will be dissected, ligated
      and divided by use of conventional laparoscopic and new articulating instruments. The
      dissected gallbladder will be retrieved transvaginally. If for any reason suitable retraction
      or dissection cannot be performed using the transvaginal strategy, the case will be promptly
      converted to a standard laparoscopic approach by the insertion of additional transabdominal
      trocars.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility of performing a transvaginal cholecystectomy while obtaining safe access under laparoscopic visualization. A postoperative Quality of Life questionnaire will be given to the patient to access pain. We will also address whether cosmesis was a factor for their decision. Operative time will be tracked as well as standard operative outcomes including any complications. Patients will be kept for 23 hours observation postoperatively and will follow up in the clinic.</description>

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility of performing a transvaginal cholecystectomy while obtaining safe access under laparoscopic visualization. A Visual Analog Scale for pain will be given to the patient to access pain. We will also address whether cosmesis was a factor for their decision. Operative time will be tracked as well as standard operative outcomes including any complications. Patients will be kept for 23 hours observation postoperatively and will follow up in the clinic.The Visual Analog Scale is a scale from 0-10, with 10 being a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The removal of the gallbladder through several small incisions using a camera to see is called laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study is being done to evaluate whether cholecystectomy can be performed through a natural orifice (the vagina) with minimal laparoscopic assistance (only one abdominal trocar versus four in the routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy).</description>
