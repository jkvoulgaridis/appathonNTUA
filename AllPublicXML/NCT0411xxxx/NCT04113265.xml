    <description>Skin electrical capacitance value was measured mono-laterally on the right or left inner arm, thigh and knee with Corneometer CM825 (Courage - Khazaka, Köln, Germany). The measure of the skin capacitance properties is an indirect expression of its hydration level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of skin density</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 48 hours after the last injection procedure, after 8 weeks, after 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A little skin area of about 7 cm2 (at level of inner arm was pinched, in standardized conditions, using a specific device. Because of this &quot;pinch&quot; the skin profile changes depending on cutaneous density; when the skin is slack the &quot;pinch&quot; forms a lot of wrinkles. A picture of the skin pinched was taken thanks to Primos compact portable device (GFMesstechnik); Primos software is able to measure skin principal profilometric parameters.</description>
