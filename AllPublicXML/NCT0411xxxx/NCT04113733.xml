  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of two major forms, Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis, affects more than 1.6 million people in the United States alone. Despite
      current therapies, remission only occurs in approximately half of patients. The goal of study
      is to map single-cell spatial relationships across the spectrum of ileum/ascending colon from
      healthy control patients to uninvolved/quiescent and involved/active CD patients and assess
      for relationships between single-cell data and patient clinical data.

      The investigators will utilize endoscopic mucosal biopsies and surgical resection specimens
      with rapid transfer of fresh tissue to the single-cell preparation for RNA-sequencing and use
      of tissues for RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization and multiplex immunofluorescence. Along
      with machine learning image analysis and bioinformatics, this will generate a robust/detailed
      single-cell gut cell atlas (GCA) of ileo-colonic CD at all disease activities versus normal
      tissues. The study will also compare the results of endoscopic mucosal biopsies to those
      obtained from full thickness surgical specimens by utilizing the Cooperative Human Tissue
      Network (CHTN).

      The investigators anticipate the GCA data will provide new insights into disease
      pathogenesis, leading to new therapeutic targets.

    <description>This group will consist of non-IBD patients and Crohn's disease patients participating in the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN). The CHTN will be utilized to obtain surgical specimens from these patients. The patients will be screened and consented via the CHTN protocol. No additional samples in the form of blood or stool will be collected. Associated clinical data will be collected through medical record review.</description>
