  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, new molecular agents enter the market with more and more patients receiving these
      treatments, especially in the metastatic setting. These molecular agents could correspond to
      immunotherapy and modulators of signaling pathways. More than 50% of cancer patients will
      receive radiation therapy during the course of their illness, including radiotherapy aimed a
      palliating symptoms secondary to metastatic diseases. Therefore, there will be an increasing
      number of patients who will be receiving radiotherapy while they are still receiving
      molecular agents. A better understanding of the interaction of these two treatment modalities
      is needed.

      Every year, new molecular agents enter the market with more and more patients receiving these
      treatments, especially in the metastatic setting. These molecular agents could correspond to
      immunotherapy and modulators of signaling pathways. More than 50% of cancer patients will

      number of patients who will be receiving radiotherapy while they are still receiving
      molecular agents. A better understanding of the interaction of these two treatment modalities
      is needed.

      It is within this context that this registry was set up to gather information from physicians
      and patients treated with molecular agents and radiation therapy. The information being
      collected include diagnosis, doses received, type of targeted therapy, side effects, etc.
      Through this registry, we wish to determine whether there are more Grade 3 or above side
      effects than what is reported in the literature for these treatment modalities, when given
      alone or in combination. Participating patients will also describe their perceived side
      effects and quality of life.
