  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the relationship between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and
      cardiovascular disease. MDS patients will be evaluated for the presence of mutations and
      whether they are associated with an increased risk of heart disease (CVD) and inflammation
      compared to healthy adults. Patients without symptoms of CVD will receive CT scans to assess
      for hidden disease and if that is related to their mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a type of blood cancer that can cause infection or
      bleeding because they prevent the formation of blood components and may lead to leukemia and
      death. MDS can arise from changes (or mutations) to a patient's DNA. MDS patients have
      increased risk of heart disease compared to healthy adults. The investigators will look for
      links between mutations in MDS patients and increased risk of heart disease. They will also
      use &quot;CT imaging&quot; to see if MDS patients have asymptomatic artery disease but may lead to
      heart disease in the future and if that is related to their mutations. The researcher will
      try to link mutations in MDS patients to markers of inflammation and to the amount of artery
      disease on CT imaging to look for patterns. The goal is to find certain mutations that are
      associated with inflammation and heart disease. This may ultimately allow hematologists to
      test MDS patients with these mutations for heart disease and/or treat them early so they have
      a better and longer life.
