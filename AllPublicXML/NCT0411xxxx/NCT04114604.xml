  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a larger grant, for which the overall goal is to collect measurements
      of liquid flow through the oropharynx (i.e., mouth and throat) during swallowing.The focus of
      this study is to evaluate the flow of liquids of varying consistency in the spinal disorder
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thickened liquids are commonly used as an intervention for dysphagia (swallowing impairment).
      However, the field lacks a clear understanding of how liquids of different consistencies
      behave during swallowing. In order to improve understanding of the effectiveness of altered
      liquid consistency for improving dysphagia, the investigators are studying liquid flow
      through the oropharynx. This study explores this question in individuals with spinal cord
      injury. Participants will swallow 20% w/v barium thickened to different consistencies (thin,
      slightly thick, mildly thick, moderately thick and extremely thick) using commercially
      available food thickeners. Swallowing will be observed under videofluoroscopy. Simultaneous
      measures of airflow via nasal cannula will be used to study respiratory-swallow coordination
      in this study sample.

    <measure>Penetration-Aspiration Scale (Swallow Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (single timepoint only)</time_frame>
    <description>The Penetration-Aspiration Scale (rosenbek et al., 1996) is an 8-point scale that will be used to characterize swallowing safety for each bolus trial based on the depth to which any material etners the airway and whether or not the material is ejected. Levels 1 and 2 on the scale are considered safe, while levels &gt; 3 are considered unsafe. Actual scale scores (1-8) will be recorded and then converted to binary categorical scores (&lt; 3 vs. &gt;/= 3).</description>

    <description>The direction of breathing (inspiration/expiration) airflow will be measured continuously via nasal cannula using the airflow module of the KayPentax Digital Swallow Workstation Swallowing Signals Lab. This information will be used to identify the direction of airflow immediately preceding and immediately following each swallow. An expiration-swallow-expiration pattern is considered normal. All other variants (inspiration-swallow-expiration, inspiration-swallow-expiration, expiration-swallow-inspiration) are considered abnormal.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Spinal cord injury at the cervical or thoracic level (T6 or higher)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of swallowing, motor speech, gastro‐esophageal difficulties, chronic
             sinusitis or taste disturbance.

          -  Neurological difficulties unrelated to spinal disorder (e.g. Stroke, Parkinson
             disease, etc).

          -  Cognitive communication difficulties that may hinder ability to participate.

          -  Current use of mechanical ventilation

          -  External instrumentation around the head/neck that would obstruct the field of view
             during the videofluoroscopy exam (e.g. cervical collar).

          -  Type 1 Diabetes (due to the requirement to swallow stimuli containing starch based
             thickeners, which carry a significant carbohydrate load).

          -  Known allergies to latex, food coloring or dental glue (due to the probability that
             these items will come into contact with the oral mucosa during data collection).

          -  Children and pregnant women (due to the use of radiation during the videofluoroscopic
             examination).
