  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is examining whether there is a relationship between
      preterm delivery and parental' problematic emotional bond in the early postpartum period.

      The secondary outcomes are as follows:

        -  To evaluate whether there are any differences and similarities between fathers' and
           mothers' level of parental bonding, stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms in case of
           premature birth.

        -  To evaluate whether there is a relationship between preterm delivery and the persistence
           of maternal' problematic emotional bond three months after childbirth.

        -  To indicate what kind of predictors might affect the parental' problematic bond in the
           early postpartum period.

    <description>Mean score of both parents of preterm babies hospitalized in NICU and parent of full-term babies on Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ). Total score of the PBQ, a parent-rated screening instrument for disorders of the early parent-infant relationship consisting of 25 statements on a six-point Likert scale (each 0-5; sum score ranging from 0 to 125; high = problematic).</description>

    <time_frame>From date of admitted to a NICU until discharge from hospital, assessed up to 7 days after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean score of parents of preterm infants hospitalized in NICU on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS is a 10-item validated self-report instrument assessing mothers' postpartum depressive symptoms, excluding somatic symptoms of depression that are common in new mothers (such as loss of energy, feeling tired, changes in appetite and sexual drive). Sum scores can range from 0 to 30, with high scores indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Mean score of both parents of preterm infants hospitalized in NICU on Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a self-report 7-item questionnaire serving as a screening tool and severity measure for generalized anxiety disorder. Sum scores can range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>From date of admitted to a NICU until discharge from hospital, assessed up to 7 days after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean score of both parents of preterm infants hospitalized in NICU on Parental Stress Scale (PSS). PSS is a self-report 18-item questionnaire that assesses stress associated with parenting. Sum scores can range from 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating higher stress.</description>
