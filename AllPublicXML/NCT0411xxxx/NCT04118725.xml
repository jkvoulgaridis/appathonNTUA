  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea in systemic sclerosis (ScS) constitute a major factor of functional disability.

      Intensity of dyspnea is sometimes discordant with objectives data from cardiopulmonary
      involvements, suggesting unknown additional factors.

      Diffuse fibrosing myopathy of bad prognosis have been reported in ScS.To now, muscular
      respiratory involvement has not been evaluated in ScS. Therefore, ScS patients (with or
      without dyspnea) could have underlying respiratory muscular involvement not detected by
      current standard of care with pulmonary function tests (PFT).

      This project is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to assess frequency of respiratory
      muscular involvement in ScS and to evaluate a screening strategy of this involvement.
