    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies whether glasdegib is helpful in treating sclerosis associated
      with chronic graft-versus-host disease. It will also investigate the safety of glasdegib in
      treating patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II study.

      Patients receive glasdegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR) in sclerotic manifestations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the starting glasdegib</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be calculated according to (1) the response definitions of the National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference for (a) skin or joint scores (0-3), where improvement by at least 1 point is a PR and return to score 0 is a complete (CR), or (b) the photographic range of motion scale (0-25) where improvement by at least 1 point is a partial response (PR) and return to score 25 is a CR; and (2) change in the 0-10 sclerotic severity scale where at least a 2 point improvement is a PR or return to 0 (CR).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ORR in all chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) manifestations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the starting glasdegib</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be calculated according to the response definitions of the NIH Consensus Conference. ORR both including and excluding skin sclerotic features will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Failure-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be estimated with events considered death, relapse, or start of another systemic immunosuppressive agent. Patients lost to follow-up or who withdraw consent will be censored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Burden Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will provide assessments of their symptom burden using a validated instrument recommended by the NIH Consensus on Chronic GVHD (Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale). These will be collected before starting glasdegib on day 1 of cycle 1, and again on day (D)1, cycles 4, 7, 10 and end of treatment. Summary scores will be calculated based on published algorithms with absolute changes from baseline and clinically meaningful changes described for the population as a whole and based on CR+PR versus (vs.) stable disease (SD)+mixed response (MR)+progressive disease (PD), when adequate data are available for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will provide assessments of their quality of life using the NIH-endorsed Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29. These will be collected before starting glasdegib on day 1 of cycle 1, and again on day (D)1, cycles 4, 7, 10 and end of treatment. Scores for physical functioning will be calculated based on published algorithms with absolute changes from baseline and clinically meaningful changes described for the population as a whole and based on CR+PR versus (vs.) stable disease (SD)+mixed response (MR)+progressive disease (PD), when adequate data are available for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Biologic impact of hedgehog pathway inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aim to discern the biologic impact of Hedgehog pathway inhibition in the treatment of cGVHD and may include the following skin assays as well as others: expression of Shh, Gli1, Gli2, ptch-2, collagen, TGFb, and Smo. Immunohistochemistry may be performed for Patched, Shh, Snail, GSK3-beta, beta-catenin, or Ihh as well as other markers.</description>
