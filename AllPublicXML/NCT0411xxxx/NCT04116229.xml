  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of obesity in the United States is high and is a risk factor for concurrent
      cognitive impairment and, in late life, dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. In order to
      prevent or reduce cognitive impairment, the mechanism underlying the link between obesity and
      cognitive impairment must be understood. The current study aims to provide preliminary data
      on whether brain inflammation occurs in obesity and relates to cognitive deficits using
      magnetic resonance neuroimaging and cognitive testing. It is hypothesized that obese
      individuals will have greater brain inflammation and lower cognitive function compared to
      normal-weight individuals. Further, it is predicted that brain inflammation will relate to
      cognitive function and plasma indicators of inflammation in obese individuals.

      Initially, normal-weight or obese potential participants are screened by a phone interview
      that assesses medical history. Obtainment of informed consent and further screening occurs on
      the day of the study visit. Participants then undergo a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) including blood draws for metabolic and inflammatory marker levels in plasma. Lunch is
      then provided. Participants are then administered 30 minute computer-based cognitive testing
      from the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. After cognitive testing, participants undergo 1.5
      hour magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that includes structural, diffusion tensor, and
      functional MR imaging.

    <measure>Brain Inflammation Metrics in Obese and Normal-weight Individuals as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Image-based Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 hours at the end of one (up to) 8 hour study day that includes all outcome measures</time_frame>
    <description>Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (Cross and Song, 2017) is a computational method that will be applied to diffusion tensor images of the brain to estimate putative inflammation-related markers including cellularity and edema in obese and normal-weight individuals. DBSI metrics are quantitative but unitless. Cellularity and edema fractions of the total diffusion signal (including axial, radial, restricted (cellularity) and hindered (edema)) will be estimated.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Function in Obese and Normal-weight Individuals as Measured by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognitive Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>40 minutes during one (up to) 8 hour study day that includes all outcome measures; after OGTT and prior to MRI</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance including fluid and crystallized cognition composite T-scores from computer-based NIH Cognitive Toolbox assessments (Weintraub et al., 2013) will be assessed in obese and normal-weight individuals. These T-scores will include scores from tasks that assess attention and executive functioning, episodic memory, working memory, language, processing speed, and immediate recall (see NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery website).</description>

    <measure>Peripheral Inflammation in Obese and Normal-weight Individuals as Measured by Plasma Assays</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes during one (up to) 8 hour study day that includes all outcome measures; blood draw prior to OGTT</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma will be isolated from whole blood prior to the 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and frozen for laboratory analyses. Peripheral inflammatory markers of interest including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1B, total adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2, toll receptor 4, and C-reactive protein will be measured using radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in a wet laboratory.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic Markers in Plasma in Obese and Normal-weight individuals.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours during one (up to) 8 hour study day that includes all outcome measures; first activity of the study day</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma will be isolated from whole blood drawn at each OGTT time point and frozen. Insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta function will be quantified using the oral glucose minimal model, which requires C-peptide, insulin, and glucose levels in plasma at fasting and throughout the 2 hour OGTT (Breda et al., 2001). Peripheral metabolic markers including C-peptide, insulin, and glucose levels in plasma will be measured for each timepoint of the OGTT using electrochemiluminescence, hexokinase ultraviolet method, and radioimmunoassay in a wet laboratory.</description>

    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be performed in a 3 Tesla MRI scanner over 1.5 hours. Participants will be asked to lay down flat on their backs and to try to stay still throughout the MRI scan. The participant will wear MRI-safe headphones to block out noise due to the MRI scans. Participant comfort will be verbally checked on throughout the scan and the participant will be provided with a 'squeeze ball' to signal the MRI technician that they want to get out of the scanner immediately.</description>
