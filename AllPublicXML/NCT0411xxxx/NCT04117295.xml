      Feasibility study of the Carmat TAH as a treatment for transplant-eligible patients in
      severe, end-stage heart failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, staged feasibility study designed to assess the initial
      evidence of safety and performance of the Carmat TAH in the treatment of severe, end-stage
      heart failure. This study will include up to 7 centers in the US. The study population will
      include up to 10 transplant-eligible patients enrolled and implanted with the Carmat TAH.

      Data collection will be recorded prior to implantation of the device and for six months
      following implant, then long term at 9, 12, 18 and 24 months while the patient remains on the
      device. Adverse events, as defined by INTERMACS, while on device support will be collected
      throughout the study until study closure and will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical
      Event Committee.

      Progress reports of the clinical outcomes will be reviewed by the DSMB after implantation of
      each patient and every three months thereafter while any patient is supported with the
      device. A progress report will be sent to FDA for review after three subjects have been
      implanted and followed for 60 days.

      The primary objective of the study is survival on an original Carmat device at 180 days
      post-implant or survival to cardiac transplantation if occurring before 180 days
      post-implant.

    <description>Measured with the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire, a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of five responses (EQ-5D-5L). The responses record five levels of severity (1:no problems; 2:slight problems; 3:moderate problems 4:severe problems; 5:extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension.
Measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
