  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of repeat administration of
      darvadstrocel in participants with Crohn's Disease (CD) and complex perianal fistula by
      evaluation of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special
      interest (AESIs), and special situation reports (SSRs).

    <textblock>
      The biological being tested in this study is called darvadstrocel (Alofisel). This study is
      examining the long-term safety of a repeat dose of Darvadstrocel in people who have Crohn's
      Disease and Complex Perianal Fistula.

      The study will enroll approximately 50 patients. Participants will be assigned to one
      treatment group to receive:

      â€¢ Darvadstrocel 120 million cells

      All participants would be allowed to receive one repeat dose of darvadstrocel in the whole
      study. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 6, 24, 52, 104, and 156 post-repeat administration</time_frame>
    <description>The PDAI is a scoring system to evaluate the severity of perianal lesion associated with Crohn's disease. It includes the following 5 items: (a) discharge; (b) pain; (c) restriction of sexual activity; (d) type of perianal disease; and (e) degree of induration. Each item is graded on a 5-point scale ranging from no symptoms (score of 0) to severe symptoms (score of 4) and total range of score is from 0 to 20. Higher score means more severe disease.</description>

         14. The participant has had major surgery of the gastrointestinal tract within 6 months
             before screening, including local perianal surgery, other than curettage/draining for

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
