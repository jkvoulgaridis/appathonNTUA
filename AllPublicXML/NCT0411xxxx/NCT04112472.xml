  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the clinical performance of the
      investigational device. To that end, the Limits of Agreement with respect to comparator
      devices are analyzed. The Limits of Agreement allow estimating the expected measurement
      deviation per measurand, which is compared to the &quot;maximum acceptable measurement error&quot;, as
      defined by the Risk Analysis of the investigational device, to assess the risk involved in
      measurements of the investigational device. Furthermore, the in-vivo repeatability will be
      quantified for each measurand, as well as the confidence intervals for mean deviation with
      respect to the current gold standard device.

      As a secondary objective of the study, raw measurement data will be collected to allow for
      improvement of existing algorithms, development of additional measurands and for
      retrospective analysis.
