    <textblock>
      To verify the role of nab-paclitaxel in second or later-line treatment in advanced biliary
      tract cancers, the investigators designed a prospective, exploratory, single arm,single
      center phase II trial, to investigate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel combined with
      cisplatin as second or later-line treatment in advanced biliary tract cancers.
