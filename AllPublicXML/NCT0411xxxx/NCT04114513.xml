  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled multicenter study will be held in parallel
      groups. During 5 weeks the efficacy of different endpoints as a measure of response to the
      daily intake of dietary fibers (8 g of either inulin, pectin, beta-glucan or
      galactooligosaccharides) will be evaluated. Gut microbiota composition, lipids levels,
      inflammation markers, microbiome metabolites, changes in quality of life and stool parameters
      will be assessed in order to predict individual response in participants without serious
      chronic diseases

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized double-blinded study will include 270 volunteers without clinical manifestations
      of chronic diseases. Participants will be randomized into one of five arms daily consuming
      one of the following: placebo (maltodextrin, 8 g), inulin (8 g), pectin (8 g), beta-glucan (8
      g) or oligosaccharides (8 g).

      The study will include a 5-day screening period and a 5-weeks intervention period.

      During screening stage, a volunteer will complete a questionnaire, and the following
      measurements will be performed: blood levels of glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, lipids,
      C-reactive protein, anthropometric measurements, as well as cardiovascular risk will be
      assessed.

      Before and after the intervention blood and stool samples will be collected to conduct the
      following analyses: an extended lipid spectrum analysis, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      16S rRNA gut microbiome sequencing, laboratory stool testing, stool fecal short-chain fatty
      acids analysis. Anthropometric measures, physical examination will be performed for each
      volunteer. The following questionnaires will be completed: dietary recall questionnaire,
      SF-36, the Rome Criteria for the Functional gastrointestinal disorders (functional
      constipation). The assessed scales will include Bristol stool scale, Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale (HADS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD).

In addition to scores for individual dimensions, two summary scores assessing physical and mental dimensions of health and well-being can also be calculated: Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score, respectively</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Patients anxiety and depression will be assessed using the HADS : Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale.
Scores of the HADS scale can be defined as:
By adding the points of the answers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13: we obtain the &quot;Total A&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the anxiety, then:
7 or less: absence of symptomatology; 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology; 11 and above: certain symptomatology.
By adding the points of the answers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14: we obtain the &quot;Total B&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the depression, then:
7 or less: absence of symptomatology; 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology; 11 and above: certain symptomatology. The minimal score is 0 and the maximal total score is 42.</description>
