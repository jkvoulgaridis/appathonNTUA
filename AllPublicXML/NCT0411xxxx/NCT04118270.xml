    <textblock>
      Shared Decision-Making: AFib 2gether™ is a research study that focuses on a mobile
      application developed by Pfizer, Inc with consultation from Dr McManus' called AFib 2gether™.
      Through this app, patients can determine their risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation and
      prioritize questions and concerns for discussion with their cardiology provider.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of the AFib 2gether app during cardiology visits to facilitate treatment discussion and plans for anticoagulation therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patient/Provider interactions will be recorded in an encrypted manner and then encoded for mention/use or absence of discussion of the application within the interaction to indicate use or nonuse of the application. A high score indicates high overall usage and a low score indicates low overall usage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concurrence of Provider Risk Assessment and App Risk Assessment for Stroke.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's cardiovascular provider will be queried to assess whether the patient's risk score as calculated by the app correlates with the provider's own assessment of patient risk. This feedback is obtained through a post-visit questionnaire which includes questions about app impressions including accuracy of score. A positive score will indicate that the app risk score matched the provider's risk score, and a negative score will indicate that the app score did not match the provider's risk score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of provider knowledge on stroke risk and atrial fibrillation to utility of app to guide clinical decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after visit</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's cardiovascular provider will be evaluated on knowledge of stroke risk and atrial fibrillation treatment options prior to patient visit, and then asked to assess whether or not the application was useful in the clinical decision-making process related to placing the patient on anti-coagulation therapy. If the application was used by provider and patient during treatment discussion, the provider is asked to rank the utility of the application and to indicate on a scale of &quot;strongly disagree&quot;, &quot;somewhat disagree&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;somewhat agree&quot; and &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; to if the app was helpful in making this determination. Answers closer to the strongly agree side will indicate perceived usefulness of the application. If the answers are closer to the strongly disagree side, this will indicate that the app was less useful.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Anticoagulation status of patients pre and post status cardiology visit as determined by the CHA2DS2-VASc2 score.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the patient's cardiovascular provider places the patient on anticoagulation therapy due to a sufficiently high CHA2DS2-VASc2 score as identified by the app and the provider. Additionally, we will be testing if there is agreement between the CHA2DS2-VASc2 score determined by the application and the cardiology provider.</description>
