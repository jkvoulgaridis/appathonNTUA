  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common and debilitating skin disease that is poorly
      understood and understudied. As a result, little is known about disease prognosis and few
      effective treatments exist for this condition. This prospective observational cohort study
      aims to comprehensively characterize the clinical and biological features of HS. The results
      of this research will provide a basis for the development of an HS clinical classification
      system and identification of potential treatments for HS.
