  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate changes in lateral hip muscle strength as well as
      self-reported pain during the performance of three functional tests in patients with anterior
      knee pain following a lumbopelvic thrust-mobilization.

      Hypothesis(es):

      Lumbar thrust-mobilization will lead to increased lateral hip strength and decreased anterior
      knee pain during 3 functional activities (single leg step down, functional squat, drop jump).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The participant will complete a medical history form and undergo a brief physical exam of the
      lumbar spine and knees to include: lumbar range of motion and mobility testing, knee range of
      motion, palpation, and knee mobility testing. The participant will complete a hip strength
      test utilizing the Biodex System 4 Pro®. The participant will then perform three activities
      (single leg step down, squat, and drop jump from a 2 foot platform) and provide a
      self-reported knee pain measure with each activity. A sealed envelope indicating the
      intervention to be received will be given to the participant. An investigator blinded to the
      pre and post-measures will open the envelope indicating the intervention to be performed. The
      participant will be blinded to which intervention group they are categorized to. Th e
      participant will be positioned on a high-low treatment table to receive the assigned
      ﻿intervention. The participant will be positi﻿oned to receive either intervent﻿ion 1 (thrust
      mobilization) or 2 (sham mobilization)﻿﻿﻿. The participant will either receive the
      thrust-mobilization or sham mobilization up to 2 times on the left and right side. An
      immediate re-test of hip strength will be conducted followed by performing the same three
      functional activities (single leg step down, squat, and drop jump from a 2 foot platform)
      while providing a self-reported pain measure after each activity. Follow-up measures at 15
      minutes post-intervention and the final measure at 30 minutes post-intervention will be
      performed.

    <description>The intervention group will receive passive spinal rotational grade V thrust-mobilization, based on Maitland's approach. The intervention will be performed with the subject in right sidelying and left sidelying. The operator's palpating hand is placed over the L2-3 intervertebral space, and the other hand bends both legs of the participant up to the range at which the L2-3 midposition is found. The participant is then asked to straighten the lower leg and hook the upper leg over it with the upper leg's knee positioned over the side of the plinth. While the lower component is kept still, the participant's trunk is rotated until the hip starts to lift off from the plinth. The bottom hand and uppermost hand rest under a pillow and the chest wall, respectively. With the starting position settled, the operator stands behind the participant, takes up the slack within the spine and then provides a grade V thrust- mobilization while stabilizing the uppermost shoulder.</description>

    <description>Subjects are positioned in right sidelying. The experimenter holds both knees with one arm while placing their opposite hand on the participant's lumbar spine. The experimenter performs 1 min of ﬂexion and extension passive range of motion without reaching physiological end range in either direction of movement. This is repeated with the subject in left sidelying.</description>
