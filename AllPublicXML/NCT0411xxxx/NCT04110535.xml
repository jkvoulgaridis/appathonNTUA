          2. Male and female adults, between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) within 19.0 to 33.0 kg/m2, inclusive (minimum weight of at least
             50.0 kg at Screening).

          4. Healthy, as determined by having no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, or laboratory (including hematology, clinical
             chemistry, urinalysis, and serology) findings, as judged by the investigator.

          5. Recreational CNS depressant user, defined as follows:

               1. ≥ 10 lifetime non-therapeutic experiences (ie, for psychoactive effects) with CNS
                  depressants (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, zolpidem, zopiclone,
                  propofol/fospropofol, gamma-hydroxybutyrate)

               2. ≥ 1 non-therapeutic use of a CNS depressant within the 8 weeks prior to Screening

               3. ≥ 1 non-therapeutic use of benzodiazepines within the 12 months prior to
                  Screening

          6. Must pass Qualification Phase (Drug Discrimination and Tolerability) eligibility
             criteria (Section 9.3.1 and 9.3.2, respectively).

          7. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential (postmenopausal, with &gt; 1 year
             since last menses and a follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt; 40 mIU/mL, or
             surgically or congenitally sterile), or, if of childbearing potential, must be using
             and willing to continue using highly effective contraception, defined as methods of
             birth control that result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used
             consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized
             partner, for at least 1 month prior to Screening (at least 3 months for oral and
             transdermal contraceptives) and for at least 14 days after last study drug
             administration.

          8. Able to speak, read, and understand English sufficiently to allow completion of all
             study assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Drug or alcohol dependence within the 12 months prior to Screening (except nicotine),
             as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Man ual of Mental Disorders, fourth
             edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), or any self-reported dependence or &quot;addiction&quot;

          2. Subjects who have ever been in treatment for substance use disorder(s) (except smoking
             cessation).

          3. History or presence of any clinically significant cardiac, psychiatric, endocrine,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
             dermatologic, renal, or other major disease at Screening, which in the opinion of the
             investigator would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the study
             results, including subjects with chronic renal failure or congestive heart failure.

          4. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject was at risk for respiratory
             depression, including subjects with obstructive apnea, upper airway obstruction,
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia,
             or other severe cardio-respiratory disease.

             cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors or respiratory depressants, or could not safely
             discontinue these medications within 7 days or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to receiving study drug in the Qualification Phase and for the Duration of the
             study.

         10. Subject was using an investigational drug or device or had used such within the 30
             days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to first drug administration in the
             Qualification Phase.

         11. Female subjects who were pregnant or lactating or who were planning to become pregnant
