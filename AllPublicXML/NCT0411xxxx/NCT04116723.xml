  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is the three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the spine and trunk. The majority or 80%
      of the scoliosis cases are idiopathic which means that the cause is unknown. The progression
      of scoliosis is much more frequently seen in females and severely scoliotic patients face a
      higher risk of different health problems in their adult life Bracing is the most commonly
      used non-invasive treatment for patients with smaller spinal curves which are usually between
      21 and 40 degrees at Risser stage 0, 1 or 2. However, scoliosis braces are traditionally
      constructed based on the experience of orthotists. Since 3D spinal deformities are complex,
      the design and evaluation of braces are challenging with no consensus on an optimal brace
      design. AI and ML methods therefore constitute a new approach to address the difficulties in
      designing braces.

    <textblock>
      The designs of flexible brace include: an artificial hinge bone is used to stabilize the
      corrective components. Corrective straps are attached to the artificial hinge to exert
      corrective forces onto the scoliotic spine. Semi-rigid silicon pads with high conformability
      to the body are used to enhance the corrective forces.

      This study is a multi-disciplinary collaborative project with experts in computer science,
      orthopaedics, materials science, garment technology, engineering and biomechanics. A
      biomechanical computational model will be developed to recommend modifications to the
      flexible brace design. The effectiveness of the flexible braces will be evaluated through
      low-dose X-ray radiography at pre-, post-expert and post-ML designed treatment. A polynomial
      scoring system will be created to assess the therapeutic similarity of the ML-designed
      flexible brace to the expert-designed flexible brace based on an estimate of the corrective
      forces applied through the braces. Reinforcement learning with scores based on estimated
      pressure force will guide AI training towards superior therapeutic designs.

    <description>The design of the flexible brace incorporates different mechanisms, such as 1) compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel, 2) artificial hinge bone for the strategical application and fixation of corrective panel, 3) lumbar flexion by using supporting belt, 3) transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket lining by using the principle of the 3-point pressure system.</description>

    <description>Participants will be invited to undergo a fitting session of a flexible brace. After the fitting session, participants will join a two-hours wear trial of the flexible brace. Participants are required to wear the brace for two-hours and undergo assessments before and after the wear trial. The measurement outcomes of the assessment include 1) X-ray scan, 2) 3D body scan, 3) garment pressure, and 4) questionnaire.</description>
