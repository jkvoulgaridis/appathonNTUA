  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK. It develops through smaller growths
      in the bowel called polyps. Early recognition and removal of these polyps result in
      prevention of developing bowel cancer in an individual. However, not all polyps will lead to
      cancer, certain polyps are just growths of normal tissue and can be left in the bowel. We
      therefore need to know which polyps to remove and which ones to leave. One way of doing this
      is to have a better look at these polyps. This can be done by new technologies. One of them
      is called Blue Light Imaging (BLI). This is a new light source at the end of the camera which
      is activated by the push of a button. It will help us in looking at these polyps more
      closely.

      This helps us decide which polyps to remove and which ones are safe to leave as there is
      always a small risk in removing a polyp. It would also give us a better idea as to when to
      repeat the camera test if necessary (endoscopic surveillance). By reducing the number of
      polyps resected and sent to the pathology labs for diagnosis, the work load on the pathology
      department is also reduced and in the process, providing cost savings to the Trust, The study
      aims to see if using Blue Light during endoscopy helps us to identify and characterize small
      polyps better

      Advanced endoscopic imaging can facilitate the characterisation of neoplastic and
      non-neoplastic polyps. Accurate identification of small non-neoplastic polyps (e.g.
      rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps) that do not harbour malignant potential can lead to future
      implementation of a 'resect and discard' or 'diagnose and leave' strategy. However, there is
      insufficient evidence that endoscopists are able to attain high enough levels of optical
      diagnostic performance in-vivo in order to implement this strategy safely. Blue Light Imaging
      (BLI) is a new enhanced imaging technology that enhances mucosal surface and vessel patterns.
      A specific BLI classification was recently developed to enable better characterisation of
      colorectal polyps (BLI Adenoma Serrated International Classification - BASIC). The use of
      this technology with the appropriate classification to enhance its performance has not yet
      been tested in clinical settings of polyp surveillance and screening colonoscopy amongst
      general endoscopists.

      BLAST is a multicentre prospective observational study which will compare BLI optical
      diagnosis with histological assessment (as a reference standard) for patients with small
      polyps (&lt;10mm) identified at colonoscopy.
