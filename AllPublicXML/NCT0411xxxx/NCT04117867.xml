      The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the severity and duration of
      intraoperative hypotension and the incidence of perioperative stroke after non-cardiac and
      non-neurologic surgeries.The secondary aim of this study is to confirm the potential risk
      factors of the perioperative stroke.

    <textblock>
      Optimized intraoperative management may play an important role in perioperative stroke
      prevention. Maintaining blood pressure near preoperative baseline values may help decrease
      the incidence of stroke, however the related evidence is limited.Therefore, this study is to
      investigate the association between intraoperative hemodynamic variable and the risk of
      perioperative stroke after non-cardiac and non-neurologic surgeries. The secondary aim of
      this study is to establish the potential risk factors of the perioperative stroke.

    <description>In this study, we will use four previously defined thresholds for intraoperative hypotension: two absolute thresholds (MAP less than 50 mmHg and MAP less than 60 mmHg) and two relative thresholds to the baseline MAP (a decrease of 30% or more and a decrease of 40% or more). A definition of baseline value most frequently reported was the arterial blood pressure before the induction of anesthesia. Therefore, the baseline MAP used in calculating the relative thresholds is defined as the mean MAP of all available blood pressure measurements before induction of anesthesia in the operating room.</description>
