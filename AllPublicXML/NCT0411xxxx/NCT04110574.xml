      The ability to predict stone composition, which influences patient treatment, depends on the
      accurate measurement of CT attenuation of stones. We will study the effects of stone
      composition, stone size, and scan collimation width on the measurement of attenuation in
      vitro.

      Recently, the use of noncontrast spiral computerized tomography (NCCT) has gained widespread
      acceptance in the evaluation of urinary stone patients. It has long been used clinically to
      evaluate the causes of radiolucent filling defects using Hounsfield units (HU) to distinguish
      calculi from tumor or blood clots, and to identify nonurologic causes of flank pain (Smith R
      etal ). Urinary stones have a significantly higher CT attenuation than the surrounding soft
      tissues and are virtually always visible on NCCT. Knowing the composition of a urinary
      calculus is frequently a key factor in determining its most appropriate management. Should
      the urine be alkalinized? Will the stone be amenable to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
      (ESWL), or should ureteroscopy or percutaneous lithotripsy be attempted? Different techniques
      have been used to assist in determining the correct chemical composition of calculi. Urine
      pH, urinary crystals, prior stone history and the presence of urea-splitting organisms
      (Ramakumar S,etal). Several in vitro studies have suggested that NCCT can demonstrate
      measured differences in radiodensity among different urinary stones (Mitchenson HD
      etal,).With these clinical problems in mind, we sought to determine whether the composition
      of urinary calculi could be predicted by their CT characteristics in an attempt to find out
      the best technique for distinguishing the various stones compositions, provided that it is
      clinically practical and would not require repeated imaging of the patients.
