      A multi-center, open-label clinical pharmacology trial to investigate the PK, tolerability,
      and safety of brexpiprazole QW formulation administered as single and multiple doses.

      The trial comprises the single-dose period (Cohort 1) and the multiple-dose period (Cohort
      2). The dose used in the multiple-dose period (Cohort 2) will be determined based on plasma
      drug concentrations obtained in the single-dose period (Cohort 1).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia based on the Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5)

          2. Patients capable of staying at the trial site from the day before investigational
             medicinal product (IMP) administration to the 8th day following IMP administration in
             both Period 1 and Period 2

          3. Patients with a body mass index [BMI = body weight (kg)/height (m)2] of 18.5 or higher
             and lower than 35.0 at screening

          4. Persons who provide written informed consent before commencement of any trial-related
             procedures and whom the investigator or subinvestigator judges to be capable of
             following all the conditions of this trial

          5. Patients who, in the judgement of the investigator or subinvestigator, have stable
             psychotic symptoms maintained by administration of an antipsychotic (other than
             clozapine) within the dosing range indicated separately, before commencement of
             investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of a concurrent mental disorder besides schizophrenia
             (schizoaffective disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, bipolar II
             disorder, general anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic

          2. Patients who fail to meet the specified requisite washout periods for the prohibited
             concomitant drugs and foods before commencement of IMP administration, or patients who
             are anticipated to take any of these drugs or foods during the study period

          3. Patients who have previously undergone gastrointestinal surgery that could affect
             pharmacokinetic evaluations

          4. Patients who are using clozapine at the time of informed consent

          5. Patients who have received electro-convulsive therapy within 60 days before
             commencement of IMP administration

          6. Patients with clinically problematic disorders of the nervous system, liver, kidneys,
             metabolic system, blood, immune system, cardiovascular system, lungs, or digestive
             system (However, such patients may be included if the condition is mild or
             well-controlled and is considered to not affect safety or pharmacokinetic
             evaluations.)
