  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to

        1. find out if the study drugs (ipilimumab plus nivolumab) in combination with cryotherapy
           will help participants with metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma;.

        2. find out how safe are ipilimumab plus nivolumab given in combination with cryotherapy,
           and what side effects may be related to treatment.

        3. find out how do the study drugs in combination with cryotherapy work in soft tissue
           sarcoma.

      Primary Objectives:

      1) Assess whether the rate of clinical benefit is sufficiently high to merit promise for
      further study

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Characterize the 6-month progression-free survival rate

        2. Assess whether the treatment yields a reasonably safe and tolerable profile

    <description>Clinical response was assessed per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria:
Complete response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions; all lymph nodes &lt; 10 mm on the short axis; no new lesions.
Partial response (PR) = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; no new lesions.
Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria; no new lesions.
Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s). Clinical Response Rate =CR+PR. The outcome is expressed as the total number of participants who achieve a clinical response by 16 weeks, a number without dispersion.</description>
