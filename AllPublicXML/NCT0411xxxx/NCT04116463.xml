  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to extend the CDSMP to lower-wage populations aged
      40-64 years by partnering with public libraries and employment support networks in select
      North Carolina counties. The specific aims of this research are to (1) test the effects of
      the CDSMP on employment and health outcomes among lower-wage working adults 40-64 years of
      age at 6 and 12 months from baseline, and explore the extent to which they are modified by
      select sociodemographic, chronic condition, and work-related factors, (2) conduct an economic
      evaluation of the CDSMP for employers (return on investment [ROI]), the health care system
      (ROI), and state governments (cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)), and (3) assess factors
      associated with the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of the CDSMP among
      lower-wage workers using social marketing strategies designed to overcome program engagement
      and participation challenges that exist in this population.

      To evaluate the CDSMP's effect on key employment outcomes, an experienced team from the
      UNC-CH Prevention Research Center (PRC) will leverage its long-standing partnerships with
      employer networks, public libraries and community agencies throughout the state and the NC
      Division of Aging's network of 500 active CDSMP interventionists to conduct the proposed
      work. This research will produce new knowledge about CDSMP effects by (1) testing it in a
      high chronic disease burden population of employed, lower-wage adults in their preretirement
      years (ages 40-64), (2) focusing on employment productivity and cost-specific outcomes that
      would have direct relevance for employers, insurers, and policy-makers, and (3) targeting
      recruitment and CDSMP delivery to enhance uptake by lower-wage workers. The specific aims of
      the proposed study are to:

        1. Test the effects of the CDSMP on employment and health outcomes among lower-wage working
           adults 40-64 years of age at 6 and 12 months from baseline, and explore the extent to
           which they are modified by select sociodemographic, chronic condition, and work-related
           factors. The primary study outcome is work productivity, measured as lost productivity
           time using Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) absenteeism and presenteeism
           scores. Secondary study outcomes reflect health dimensions that are typically evaluated
           in relation to CDSMP delivery, and include measures of: chronic disease management
           self-efficacy, self management behaviors, health status, and healthcare utilization.

        2. Conduct an economic evaluation of the CDSMP for employers (return on investment [ROI]),
           the health care system (ROI), and state governments (cost-effectiveness analysis [CEA]).

        3. Assess factors associated with the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of
           the CDSMP among lower-wage workers using social marketing strategies designed to
           overcome program engagement and participation challenges that exist in this population.

    <measure>Mean Work Limitations Questionnaire-25 Score 6M: Percent productivity loss due to presenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) is a patient self-rated scale designed to assess on the- job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment. The WLQ consists of 25 items in 4 dimensions: limitations handling time (5 items), physical work demands (6 items), mental interpersonal work demands (9 items), and output demands (5 items). Each item is rated on a 5- point scale from &quot;All of the Time&quot; (score 5) to &quot;None of the Time&quot; (score 0), or &quot;Does Not Apply to My Job&quot;. The WLQ Productivity Loss Score is derived from the Global Productivity Index, which is calculated as a weighed sum of the 4 dimensions. Reduction in WLQ Productivity Loss score indicates less work limitation and represents the estimated percentage of productivity loss in the past two weeks due to presenteeism relative to a healthy benchmark sample. WLQ Productivity Loss Score ranges from 0% to 24.9%. Higher percent productivity loss reflects more severe work limitations.</description>

    <measure>Mean Work Limitations Questionnaire-4 Score 6M: Percent productivity loss due to absenteeism</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of productivity lost due to work absences is the ratio of total missed work hours to total usual work hours in a two-week time frame. Both the numerator (total missed work hours due to health problems or medical care) and the denominator (total usual work hours) are computed based on information from four survey questions (two required and two optional), which are included in the WLQ Work Absence Module. Productivity loss due to absenteeism can range from 0% to 100%, with higher percent loss meaning more absenteeism.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>5 items internally constructed by research team members to reflect adherence over past month; proportions of participants in each group will be compared. Dichotomous items (No=0/Yes=1) include forgetting to take regularly scheduled medications, problems remembering to take regularly scheduled medication, stopping regularly scheduled medication when feeling better, stopping regularly scheduled medication when feeling worse. Participants responding they forgot to take regularly scheduled medication complete a 5th nominally-scaled item that asks how frequently they have forgotten to take in the past month (1 time =1, 2 times=2, 3 times=3, 4 times=4, 5 times=5, More than 5 times=6). Higher proportions on dichotomous items reflects worse within-group adherence. Higher mean scores on nominally-scaled item reflects worse within-group adherence.</description>

    <ipd_description>UNC will prepare de-identified limited-access dataset suitable for sharing with other researchers. De-identification will include removal of obvious identifiers such as names and addresses. It will also include examination of less obvious potentially identifying variables. Continuous variables with extreme values may have the extremes truncated. Height and weight are examples of such variables. Categorical variables with small numbers of participants in some categories may have these categories pooled with larger categories.</ipd_description>
