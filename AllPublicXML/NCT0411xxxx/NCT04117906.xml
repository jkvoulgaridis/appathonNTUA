  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a brief, online self-help,
      anxiety management training course ('STAGE') with a wait-list control. A battery of
      self-report measures will be administered online at baseline (week 0), post-intervention
      (week 3) and at follow-up (week 5).
