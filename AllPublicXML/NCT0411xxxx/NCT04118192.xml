    <textblock>
      A prospective non-randomised multi-centre feasibility study to assess if patients with
      residual cancer following dual-targeted neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment for HER2-positive,
      ER-negative early breast cancer can be identified by multiple ultrasound (US)-guided tumour
      bed core biopsies

      The NOSTRA-Feasibility study is designed to determine if it is safe to omit surgery after the
      planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus dual-targeted anti-HER2 treatment. The study is needed
      to determine whether patients with residual cancer can be identified by histological
      examination of multiple ultrasound-guided tumour bed core biopsies following dual-targeted
      neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-positive, ER-negative early primary breast cancer and whether
      there is concordance between local pathology reporting and central pathology reporting by the
      trials expert pathologists.
