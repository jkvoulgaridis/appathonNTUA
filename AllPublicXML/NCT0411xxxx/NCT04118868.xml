  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, pembrolizumab will be administered via DoseConnect in patient with
      relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to assess through pharmacodynamic assessment
      in the tumor tissue to assess if lymphatic delivery of pembrolizumab using Sofusa DoseConnect
      is feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center pilot study to investigate the pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and activity of pembrolizumab administered intra-lymphatically
      using the DoseConnect in participants with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL).

      All participants will receive the study intervention, pembrolizumab administered
      intralymphatically using the Sofusa DoseConnect device.
