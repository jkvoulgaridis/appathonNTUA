  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program at
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital to care for older adults in the emergency department. Half of
      the patients will be cared for by a standard ED team plus the GEDI team, while half of the
      patients will receive usual ED care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization is common for older adults in the Emergency Department (ED) but it carries
      significant risks including the development of delirium, falls, and nosocomial infections.
      The Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program at Northwestern Memorial
      Hospital attempts to identify and address health related risks for older adults without
      exposing them to the risks of hospitalization,. GEDI is a unique program consisting of a
      multidisciplinary team of Transitional Care Nurses (TCN), social workers, pharmacists,
      occupational therapists and physical therapists who perform ED-based geriatric assessment and
      care coordination.

      To determine the impact of GEDI on health services use and Health Related Quality-of-Life
      (HRQoL) we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing GEDI compared to usual ED
      care(which often involves hospitalization).

    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Preference (PROPr) score summarizes multiple domains into a single score anchored at 0 (as bad as dead) and 1 (perfect or ideal health). This score quantifies the value that individuals place on different states of health. Preference-based scores can be used in cost-utility analyses and to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
PROPr is calculated from the scores for the 7 PROMIS domains: Cognition, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities.
Preference-based scores PROMIS domain scores can be calculated using the HealthMeasures Scoring Service. The HealthMeasures Scoring Service export includes PROMIS theta values used to calculate PROPr using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) which is available at https://github.com/janelhanmer/PROPr</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Physical Function (Adaptive)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Item Bank uses Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) in which participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (165 items in total in adult bank). Although items differ across respondents taking CAT, scores are comparable across participants.
Measure Description: PROMIS subscale for physical function assesses the extent to which patients' perceived capability rather than actual performance of physical activities using a 5-point Likert scale. PROMIS uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. T-scores range from 20 to 80. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured.</description>
