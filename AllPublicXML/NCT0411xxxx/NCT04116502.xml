    <textblock>
      The trial will be a phase III, randomised-controlled, multi-centre, international, open-label
      trial consisting of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy, where best available therapy
      is a choice of interferon alpha, any formulation permitted (IFN) or hydroxycarbamide (HC),
      and which will be elected by the Investigator prior to randomisation.

      There will be no cross-over either between arm A and B or between therapies on Arm B

      HC and IFN will be provided as best available therapy, IFN can include standard of
      pegylated-interferon at Investigators discretion.
