  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge-Eating-Disorder (BED) is a common eating disorder characterized by recurring episodes
      of uncontrollable eating. The underlying neural mechanisms are largely unknown. However,
      dysfunctional hormonal satiety signaling as well as dysfunctional neural processing of food
      cues are discussed as possible casual factors in the development and maintenance of this
      disorder. Additional research is needed to specify the exact contribution of these
      observations and how they interact with each other. Accordingly, the current study plans to
      investigate metabolic gut-brain signaling to better understand the underlying causes of
      abnormal eating behavior. To this end, 25 healthy normal weight control participants as well
      as 25 patients with BED will be recruited. The responsivity of the hypothalamus (i.e., the
      core region of homeostatic control) and its interaction with the mesocorticolimbic reward
      system will be assessed by applying a single-blind, randomized, crossover design of
      intravenous infusion of glucose or NaCl. This approach allows the study of gut-brain
      signaling to the hypothalamus and the reward system by controlling for sensory aspects of
      food intake (sight, smell, and taste). The interaction between the hypothalamus and the
      mesocorticolimbic reward system will be investigated using an effective connectivity
      analysis. FMRI with high spatial resolution and with an optimized protocol for the
      investigation of the hypothalamus and the mesocorticolimbic reward system will be employed. A
      better understanding of the underlying psychobiological mechanisms of BED is a fundamental
      requirement for the development of improved prevention and treatment strategies

        The study will enroll 25 patients with BED. Patients will be recruited from the
        investigator's in- and out-patient department or by public advertisement after giving their
        written informed consent. Additionally, a healthy control group of 25 participants will be
        recruited by public advertisement.
