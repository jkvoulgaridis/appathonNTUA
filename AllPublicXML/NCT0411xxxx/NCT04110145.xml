             sensation not described as pain) or pain associated with 2 or more of the following at
             least 25% of the time:

               1. Improvement with defecation

               2. Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool

               3. Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool

             (lower GI bleeding [rectal bleeding or heme-positive stool], iron-deficiency anemia,

          -  Participant has had surgery that meets any of the following criteria:

               1. Surgery to remove a segment of the GI tract at any time before Screening (Visit
                  1)

               4. Other major surgery during the 30 days before Screening (Visit 1)

          -  Participant has a mechanical bowel obstruction or pseudo-obstruction.

             components or other medications in the same drug class

          -  Participant has any of the following conditions:

               1. Celiac disease, or positive serological test for celiac disease or the condition

               2. Cystic fibrosis

               3. Hypothyroidism that is untreated or treated with thyroid hormone at a dose that
                  has not been stable for at least 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1)

                  or on toilet paper and/or pain/crying with bowel movement within 2 weeks prior to
                  Screening). (Note: Anal fissures that have resolved at least 2 weeks prior to
                  screening would not be exclusionary.) However, if in the investigator's opinion,
                  an anal fissure(s) may be the primary cause of participant's modified Rome III FC
                  criteria, the participant would not be eligible to participate in the study.

               6. Anatomic malformations (eg, imperforate anus, anal stenosis, anterior displaced

               8. Neuropathic conditions (eg, spinal cord abnormalities, neurofibromatosis,
                  tethered cord, spinal cord trauma)

               9. Lead toxicity, hypercalcemia

              10. Neurodevelopmental disabilities (early-onset, chronic disorders that share the
                  essential feature of a predominant disturbance in the acquisition of cognitive,
                  motor, language, or social skills, which has a significant and continuing impact
                  on the developmental progress of an individual) producing a cognitive delay that
                  precludes comprehension and completion of the daily eDiary or other study-related
                  questionnaires (Note: Participants are excluded if the person who will be
                  completing the daily eDiary or other study-related questionnaires meets this
                  criterion.)

              11. Inflammatory bowel disease

              12. Childhood functional abdominal pain syndrome

              13. Childhood functional abdominal pain

              14. Poorly treated or poorly controlled psychiatric disorders that might influence
                  his or her ability to participate in the study

              15. Lactose intolerance that is associated with symptoms which could confound the
                  assessments in this study

              16. History of cancer other than treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin. (Note:

        Participants with a history of cancer are allowed provided that the malignancy has been in
        a complete remission before the Randomization Visit. A complete remission is defined as the
        disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment.)

          -  Participant received a study intervention during the 30 days before Screening (Visit
             1) or is planning to receive study intervention (other than that administered during
             this study)

          -  Participant's parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver has been directly or indirectly
             involved in the conduct and administration of this study as an investigator, study
             coordinator, or other study staff member. In addition, any participant,
             parent/guardian/LAR or caregiver who has a first-degree family member, significant
             other, or relative residing with him/her directly or indirectly who is involved in
             this study

          -  For participants aged ≥ 4 years old: Participant has a history of non-retentive fecal
             incontinence
