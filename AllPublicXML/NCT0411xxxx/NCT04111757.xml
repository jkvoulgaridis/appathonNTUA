  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect safety and effectiveness data for the
      Technolas Teneo 317 Model 2 excimer laser for LASIK correction in participants with myopia
      and myopic astigmatism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Technolas TENEO 317 Model 2 excimer laser is a scanning excimer laser that operates at 193 nm
      ultraviolet wavelength to photoablate corneal tissue in order to achieve a refractive change.
      It is planned to enroll and treat up to 334 participant eyes, with an expectation that 300
      study eyes will complete post-surgical follow-up for 6 months or until the point of achieved
      refractive stability. When a cohort of at least 300 eyes has achieved refractive stability at
      6 months post-surgery, all other treated eyes that have not reached the 6-month examination
      may be discontinued at the Sponsor's request. Or, if 300 eyes achieve refractive stability at
      9 months post-surgery, all other treated eyes that have not reached the 9-month examination
      may be discontinued

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are 22 years of age or older.

          -  Have read, understood, and signed an informed consent form (ICF).

          -  Have demonstrated stable refraction (for example, a change of ≤0.5 D in sphere and
             cylinder) for a minimum of 12 months prior to surgery, verified by consecutive
             refractions and/or medical records or prescription history.

          -  Have myopic refractive error with or without astigmatism; sphere between -1.0 D and
             -10.00 D, cylinder between 0.0 D and -3.0 D; with a manifest refraction spherical
             equivalent (MRSE) between -1.0 D and -11.50 D.

          -  Have uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 20/40 or worse.

          -  Have manifest distance best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/25
             (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] 0.1) or better in an operative
             eye.

          -  Have equal to or less than 0.50 D spherical equivalent (SE) difference between
             cycloplegic and manifest refractions at Visit 1 (pre-operative).

          -  Have normal corneal topography as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Have discontinued use of contact lenses for at least 2 weeks (for hard or toric
             lenses) or 3 days (for soft contact lenses) prior to the pre-operative examination,
             and through the day of surgery.

          -  All contact lens wearers must demonstrate a stable refraction (within ±0.5 D), as
             determined by MRSE, on 2 consecutive examinations at least 1 week apart, in an eye to
             be treated and the axis of cylinder should not differ by more than 15 degrees from the
             baseline cycloplegic refraction.

          -  Have the ability to lie flat without difficulty.

          -  Are willing and able to comply with the schedule for all post-surgery follow-up
             visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the
             planned operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in treatment depth
             less than 250 microns from corneal endothelium.

          -  Eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a difference
             greater than 0.50 D in sphere power, or a difference greater than 0.50 D in cylinder
             power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees compared to the
             baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of less than 0.50 D,
             the difference in cylinder axis will not be taken into consideration.

          -  Participants for whom the pre-operative assessment of the cornea indicates that one or
             both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the Investigator's
             medical judgment.

          -  Have evidence of retinal vascular disease.

          -  Have a history of or have active corneal disease or infection (for example, recurrent
             corneal erosion syndrome, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster keratitis) in either eye.

          -  Have a known sensitivity to any study medication.

          -  Have central corneal scars affecting visual acuity or unstable keratometry with
             irregular mires in an eye considered for eligibility.

          -  Have keratoconus, subclinical or forme fruste keratoconus, corneal dystrophy, or other
             corneal irregularity (for example, irregular astigmatism).

          -  Have visually significant or progressive cataract in an eye considered for
             eligibility.

          -  Had previous intraocular or corneal surgery in an eye considered for eligibility that
             might confound the outcome of the study or increase the risk to the participant.

          -  Use chronic medications by any administration route that may increase risk to the
             participant or may confound the outcome of the study, including those known to affect
             wound healing (for example, corticosteroids, antimetabolites).

          -  Are known to have acute or chronic disease or illness (for example, dry eye, cataract,
             glaucoma, immuno-compromised, rheumatoid arthritis, clinically significant atopic
             disease, acne rosacea) that would increase operative risk or may confound the results
             of the study.

          -  Are taking medications contraindicated for LASIK such as isotretinoin (Accutane) or
             amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone).

             disease.

          -  Are participating in any other ophthalmic clinical trial within 30 days of screening
             or during this clinical trial.

          -  Have an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other disorder
             affecting fixation.
