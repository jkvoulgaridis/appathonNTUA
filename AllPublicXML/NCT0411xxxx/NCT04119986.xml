  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1970, the first percutaneous balloon coronary angioplasty opened a new chapter of
      interventional therapy. However, the incidence of intracoronary restenosis was about 30%.
      Subsequently, bare metal stents and drug-eluting stents (DES) reduced the incidence of
      in-stent restenosis (ISR) to 5%-10% and it was still a bottleneck treated by percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI). Currently, ISR is mainly treated by balloon angioplasty, stent
      implantation and coronary artery bypass grafting.

      In 2014, the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology recommended that drug balloon
      therapy (DCB) and new generation DES should be the preferred strategies for ISR treatment.
      Compared with DES, DCB treatment can avoid the inflammation of intima caused by multi-layer
      stent strut, and reduce the risk of intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis in stent. However, DCB
      lacks sustained radial support. Even if the residual stenosis is less than 30% after
      sufficient pre-dilation, the elastic retraction of the intima still exists. In addition, the
      antiproliferative effect of paclitaxel is significantly worse than that of sirolimus and its
      derivatives, and there is a lack of long-term sustained release of anti-proliferative drugs.
      Compared with DCB, DES can obtain long-term stable radial support and long-term
      anti-proliferation effect, but stent struts exposed in the vascular lumen are at risk of
      stent thrombosis. The new generation of DES improves the design of stent platform, improves
      the polymer coating, and applies new anti-proliferative drugs. It effectively reduces the
      inflammation of vascular wall, speeds up the process of vascular re-endothelialization,
      promotes early vascular repair, and significantly reduces the incidence of stent thrombosis.
      Recent BIOLUXRCT, RESTORE and DARE studies provide more powerful evidence for the treatment
      of ISR by new generation DES.

      Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is the second generation FFR detectional method based on
      coronary contrast image. The latest FAVOR II results also confirm that QFR is more sensitive
      and specific than quantitative coronary analysis (QCA) in the diagnosis of myocardial
      ischemia caused by coronary artery stenosis. However, there is no report of ISR treated with
      DCB under the guidance of QFR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of DCB in the treatment of in-stent restenosis in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD)
      under the guidance of QFR compared with DES implantation.

      The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug balloon therapy for ISR in patients with CHD under
      the guidance of QFR compared with DES implantation. Based on previous study reported, the
      incidence rate of target lesion failure is about 3% in patients with ISR undergoing DES
      implantation. And the design of non-inferiority study was performed in our study. Moreover,
      the investigators estimated 10% loss follow-up of these patients in each arm. As a result, a
      total of 220 patients with ISR were required, and with 110 patients per group as a ratio of
      1:1 randomization.
