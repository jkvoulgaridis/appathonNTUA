    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal artery ligation with Doppler guidance (HAL) and suture fixation of hemorrhoidal
      nodes (RAR) is a popular minimally invasive technique for hemorrhoidal disease (HD) treatment
      which uses an ultrasound probe to detect hemorrhoidal arteries for further ligation. We
      hypothesized that ultrasound guidance has no advantages over manual hemorrhoidal arteries
      detection for HD treatment.

      The aim is to compare the results of HAL-RAR procedure in patients with stage II-III HD with
      Doppler and manual HA detection.

      In this ongoing randomized, controlled, single center clinical study 200 patients randomly
      divided into group A (HAL-RAR with Doppler US navigation) and group B (HAL with manual HA
      detection and mucopexy) are planned to be included. The primary endpoint was recurrence of
      any symptoms of HD; secondary endpoints were pain syndrome severity (VAS), treatment
      satisfaction (1 to 5 points) and need for the drug therapy in 30 days and 8 weeks after
      surgery.

      Ultrasound guidance technology of HAL with mucopexy could have the same efficacy the manual
      HA detection regarding the HD treatment effectiveness and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease (HD), in its different manifestations, is not only the most frequented
      grounds of referring for medical attention, but also one of the reasons for the modest
      deterioration in the quality of life that can possibly result in temporary or permanent
      reduction of work capacities. Today, the doppler-guided dearterialization of hemorrhoidal
      arteries and the following suture-fixation mucopexy in the anal canal (synonyms: mucopexy,
      hemorrhoids lifting, HAL-RAR) is one of the most popular and actively studied methods of the
      stage II - III hemorrhoidal disease surgical treatment. A number of publications raise an
      issue whether it is really necessary to use a doppler while the localization of the
      hemorrhoidal arteries is typical in the vast majority of the observations and can be easily
      determined on palpation.

      The aim of the study is to compare the direct and long-term results of the II - III grade HD
      surgical treatment with the use of two techniques of the suture ligation of the hemorrhoidal
      arteries with mucopexy. One of these methods is classic and widely known HAL-RAR, the other
      one has a principal differ in no-using the doppler to find the arteries, the surgeon defines
      them on palpation.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the digital detection of hemorrhoidal arteries pulsation
      followed by suture ligation and mucopexy may be no less effective in the treatment of grade
      II - III hemorrhoids than the use of a doppler guide.

    <description>Ligation: a lubricating gel is applied to the tip of the Transanal Hemorrhoidal Dearterialization device and, with the patient in the lithotomy position, the proctoscope is introduced into the anal canal. The terminal branches of the superior rectal artery are detected by the doppler signal 2-3 cm above the dentate line. The tip of the instrument is gently tilted and the arteries are ligated with a Z-shaped stitch using 2:0 braided polyglycolic acid suture inserted using a special needle-holder through an aperture in the operating proctoscope.
Mucopexy: after the haemorrhoid artery ligation, the suture is continued with three to five sutures applied 5 mm apart, making sure that the last is at least 5 mm above the dentate line. The suture is then tied to create a hemorrhoidopexy. The procedure is repeated after all detected artery ligations.</description>
