  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard post-operative radiographic protocol for the monitoring of fractures at Health
      Sciences Centre includes post-operative in hospital radiographs as well as radiographs at the
      two week follow up appointment. This is in addition to good quality intra-operative
      radiographs. With current operative techniques and implants, orthopaedic surgeons can achieve
      reliably stable internal fixation. In fact, patients are often allowed to take weight through
      the fractured limb immediately post-operatively. In these cases, redundant post-operative
      radiographs likely represent an avoidable cost to the system financially, and an avoidable
      cost to the patient in additional time spent in hospital and unnecessary radiation exposure.

    <description>A validated 17 question survey tool is used with each question in a 10 centimeter visual analog scale format. Examples of scale ranges (0-10) are provided. The following is a list of some questions asked of participants:
Staff don't seem to listen to anything I tell them during my consultation.
Agree Disagree
I feel that I'm in good hands when I come to the clinic.
Agree Disagree
I'm always given a clear explanation of why I am having tests done.
Agree Disagree
There are some things about my care in the clinic which could be improved.
Agree Disagree
