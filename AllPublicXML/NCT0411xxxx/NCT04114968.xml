  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect and feasibility of expanding the target population in the
      Danish cervical cancer screening program to include women aged 65 to 69 years. The study also
      evaluates if HPV self-sampling constitutes an appropriate screening method among older women.

      The study is a nationwide population-based prospective cohort study embedded in the routine
      cervical cancer screening program in the Central Denmark Region. The study includes all 65 to
      69 years old Danish women with no record of a cervical cytology sample or screening
      invitation within the last five years. Furthermore, the women are not registered as
      ineligible for screening, eg due hysterectomy. Eligible women residing in the Central Denmark
      Region are allocated to the intervention group (n=20,000), while women residing in the other
      four Danish regions are allocated to the control group receiving standard care (n=71,500),
      which for this group is low-level opportunistic screening at the general practitioner (GP).
      The intervention group are invited for HPV-based screening by the GP or to request a
      self-sampling kit.

    <description>Eligible women residing in the Central Denmark Region will be assigned to intervention group. Women in the intervention group receive an invitation for HPV-based cervical cancer screening by attending either 1) GP-based screening or 2) HPV self-sampling. The self-sampling kit includes the dry Evalyn brush self-sampling device (Rovers Medical Devices B.V, Oss, Netherlands), written and picture-based user instructions on how to collect and mail the self-sample, and a prestamped return envelope addressed to the Department of Pathology, Randers Regional Hospital.</description>

    <description>Eligible women residing in the other five Danish regions (North, Central, South, Zealand and Capital ) will be assigned to control group. Women in the control group will receive usual care, which for 65-69 year-old women is opportunistic cervical cancer screening at the GP</description>
