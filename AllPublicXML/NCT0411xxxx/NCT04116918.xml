      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Anlotinb and
      JS001 in EGFR-TKI resistant T790M-negative NSCLC patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All EGFR mutation NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKIs eventually develop acquired resistance and in
      40%-50% of these the resistance mechanism is based on the EGFR T790M mutation who could
      receive Osimertinib. Several alternative mechanisms of escape from EGFR-TKIs have been
      detected in NSCLC patients without the T790M, such as Met application, BRAF mutation, PIK3CA
      mutation, etc, who could receive the combination of EGFR-TKI with comparable target drug.
      Given the lack of targeted therapy for the majority of T790M-negative patients,
      platinum-doublet chemotherapy remains the standard of care with low effectiveness. In the
      present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Anlotinb
      and JS001 in EGFR-TKI resistant T790M-negative NSCLC patients.
