  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, investigator initiated study that aims to explore the feasibility of
      using a personalized 3D printed immobilization mask for CNS patients undergoing radiation
      therapy.

      For the purpose of this study, patients will undergo the standard CT SIM, and MR SIM
      necessary for radiation therapy, creating the masks from the MRIs. Prior to the start of
      their treatment, patients will have an additional CT scan with the 3D printed mask to confirm
      safety and treatment accuracy. Patients will then proceed with their standard radiation
      therapy, immobilized with the mask. There will be a control group that will be treated with
      the standard thermoplastic mask, as a comparison measure. Both groups will complete a mask
      tolerability questionnaire throughout the course of their treatment to capture the level of
      discomfort patients may feel with either masks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients referred for radiotherapy have had a previous diagnostic imaging study (CT-scan
      or more commonly MRI) showing the disease at the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover,
      after surgical biopsy or resection, many Centers perform repeated post-operative imaging.
      Despite all prior imaging, when radiotherapy treatment is decided, all patients undergo
      another imaging study (CT simulation [CT-sim]) in which patient's head is placed in a
      reproducible position, and endure a moulding procedure to create a personalized plastic mask
      for securing the patient's head in a fixed position during the CT acquisition, and reproduced
      at the subsequent radiation treatment sessions. Typical wait times between moulding, CT-sim
      and the first radiation treatment is 3-7 days. If a method would be available to accurately
      recreate the patient's position during diagnostic imaging and reproduce it during radiation
      treatments without the need for a moulding session or CT-sim, the treatment process can be
      streamlined and wait times shortened for patients.

      Previous studies using 3D printing technology in radiotherapy (such as brachytherapy
      applicators) have shown that these employed materials are safe for use in clinical settings,
      and 3D printers can accurately produce devices of various shapes and sizes for clinical use.

      In this study, we propose a novel workflow in which patient's position at diagnostic imaging
      is reproduced with a 3D-printed patient-specific immobilization device, enabling the use of
      the same diagnostic imaging for planning purposes in lieu of dedicated simulation and
      moulding sessions, to decrease wait times for patients between diagnostic imaging and start
      of radiation treatment.
