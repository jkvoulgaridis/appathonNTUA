      The Investigator proposes to record the fetal and postnatal development of children conceived
      using Mitochondrial Donation (MD) and to perform expert assessment of development at 18
      months (corrected for gestational age) using the internationally validated Bayley-III
      developmental assessment tool.

      To record the fetal and postnatal development of children conceived using Mitochondrial
      Donation and to perform internationally validated Bayley-III developmental assessment tool at
      18 months (corrected for gestational age).

      The null hypothesis for this research is that children born following the use of
      Mitochondrial Donation (IVF) techniques have normal neurodevelopment developmental outcomes
      at 18 months.
