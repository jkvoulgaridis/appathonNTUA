      Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced melanoma, renal cell
      carcinoma, NSCLC, HCC (Child Pugh Class A only), MSI-High solid tumors, Urothelial Cancer, GE
      junction/Gastric Adenocarcinoma, or HNSCC for which current standard of care treatment for
      their stage of disease would be with Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab monotherapy, who meet
      eligibility criteria will undergo a biopsy (core or excisional/incisional; FNA not adequate)
      for baseline tissue. Patients will then be randomized to one of 3 arms: Anti-PD-1 mAb plus
      Metformin 500mg po BID, Anti-PD-1 mAb alone, Anti-PD-1 mAb plus Rosiglitazone 4mg po qdaily.
      Five weeks (+/- 7 days) after initiation of therapy a patient will undergo a repeat biopsy
      (core or excisional/incisional; FNA not adequate) for correlative analysis. The patient will
      then continue on study therapy for up to 2 years, or until progression of disease or
      unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. RECIST 1.1 with modifications, to allow for
      continued therapy until progressive disease is confirmed if the patient is clinically stable,
      will be used in the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for patients with metastatic disease remains poor. The use of immunotherapy in
      the treatment of cancer is based on the premise that tumors evade the endogenous immune
      response by being recognized as self, and not non-self. The recent success of
      immune-modulating agents in patients with refractory solid tumors has provided
      proof-of-concept of the efficacy of immune system activation as a therapeutic modality.
      Tumors develop immune resistance using different mechanisms; the goal of immunotherapy is to
      counteract these resistance mechanisms, allowing the endogenous immune system to reject
      tumors. One of those mechanisms of resistance is tumor hypoxia

      This study aims to examine whether Metformin and Rosiglitazone will reduce tumor oxygen
      consumption, creating a less hypoxic T cell environment, with pharmacologic remodeling of the
      TME leading to restored anti-tumor T cell effector function and as a result will act
      synergistically with anti-PD-1 mAb resulting in a higher response rate than with anti-PD-1
      mAb alone. The safety and tolerability of if adding metformin or rosiglitazone to anti-PD-1
      mAb therapy will assessed.

      Eligible patients will undergo pre-treatment biopsy and then will be randomized to one of
      three arms: 1. Anti-PD-1 mAb + Metformin 500mg PO BID 2. Anti-PD-1 mAb alone or 3. Anti-PD-1
      mAb plus Rosiglitazone 4mg po qdaily. Patients will undergo post treatment biopsy after 5
      weeks (+/- 7 days) of treatment and then continue treatment for up to 2 years, or until
      progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.
