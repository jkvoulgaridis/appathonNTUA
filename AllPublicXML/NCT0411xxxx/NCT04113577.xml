      This study evaluates the usability of a new tablet PC application to stimulate cognitive
      functions. Patients hospitalized in a geriatric ward (day or complete hospitalisation) but
      also their informal and professional caregivers will assess the usability of the application
      using a structured survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention span is one of the most frequently and early impaired cognitive functions during
      aging, especially in neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Decline of
      attention span can lead to a cognitive complaint by the patient or his or her relatives, even
      in the prodromal phase of the disease (DSM V: minor neurocognitive disorder). The current
      challenge is to develop strategies to prevent the cognitive decline in patients with minor
      neurocognitive disorder or major cognitive disorder with slight impairment, and thus to limit
      cognitive decline. However, to date, no strategy has shown clear effectiveness in preventing
      cognitive decline in patients with neurocognitive disorder.

      Interestingly, the integration of perceptual skills are modified in patients with
      neurocognitive disorders, and in particular visuomotor skills (from early stages).
      Measurements of evoked potientials during visual stimulation in patients with minor
      neurocognitive disorder have shown a preservation of sensory responses but a decrease in
      cognitive responses. Based on this observation, a US team had recently tested the
      effectiveness of computer-based visual cognitive exercises performed regularly for 8 weeks in
      patients free of major neurocognitive disorder. They had reported an improvement in
      information processing speed and walking performance. These results suggest that regular
      cognitive stimulation exercises using tablet PC visual exercices could improve attention span
      and in particular the information processing speed in patient with minor or early major
      neurocognitive disorder.

      In particular, Cogilus, a cross-platform tablet PC application (Android, iOS, Microsoft) has
      recently been developed for this purpose. The Cogilus project, is designed for health
      professionals who support patients with neurological syndromes including cognitive or
      attentional dysfunctions. The application is also open to carers and family members, who will
      be able to support the patient in using the application (based on the exercices proposed by
      professionals).

      The finale objective of the Cogilus project is to assess the impact of the regular use of
      Cogilus on patient with minor or early major neurocognitive disorder. Considering the
      specific needs in usability for this population, the first step to devoloppe such technology
      is to assess the usability of the application in patients but also in unformal and
      professional cargivers.

    <measure>Usability regarding the Cogilus app</measure>
    <time_frame>after 30 minutes of test of the app</time_frame>
    <description>Average of the usability scores. Usability score is calculated using the responses to the validated System Usability Scale (SUS). SUS is composed of 10 questions. Each response is ranking from 0 to 5. The total score ranges between 0 and 100. It is calculted considering the sum of the result on each question multiplicated by 2. An average score equal or over 70/100 will be considered as satisfying.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction regarding the Cogilus app</measure>
    <time_frame>after 30 minutes of test of the app</time_frame>
    <description>Average recommendation score. Satisfaction score is calculated using the responses to the recommendation scale. This scale is a ten point's scale from 0 (I don't recommend at all) to 10 (I fully recommend). An average score greater than 5/10 would be acceptable, a score greater than or equal to 7/10 would be satisfactory.</description>

    <measure>Global ergonomics regarding the Cogilus app</measure>
    <time_frame>after 30 minutes of test of the app</time_frame>
    <description>Average ergonomics score: The ergonomics score is a composite score based on the average of the answers to four ergonomics questions on a four-level Likert scale. The Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The average score is reported on ten. An average score greater than 5/10 would be acceptable, a score greater than or equal to 7/10 would be satisfactory.</description>
