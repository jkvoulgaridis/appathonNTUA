  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to evaluate whether mandibular advancement device (MAD) is
      non-inferior to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the treatment of obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) and blood pressure reduction. OSA and hypertension are highly prevalent
      disorders with profound impacts on health. Apart from improving quality of-life, an effective
      OSA treatment could improve cardiovascular risk partly through blood pressure reduction,
      particularly in patients with high cardiovascular risk in whom blood pressure control is
      often suboptimal. Although CPAP is useful, the high non-acceptance and non-adherence preclude
      its widespread use.

      East Asians have a restrictive craniofacial phenotype that predisposes them to OSA and the
      associated cardiovascular stress. CPAP, while considered the first-line therapy for OSA, has
      failed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in randomized trials till date because it is poorly
      tolerated. MADs are oral appliances that correct the restrictive craniofacial phenotype
      present in East Asians by protruding the lower jaw to reduce upper airway collapsibility.
      MADs are better tolerated than CPAP, and this may be an important determinant of the overall
      effectiveness in treating OSA, and thus ameliorating the downstream adverse health outcomes.
      We hypothesize that MADs are non-inferior to CPAP in treating OSA and reducing cardiovascular
      risk by blood pressure reduction in East Asians.

      We will recruit East Asian subjects with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk for
      polysomnography. Patients diagnosed with OSA (n=220) will be randomized to MAD or CPAP groups
      in a 1:1 ratio for a treatment duration of 6 months. The primary endpoint is the 24-hour mean
      blood pressure as determined by ambulatory monitoring. The secondary endpoints include
      sleep-time systolic BP, target blood pressure, cardiovascular biomarkers, and myocardial
      remodeling. Association between OSA and silent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will also be
      determined. If MADs are shown to be effective, the next step is to evaluate our novel device-
      drug-eluting MAD that the team is developing.

    <description>Mandibular advancement device (MAD) has been a novel method in the management of snoring and OSA. For mild to moderate sleep apnea, MADs have been a boon. A guideline published by American Academy of Sleep Medicine stated that MAD was indicated as first-line therapy for mild OSA and a second-line therapy for moderate to severe OSA</description>
