    <textblock>
      Precocious puberty and childhood overweight and obesity are important public health problems
      that both had adverse effects, which including psychological symptom in childhood, short
      final height or reproductive dysfunction in adulthood, on children's physical and
      psychological development.The prevalence of precocious puberty and childhood overweight and
      obesity are both high, and a growing body of epidemiological studies suggested that there was
      a close relationship of childhood overweight and obesity with puberty development, especially
      in girls. However, the underlying mechanism between them is unclear. Existing evidence shows
      that the occurrence of precocious puberty and overweight and obesity are the result of
      interaction of multiple factors, which consists growth environment and genetics, and many
      previous studies provided that more overlapping genes existed between obesity and precocious
      puberty patients, suggesting that common genes may result in these diseases. Therefore, based
      on a case control study, which will investigate the associations between obesity pleiotropic
      genes and early puberty, the researchers will collect information related to obesity, growth
      environment factors and risk genes in this study to evaluate the relationships of these
      related factors and precocious puberty, and to further explore whether there exists
      biological interaction effects of these risk factors on sexual precocity. This project has
      been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Children's Medical Center.

      1. Purpose: A prospective cohort study. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect
           of pediatric weight status and childhood growth environment on puberty development.

        2. Participants: Participants are primary school children aged 6- to 12-year-old, and their
           parents must be willing to engage in this study and comply with study requirements.

        3. Study Procedure: According to geographic and population distribution, about 40 schools
           included in this study by stratified, random clustering sampling in three cities of
           China, including Qufu, Zhongshan and Huhhot. Participant will accept anthropometric
           measuring by clinicians from the three collaborated hospitals, including BoAi Hospital
           of Zhongshan, QuFu People' s Hospital and Inner Mongolia People's Hospital. This study
           will be conducted among children of grade 1 to 3 from selected schools in 2019 and the
           first, secondary and third follow-up will be conducted one, two and three year later
           respectively.

        4. Exposures: Participants with overweight or obesity will be included in overweight and
           obesity group at baseline.

        5. Related risk factors: Childhood growth and family environmental information, including
           physical activity, diet habit, sleep duration, family structure and family
           social-economic status, will be collected by parent-reported questionnaire;

        6. Outcomes measures: Participants' puberty stage will be evaluated by secondary sexual
           characteristics development by physician palpation.

    <description>All subjects will accept physician palpation to assess their puberty development stage according to Tanner staging method: Testicular volume will be measure by palpation and a Prader testicular meter and be graded to 1 (&lt; 4 ml) to 5 (&gt; 20 ml) in boys. Breast development will be graded to 1(pre-adolescent) to 5 (fully mature) in girls. Pubic hair development will be graded to 1(pre-adolescent) to 5 (fully mature) in both boys and girls. Precocious puberty will be defined as the onset age of breast development (B2) or pubic hair development (PH2) before 8 years or menarche before 10 years in girls and of PH2 or testicular enlargement (T2) before 9 years in boys. For girls with overweight or obesity, breast ultrasound will be used to discriminate glandular breast and fat tissue.</description>

Early puberty will be defined as children reached a certain puberty stage earlier than the median age of that stage. According to a large Chinese population-based study, the median ages for pubertal stages will be referenced. Moreover, the presence of menarche before 12 years in girls and of voice breaking before 13 years in boys will also be categorized as early puberty.</description>

    <description>To divide participants into overweight and obesity and non-overweight group according to their weight status, height (H), weight (W) and waist circumference (WC) will be measured with a uniform tool, which has been calibrated. When measuring the height, the subjects are required to take off their shoes and stand in an upright position. To measuring weight, the subjects are required to wear close-fitting clothes and bare feet. Subjects are required to take the standing position to measure waist circumference horizontally at the mid-point of line between the lower margin of the ribs and the upper margin of the ilium. All those data will be kept one decimal place. Anthropometric measuring will be taken at baseline and follow-up periods.</description>
