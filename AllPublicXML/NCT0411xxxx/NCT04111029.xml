  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carrying tumor-specific sequence alterations has been found in
      the cell-free fraction of blood. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens are difficult to
      obtain, and noninvasive methods are required to assess cancer progression and characterize
      underlying genomic features. Use of 'liquid biopsy' by assessing circulating cell free DNA
      enables the clinician to offer targeted immunotherapy or signaling pathway inhibitors. It
      also offers a model to prove response to locoregional or immunotherapy therapy and predict
      tumor recurrence non-invasively.

      Novelty:

      Mutation analysis may not only help identify cancer drivers, but they can also provide useful
      data to predict response to other treatment modalities such as immunotherapies, particularly
      immune checkpoint blockade. There is published data on liquid biopsy in India from oncology
      in the field of pulmonary and renal cancers, but these studies have not been done in
      cirrhosis or in HCC patients.

      Objectives In this project we hope to develop a biomarker panel which helps us prognosticate
      patients and tailor targeted therapy as per their genetic mutation landscape. The treatment
      options for advanced HCC are limited, and tissue biopsy is not routinely performed.

      Methods In this pilot project, we will analyze 30 patients with unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma, ineligible for liver transplantation, who will undergo locoregional therapy in the
      form of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radioembolization (TARE) for tissue
      diagnosis of tumor tissue DNA and circulating tumor DNA. We will design personalized assays
      targeting somatic rearrangements of each tumor to quantify serum ctDNA. Exome sequencing will
      be performed using cell-free DNA and paired primary tumor tissue DNA in order to create a
      non-invasive liquid biopsy for diagnosis and prognostication of HCC.
