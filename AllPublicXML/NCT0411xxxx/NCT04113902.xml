      Aim: To determine the effects of health education about Human Papilloma Virus infection and
      cervical cancer prevention on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of adolescent girls
      and their mothers.

      Background: To combat with cervical cancer, it is urgent that prevention Human Papilloma
      Virus related disease all around the world.

      Design: A randomized trial with a control group (n=108) and an intervention group (n=108).

      Methods: The study was applied between January to June 2019 in the two different adolescent
      outpatient clinics in Turkey. The outpatient clinics were randomly assigned as intervention
      and control groups by numbering and opaque and sealed envelopes. Based on the
      intention-to-treat principle, all participants were analyzed according to the group they were
      assigned to, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not. In addition to the
      routine clinical practice, the adolescent girls and their mothers who participated in the
      intervention group were given health education twice in the first interview and in the fifth
      week. Follow-up continued for 12 weeks. The adolescent girls and their mothers in the control
      group received routine clinical practice. The effects of health education were evaluated with
      Human Papilloma Virus Knowledge Scale and Health Belief Model Scale for Human Papilloma Virus
      and its Vaccination.

      Impact: Human Papilloma Virus vaccine, which has an important place in primary protection
      from cervical cancer, is expected to provide effective results by facilitating access to
      vaccine accompanied with health education.
