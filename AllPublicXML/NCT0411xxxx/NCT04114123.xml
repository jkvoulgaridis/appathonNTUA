  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the researchers want to learn more about reward-driven eating behavior in
      children ages 2 to 24 months. The researchers hope to use this knowledge to help inform
      obesity prevention programs.

    <ipd_description>The research will generate demographic, anthropometric, dietary, behavioral questionnaire, and coded behavioral data. (Note the researchers will not make video data available.) The data will be stored as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) or Statistical Analysis System (SAS) files. Meta data will also be included in the selected repositories.The meta data will include the data dictionaries, which describe the generation of all variables, as well as the protocol manuals describing the behavioral protocols used to generate the variables.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data submitted to Deep Blue Data will be reviewed after 10 years to determine if a dataset should be retained and will be subject to further, periodic, reviews thereafter.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>All data in the Deep Blue Data repository are available to anyone for download without restriction.</ipd_access_criteria>
