  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human intestinal tract harbors a diverse and complex microbial community, known as gut
      microbiota, which is critical in sustaining physiology, metabolism, nutrition and immune
      function. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been linked with obesity, hyperglycemia,
      hyperlipidemia, inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Gut
      microbiota is affected by host genetic markup, diet and life style; and therefore varied by
      human races and geographical locations.

      The development of gut microbiota starts before birth. The infant's microbiome can impact on
      human health in later life. The microbiome of pregnant women are associated with early-life
      microbiota of their offspring as well as growth, neurodevelopment and the development of
      allergic and neurocognitive disorders.

      Early childhood, when the microbiota is less mature and more malleable, is a golden age for
      microbiota manipulation to prevent disease. Studying microbiota at this golden age also allow
      us to dissect the development of a faulty microbiota and identify therapeutic targets to
      reverse it and cure diseases that are already developed.

        This project will consist of a total 100,000 mother-baby pairs from all centers in 7 years.
        The study is exploratory in nature. In considering the number of events required for
        reliable quantification of different factors on a range of diseases, we decided to include
        100,000 mother-baby pairs.
