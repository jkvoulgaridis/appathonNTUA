      LCZ696, a molecular complex of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan with an
      inhibitor of neprilysin (NEP, neutral endopeptidase-24.11) sacubitril improved mortality
      compared to enalapril in patients with heart failure (HF), reduced ejection fraction (EF),
      and increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) in the
      PARADIGM-HF trial.1 The PIONEER-HF study demonstrated the efficacy of LCZ696 in preventing
      rehospitalization in patients with acutely decompensated HF.2

      LCZ696 has been underutilized in heart failure, in part due to concerns about hypotension.
      NEP degrades several vasodilator peptides including bradykinin, substance P and brain-type
      natriuretic peptide. Decreased degradation of endogenous bradykinin could contribute to
      hypotension at initiation of LCZ696 through vasodilation or through increased natriuresis and
      diuresis. Inhibition of the bradykinin B2 receptor using icatibant would be expected to
      prevent this effect.

      Objectives

      The main objectives of this mechanistic randomized, double-blind, crossover-design study are:

        -  The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that endogenous bradykinin contributes
           to effects of ARB/NEP inhibition on blood pressure, natriuresis, and diuresis at
           initiation.

        -  The secondary objective is to test the hypothesis endogenous bradykinin contributes to
           effects of ARB/NEP inhibition on blood pressure, natriuresis, and diuresis after
           up-titration.

      Eighty (80) subjects with stable heart failure who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will
      be enrolled. Subjects who qualify will collect their urine for 24 hours before each study day
      for measurement of volume, sodium and potassium. At the start of the study, they will stop
      their regular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or ARB. After a 48-hour washout,
      they will undergo a study day in which they are given a single dose of 50 mg LCZ696. They
      will also receive either the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant or placebo vehicle
      in random order (double-blind). After a 96-hour washout, they will repeat the study day and
      receive a single dose of 50 mg LCZ696 and the opposite study drug (icatibant or placebo).
      After completion of the two acute study days, subjects will take LCZ696 50 mg bid for two
      weeks, followed by LCZ696 100 mg bid for three weeks, and then LCZ696 200 mg bid, following
      the conservative up-titration protocol from the TITRATION study.3 Criteria for continuing
      up-titration appear in the full study protocol. On the 7th and 10th day of the 200 mg bid or
      highest tolerated dose, subjects will again undergo two more study days three days apart in
      which they are randomized to receive either icatibant or vehicle.
