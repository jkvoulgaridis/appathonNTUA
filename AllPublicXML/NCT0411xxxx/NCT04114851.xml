    <textblock>
      There are different types of pain generators that give different pain symptoms. In anesthesia
      and surgery, the pain generator in connection with, for example, surgical procedures is
      referred to as nociceptive pain. However, there is not enough evidence to support that these
      physiological changes are direct signs of nociceptive stimulation. The same changes can be
      seen with an autonomous stress trigger of origin other than just nociceptive stimulation.
      This means that healthcare professionals who provide anesthesia to patients during, for
      example, surgery may provide unnecessary pain relief drugs or do not provide pain relief when
      needed. This is also true in awake patients when pain is complex that, for example, concerns
      may increase the experience of pain and that healthcare professionals may even then
      misinterpret and provide more pain-relieving drugs despite the actual need for another drug
      or complementary treatment.

      Examples of these include heart rate variation, specific patterns in blood pressure and heart
      rate response, heart rate amplitude, heart rate range, skin sweating and pupil response. The
      reason why these changes have not been used to interpret nociceptive stimulation is directly
      linked to an absence of technology that makes it possible to collect data and interpret these
      changes.

      list a number of methods / techniques that are under development, one of which is the
      Nociception Level Index (NoL). NoL is an indexed value between 0 and 100 and is based on a
      non-linear combination of nociception-related physiological variables (including heart rate
      variation, plethysmograph pulse wave amplitude (PPGA) and changes in skin resistance).
      Possibly NoL is the first evidence-based clinical technology that can discriminate pain
      response when physiological response is not measured.

      The research field in the area of non-invasive objective monitoring of pain response in
      relation to patients' experience of pain is currently almost non-existent in anesthesia /
      anesthesia care This in turn can also lead to the development of patient safety both during
      anesthesia and after surgery at nursing department for example, patient-controlled and
      epidural pain relief in postoperative pain care. investigators intend to study the variation
      of the NoL index linked to the need for opioids during anesthesia and also after completed
      anesthesia when the patient wakes up and is in the ward.

      Investigators study patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS),
      concaplasty or lateral rhinotomy and who receive routine general anesthesia (anesthesia).
      These patients often have an age between 30-60 years and not infrequently assessed with
      regard to intraoperative and postoperative pain response. During the anesthesia study and
      after anesthesia, an equipment that monitors the pain response NoL (pain monitor) is used.

      This kind of pain monitor has been around for about 10 years. Over the past 5 years, its
      technology has evolved so much that in various countries it has become a monitoring system
      that is used as a complement to anesthesia.

      The study will be a randomized intervention study in which the random determines whether the
      patient's pain level is monitored using NoL or only according to traditional clinical
      assessment intra- and post-operatively. The patient will be assessed with the post-Qrs test,
      partly preoperatively (baseline) and partly post-operatively to assess the rate of recovery
      compared to baseline. The collected data is analyzed afterwards to possibly determine whether
      it is possible to determine differences in recovery, based on choice of pain monitoring
      method (Pain NoL or clinical assessment, pulse, blood pressure, BIS index, NoL index, amount
      of opioid intraoperatively and opioid amount postoperatively, VAS / NRS).

      Patients included in the study will be persons over the age of 18 and who agree to
      participate. Both women and men are included. Exclusion criteria include problems with the
      Swedish language or other communicative difficulties that make the assessment more difficult
      and patients with pacemakers.

      Both groups are anesthetized with propofol infusion and oxygen in the air, which is given
      analgesic remifentanil during surgery.

      Randomization is done through mixed, closed envelopes. Prior to the anesthesia, extra oxygen
      will be added and standard monitoring will be connected to the patient (ECG, noninvasive
      blood pressure measurement, saturation, NMT, NoL).

      Form, Postop-QRS test, with questions will be reviewed with the patient the day before or the
      same day as the surgery and postoperatively. The tests are intended to measure alertness,
      pain, nausea, vomiting and cognitive function and general recovery.

      The BIS index, NoL index, heart rate, blood pressure and saturation are regularly measured
      and recorded in special protocol. (NoL blinded, these index values are stored directly from
      the monitor on a so-called USB memory stick)
