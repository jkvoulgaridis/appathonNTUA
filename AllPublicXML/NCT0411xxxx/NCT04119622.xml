  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies. According to the global cancer
      statistics 2018, there were 1,033,701 new cases of gastric cancer per year, ranked the fifth
      place in new tumors, and 782,685 deaths, ranked the second place in cancer deaths. At
      present, surgery is the only way to cure gastric cancer, but the 5-year survival rate is only
      20%-30%. studies have confirmed that neoadjuvant therapy could improve the R0 resection rate
      and overall survival, which is considered a better treatment strategy.

      PD 1 monoclonal antibody is definitely effective in neoadjuvant therapy in other tumors such
      as NSCLC and bladder cancer, especially in PD-L1+ patients. However, there is no research of
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody in neoadjuvant therapy of gastric cancer. Thus we plan to conduct
      this prospective phase II clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of toripalimab,
      also known as JS001, in combination with XELOX for the neoadjuvant therapy of gastric cancer.

      This phase II trial is a single-arm, open Label, non-randomized and single-center clinical
      study. Patients who met the study criteria will receive the combination of toripalimab (240
      mg d1) with XELOX (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 QD, d1, capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 BID, d1-d14) of a
      3-week treatment cycle up to two cycles. After the second cycle of treatment, clinical
      efficacy evaluation will be done by MDT according to iRECIST. For patients with CR/PR/SD,
      surgery will be performed within 4 weeks. For patients with disease progress, MDT will
      determine whether the surgery could be performed. If resection could not be done, the
      patients would receive Original chemotherapy with toripalimab for 1 more cycle,
      chemoradiotherapy or the second line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is Major pathological
      response.
