    <measure>Correlation between daily physical activity and quality of life to disability.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>Daily physical activity will be measured 7 days assessed by ActiGraphTM wGT3X-BT. Person keep this on his/her wake-up time whole 7 days excluding time when she/he is in water like in shower or swimming. Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires 15-D and RAND-36 and disability will be assessed by EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) and also with MSFC (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite) measurement.</description>

    <measure>Correlation between fatigue and cognition to daily physical activity and disability.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with two different questionnaires FSS (fatigue severity scale) and MFIS (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale). Cognition will be assessed SDMT (Symbol Digital Modality Test) and PASAT-test. Daily physical activity will be measured 7 days with measure ActiGraphTM wGT3X-BT. Person keep this on his/her wake-up time whole 7 days excluding time when she/he is in water like in shower or swimming. Disability will be assessed EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) and also with MSFC (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite) measurement.</description>

    <measure>Disability level EDSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be assessed EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale). Scale range is between 0 to 10. (0 level is normal and 10 means death)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability level MSFC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be assessed MSFC (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite) measurement. Test include three different kind of test The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, The 9-HPT (9-hole peg test) and The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test &quot;PASAT&quot;). The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these three dimensions—arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score (the MSFC) that can be used to detect change over time in a group of multiple sclerosis patients. This is done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC and averaging them to create an overall composite score known as the MSFC score. ex. MSFC Score = {Zarm, average + Zleg, average + Zcognitive} / 3.0 Where Zxxx =Z-score</description>

    <measure>9-Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-HPT (9-hole peg test). The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed immediately by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). Record only the times for the two successfully completed trials for each hand. (time/within 0.1 seconds,lower time is better.)</description>

    <measure>The Timed 25-Foot Walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk test is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible. Record the subject's walk time to within 0.1 second, lower time is better)</description>

    <measure>Cognition level PASAT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition will be assessed with PASAT-test.(Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). The test score is the number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible) in each trial. Higher number is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue level FSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (one measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with questionnaire FSS (fatigue severity scale). FSS questionaire containing nine statements that attempt to explore severity of fatigue symptoms. The subject is asked to read each statement and circle a number from 1 to 7. The scoring is done by calculating the average response to the questions (adding up all the answers and dividing by nine). Higher number is worse.</description>
