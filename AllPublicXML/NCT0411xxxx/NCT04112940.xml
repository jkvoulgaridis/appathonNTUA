  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a larger grant, for which the overall goal is to collect measurements
      of liquid flow through the oropharynx (i.e., mouth and throat) during swallowing.The focus of
      this study is to evaluate the flow of liquids of varying consistency in the head and neck
      cancer population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thickened liquids are commonly used as an intervention for dysphagia (swallowing impairment).
      However, the field lacks a clear understanding of how liquids of different consistencies
      behave during swallowing. In order to improve understanding of the effectiveness of altered
      liquid consistency for improving dysphagia, the investigators are studying liquid flow
      through the oropharynx.

      This study explores this question in individuals who have undergone radiation treatment for
      head and neck cancer, specifically located in the oropharynx.

      Participants will swallow 20% w/v barium thickened to different consistencies (thin, slightly
      thick, mildly thick, moderately thick and extremely thick) using commercially available food
      thickeners. Swallowing will be observed under videofluoroscopy.

    <measure>Penetration-Aspiration Scale (Swallow Safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (single timepoint only)</time_frame>
    <description>The Penetration-Aspiration Scale (Rosenbek et al., 1996) is an 8-point categorical scale that will be used to characterize swallowing safety for each bolus based on the depth to which any material enters the airway and whether or not the material is ejected. Levels 1 and 2 on the scale are considered safe, while levels &gt; 3 are considered unsafe. Actual scale scores (1-8) will be recorded and then converted to binary categorical scores (&lt; 3 vs &gt;\= 3).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (single timepoint only)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the palatability of the different liquid stimuli using a 9-point hedonic categorical rating system previously described by Pelletier et al. The ratings use 9 descriptors to capture the degree to which a participant likes a stimulus, with anchors of &quot;Dislike extremely&quot; and &quot;Like extremely&quot;.</description>
