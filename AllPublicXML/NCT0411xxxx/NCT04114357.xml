  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data suggest that intestinal microbiota might be critically involved both in autoimmunity and
      in glucose homeostasis. An acetylated and butyrylated form of high amylose maize starch
      (HAMS-AB) that increases beneficial short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production has been safe
      and effective in disease prevention in mouse type 1 diabetes (T1D) models. The objective of
      this application is to assess the effect of administering a prebiotic, such as HAMS- AB, on
      the gut microbiome profile, glycemia and β-cell function in humans with T1D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single center clinical trial to evaluate the effect of using the prebiotic,
      HAMS-AB, on the gut microbiome profile, glycemia and β-cell function in children and
      adolescents ages 12-16 years with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

      Approximately 12 participants will be randomized first to take the supplement or follow a
      diabetic diet for 4 weeks and then cross-over after a 4 week washout period.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of using the prebiotic on the gut microbiome
      profile in youth with T1D.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of using the prebiotic on SCFA
      production, glycemia and β-cell health and function

    <description>We will compare β-cell measures pre/post intervention with HAMS-AB and between the intervention and control groups. We will assess β-cell function using mixed meal tolerance-derived C-peptide measures. We will assess β-cell stress using fasting proinsulin/C-peptide (PI:C) ratios. We will assess β-cell death by differential methylation of preproinsulin (INS) DNA.</description>
