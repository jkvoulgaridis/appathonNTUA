  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the potential deficits in emotion and craving regulation capacities of
      drug-naïve young adults with Internet gaming disorder as compared with healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in young adults' capacities of
      utilizing cognitive appraisal versus mindfulness to regulate negative emotions and/or craving
      in response to negative affective stimuli or gaming cues, respectively. This project will be
      conducted in Beijing, China.

    <description>Participants are instructed to complete the emotion assessment after Look or Decrease the neutral or negative pictures. The &quot;Decrease&quot; asks the participants to use &quot;cognitive reappraisal&quot; or &quot;mindfulness&quot; strategies to decrease the intensity of emotion, whereas the &quot;Look&quot; asks the participants to look naturally at the picture. First, the &quot;look&quot; or &quot;decrease&quot; is displayed on the computer for 2 s. Then, a neutral or negative picture is presented on the screen for 7s. Finally, participants will rate the intensity of their emotion for 4s. Then, they have 1s-3s to relax before the next trial. In the meantime, Skin conductance activities will be recorded using a constant voltage with 1-cm 3 AgAg/Cl electrodes attached to the medial phalanx surfaces of the middle and index fingers of the nondominant hand.</description>
