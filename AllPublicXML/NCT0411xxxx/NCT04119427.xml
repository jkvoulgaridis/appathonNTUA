      after renal transplantation.

      1. Study purposes: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of micro-energy ultrasound in the
           treatment of renal dysfunction after renal transplantation by measuring serum
           creatinine, urine volume, urea nitrogen, and transplanted kidney ultrasound, etc.

        2. Study design: This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter clinical
           trial.

        3. Study objects: Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency after renal
           transplantation.

        4. Number of samples: 90

        5. Main study center: Department of Urology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of
           Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

        6. Treatments:

      Test group: After installing the disposable treatment head coat, the transplanted kidney was
      treated with an ultrasonic therapeutic apparatus; after the treatment, the disposable
      treatment head coat was removed.Patients were treated twice a week for 6 weeks.

      Control group: The placebo was treated with an ultrasound therapy device and used in the same
      manner as the test group.
