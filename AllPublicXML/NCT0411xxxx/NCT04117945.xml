      This phase II trial how well regorafenib and anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab or panitumumab)
      works for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable), has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced), or has spread
      to other places in the body (metastatic). Regorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab
      or panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of
      taking regorafenib follow by cetuximab or panitumumab, to those that receive cetuximab or
      panitumumab before regorafenib.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the overall survival between evaluable patients who were randomized to receive
      regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive
      anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the first progression free survival (PFS1) of patients between evaluable
      patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody
      therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib
      II. To compare the second progression free survival (PFS2) of patients between evaluable
      patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody
      therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib.

      III. To compare the sequential treatment progression free survival (stPFS) of patients
      between evaluable patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR
      monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody
      followed by regorafenib.

      IV. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events between evaluable patients who
      were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy
      compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody followed by regorafenib.

      V. To compare the objective response rate (ORR), while on initial treatment, between
      evaluable patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by anti-EGFR
      monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody
      followed by regorafenib VI. To compare the objective response rate (ORR), while on sequential
      treatment, between evaluable patients who were randomized to receive regorafenib followed by
      anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy compared to those that receive anti-EGFR monoclonal
      antibody prior to regorafenib.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess plasma pharmacodynamics biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy.

      II. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Per the
      treating physician's discretion, patients who experience disease progression may initiate a
      treatment regimen consisting of cetuximab or panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients may also receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 as
      determined by the study doctor. Cycles repeat every 28 days until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive cetuximab or panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.
      Patients may also receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 as determined by the study doctor.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Per the treating physician's discretion, patients who experience disease progression may
      initiate a treatment regimen consisting of regorafenib PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3
      months for up to 3 years after randomization.
