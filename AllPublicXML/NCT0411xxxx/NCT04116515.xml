  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the effects of different versions of active video games
      (AVGs) on body composition, cardiometabolic risks, and cognitive functions among
      overweight/obese children over 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore the effects of narrative-enhanced AVG on (1) body composition, (2)
      cardiometabolic risks, and (3) cognitive functioning among overweight/obese 8-12 years old
      children over 6 months.

      A total of 210 children will be recruited from Tufts Floating Hospital, Boston Children's
      Hospital, and Martha Eliot Health Center. The investigators divided the participants into
      three groups to evaluate the effect of using active game consoles and stories to motivate
      children to exercise: A third of them have standard clinical care only; a third of them have
      the same standard clinical care plus an Xbox and active games; the remaining third of them
      have the same standard clinical care, an Xbox and active games, plus the stories delivered to
      their Xbox consoles.

      Each child, accompanied by their guardian, will be asked to visit the Northeastern University
      Exercise Science Laboratory over the 6-month period. Blood samples, body composition (using
      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DEXA Scan), and cognitive and affective evaluations of
      the active video games (AVGs) will be collected. Additionally, parents will be asked to fill
      out questionnaires related to their child's physical activity behaviors. Children would also
      be required to wear two accelerometers (essentially, a &quot;smart watch&quot; or activity tracker) on
      their wrist and waist for 7 consecutive days after the three visits within the 6 months.

    <description>Physical activity will be measured with two 7-day accelerometer worn on the wrist and hip after three visits over 4-6 weeks, including minutes/day MVPA total. Physical activity and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity will be measured by two triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph Link and Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph, Ft. Walton Beach, FL). Children will be asked to wear them for 7 full days during periods.</description>
