  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a very common, neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of
      headache, potential progression to more frequent and severe attack patterns, and associated
      symptoms. In Spain, the prevalence rates are 12-13% and in women up to 17-18% Migraine has
      been shown to largely impair patient's Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), affecting
      work, household chores, social activities and family life. Recurrent headache attacks and
      frequently persistent fear and concern about the next attack disrupt the patient's familial,
      occupational and social life, and reduce his/her expectations for career and financial
      future. The consequences of this loss of productivity is also shared in his/her private life
      with their family. For this reason, not only the clinical benefit but other dimensions as
      HRQoL or work affectation should be added to the study of the benefits of migraine treatment.

      Migraine pathophysiology pathways may be shared with other illness, such as fibromyalgia,
      chronic fatigue or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) . The purpose of the present clinical trial
      is to evaluate whether erenumab, at a target dose of 70 mg or 140 mg for a period of 12
      months, impacts Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) among patients withchronic migraine
      (CM) or High-Frequency Episodic Migraine (HFEM) who are affected with at least one
      comorbidity (fibromyalgia, fatigue and IBS). Data from this study, will provide additional
      information to help clinicians in treating patients with migraine and other illness.
