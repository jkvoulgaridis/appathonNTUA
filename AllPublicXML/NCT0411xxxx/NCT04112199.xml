  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of BIV201 (terlipressin diacetate) as a continuous infusion
      in addition to standard of care (diuretics and therapeutic paracentesis) for reduction of
      ascites and complications in adult patients with refractory ascites secondary to
      decompensated cirrhosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Terlipressin has been shown to reduce portal hypertension, improve renal function and induce
      natriuresis in cirrhotic patients with ascites without hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). It is
      approved in Europe for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices and HRS type 1 and is
      usually administered as an IV bolus starting at 1 mg every 6 h and increased to 2 mg every 6
      h (maximum 8 mg/day depending on response).

      This study will evaluate the use of terlipressin delivered by continuous infusion for two 28
      day treatment cycles for reduction of ascites accumulation and complications in adult
      patients with refractory ascites secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. Continuous infusion
      allows for a significant reduction in the daily effective dose required for treatment and
      improved safety of terlipressin delivered as a low-dose continuous infusion could enable its
      use in the outpatient setting in the prolonged treatment of patients with refractory ascites.
