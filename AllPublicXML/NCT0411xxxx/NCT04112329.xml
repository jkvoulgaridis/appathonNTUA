  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess if playing a newly developed videogame that require
      physical activity (e.g. exergame) can lead to increased physical activity, aerobic fitness
      and health benefits in sedentary adults. The project will include 28 sedentary adults, 18
      years and above, who are not sufficiently active according to current guidelines defined as
      doing (&lt;150 minutes/week of moderate intensity physical activity or &lt;75 minutes/week of
      vigorous physical activity and/or do not do any regular endurance training ). The physical
      fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), blood pressure, body composition and objectively
      measured physical activity will be tested before and after the intervention period.

      Also, the participants gaming frequency will be registered throughout the 8 week period. Aim
      of this study is to investigate if access to this game can provide health benefits for adults
      who are not motivated to take part in regular physical activity.
