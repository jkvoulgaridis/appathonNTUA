  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that instillation of (T3) into the airspace will increase alveolar fluid
      clearance in patients with ARDS, resulting in reduced extravascular lung water (EVLW).

      Randomized, unblinded, intervention versus non-intervention trial

      Purpose: To determine the safety and tolerability of T3 delivery into the lungs of ARDS
      patients, and to measure the effect of T3 on EVLW index in ARDS patients.

      Liothyronine Sodium (T3), 5-10-25-50µg will be instilled via catheter through ETT into the
      airways in a total volume of 10 ml (T3+0.9% sodium chloride) over 4 days (96 hours) with
      progressive dosing.

      68 participants [50 treatment + 18 controls] will be investigated over 18 months or until
      target enrollment is achieved. No research intervention will occur with control subjects.
      Control subjects will receive standard of care.

    <measure>Change in Extravascular Lung Water Index (EVLWI)</measure>

    <description>EVLWI is calculated as ml of extravascular lung water fluid reported by VolumeView system (Edwards Lifesciences) divided by patient's body weight in kg. EVLWI will be measured at baseline and 1 hour post T3 installation to calculate change in EVLWI. Lower EVLWI values indicate greater treatment efficacy.</description>

    <description>EVLWI is calculated as ml of extravascular lung water fluid reported by VolumeView system (Edwards Lifesciences) divided by patient's body weight in kg.

    <measure>Change in Arterial Oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>On clinically indicated ABGs (about 1 hour after admission), then 24 hours post T3 installation</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial partial pressure of oxygen will be sampled by arterial catheter (reported as mmHg) upon admission and then 24 hours after the first dose of T3 to calculate change in arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Increased arterial partial pressure of oxygen indicates greater treatment efficacy.</description>
