  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized double-blinded controlled phase 2 study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of the anti-CMV drug valganciclovir vs placebo as add-on therapy in
      patients with glioblastoma. Valganciclovir is approved for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV)
      infections, but may also have anti-tumoral effects. Current evidence imply that most
      glioblastomas are CMV positive and that the virus can affect tumor aggressiveness.

      Adult patients will either be randomized to standard treatment (temozolomide and radiation
      therapy) + placebo tablets or to standard treatment + valganciclovir. Patients are randomized
      using 1 to 1 distribution of the patients between the treatment groups and are stratified
      according to methylation status of the MGMT promoter; equal proportion of patients are
      included in each group. A maximum of 30% of patients with methylated MGMT promoter are
      allowed into the study (to harmonise with current data used for statistical power
      calculation), as MGMT promotor methylation status is prognostic for patient survival.
      Patients must enter the study within 10 weeks after surgery.

      Full dose treatment with 900mgs of Valganciclovir is given twice daily for 6 weeks,
      thereafter 900 mgs daily during 98 weeks (total treatment of 24 months). Valganciclovir is
      available in 450 mg tablets. The dose of Valganciclovir will be adjusted according to renal
      function.

      This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, ICH-GCP, the declaration of
      Helsinki and applicable Swedish regulatory requirements.

      The study discontinuation criteria are as follows:

        -  Withdrawal of consent

        -  An adverse event which requires discontinuation of the trial medication or results in

        -  inability to continue to comply with trial procedures

        -  Disease progression which results in inability to continue to comply with trial

        -  procedures

        -  Major Protocol deviations

        -  Exclusion criteria met

    <intervention_model_description>A multicenter randomized double-blinded controlled phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy of valganciclovir as add-on therapy in glioblastoma patients. Patients will receive either placebo or valganciclovir according to a randomisation list, blinded to the sponsor and study team. Seven centers are aimed to include patients once approval is received for each respective study center.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>VIGAS 2 is conducted under a randomised double blinded protocol. The study team and the patients are blinded to the randomisation list. Randomisation is performed by the contracted Clinical Cancer Center Unit at the Karolinska University Hospital by an unblinded person, Claudia Maes who holds responsibility to select out number codes for coded cans of the study drug. Claudia Maes is unrelated to the sponsor and the study team.</masking_description>

    <measure>Impact of valganciclovir on median overall survival of glioblastoma patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Study closure at 30 months follow up. Survival analyses will be analysed at 12 and 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Median overall survival will be analyzed using Cox regression analysis and presented by Kaplan-Meier graphs. Proportion of patients alive at 12 or 24 months, respectively, in each study arm and will be analyzed using Fisher exact test.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline and demographic data</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>All baseline and demographic data will be analysed using descriptive statistics such as mean, medians, standard deviations etc. for all variables which are continuous. Variables that are categorical will be analysed using frequency tables with number of patients and percent. All these analyses will be divided by treatment group. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed for the demographic and baseline variables.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival at 12 and 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor recurrence is estimated as clinical and radiological determination (RANO criteria and NANO criteria). The progression free survival will be calculated as the (date of progression - date of first dose of study drug). Patients who are alive without progression at end of follow-up will be censored. Patients who are withdrawn from the study during the follow-up for other reason than dead will be censored at time of withdrawal. Patients who dies for any reason during the follow-up without any progression will be classified as progression using date of death as date of progression. Patients are analysed for stable disease, surgical interventions and treatment failure.
Progression free survival will be analysed using Cox regression analysis and presented by Kaplan-Meier graphs. The difference in 12 and 24 months progression free survival rates for patients treated with valganciclovir or placebo will be analysed using Fisher exact test.</description>
