      This study examines: 1) short-term and longitudinal impacts of stepped care on women with
      depression and the possible roles of mediators and moderators; 2) clinic- (readiness to adopt
      an innovation, leadership support and climate) and provider-level (preparedness, motivation
      and fidelity) factors that may affect stepped care implementation; and 3) the differential
      impact of two implementation approaches (a clinic implementation teams versus implementation
      training by the research team). It utilizes Curran's hybrid effectiveness implementation
      design, mixed methods, and a longitudinal design with assessments at pre, 3 months, 6 months,
      and 12 months. A total of 18 primary care clinics, set in both rural and urban communities in
      Tajikistan, will be involved, with 12 delivering the intervention and 6 acting as controls. 8
      providers (3 nurses, 3 peers, and 2 doctors) will be recruited at each of the 12 intervention
      clinics for a total of 96 providers; 35 women with depression will be recruited from each
      clinic for a total of 630 women.

      This research will advance mental healthcare task sharing in effectiveness and implementation
      testing of a stepped care model for LMICs. It uses nurses and mental health peers to treat
      depression and potential co-occurring anxiety among women in primary care. The study
      addresses Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal C to foster integration of mental
      health into primary care and NIMH Strategic Aim 3 by developing new and better interventions
      that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. It
      utilizes Curran's hybrid effectiveness implementation design. To improve implementation, it
      examines the impact of clinic implementation teams in readying the clinic and service
      providers. Additionally, it explores how RDoC neuroscience contributes to implementation
      science through enhancing the evaluation and targeting of stepped care. This study will
      enable new collaborative research activities, in tandem with network building, mentorship and
      training, and dissemination of findings, which will further build the LMIC capacity for
      implementation science research and development of evidence-based medicine by strengthening
      Tajikistan's individual and institutional research capabilities.

      Globally, young women bear a disproportionate burden of common mental disorders, and
      especially including depression and potentially co-occurring anxiety. With current care
      models, this burden cannot be lifted without finding ways to deliver mental health prevention
      and treatment services and illness self-management to women in primary care. Our previous
      research in Tajikistan has demonstrated that women are exposed to serious risks for mental
      illness, and how peers and primary care nurses have played major but largely informal roles
      in helping women with mental health problems. Therefore, the investigators developed and
      tested for feasibility a stepped care model which showed very strong treatment effects. This
      stepped care model involves three steps. Step 1 is a peer and nurse co-led 8-session group
      based upon BRIDGES. Step 2 is peer or nurse led 6-session individual meetings based upon
      Interpersonal Psychotherapy. Step 3 is primary care physician led medication treatment with
      Amitriptyline.

      This project will scale-up the intervention in multiple polyclinics, so as to examine its
      effectiveness (Aim 2) and to compare two implementation strategies (Aim 3). This presents a
      remarkable opportunity to advance both services and science of mental health in Tajikistan.

      Aim 1. To assess the effectiveness of the stepped care model with 420 women who have
      depression and potential co-occurring anxiety, recruited from 12 primary care clinics in
      Tajikistan, compared with standard of care plus provision of healthy lifestyle materials,
      with another 210 women recruited from 6 primary care clinics, including assessing mediators
      and moderators (e.g. executive control efficiency, trauma exposure).

      Aim 2. To assess whether a clinic implementation team moderates women's reduction in
      depression post-intervention, as well as clinic-level (leadership support and degree of
      implementation) and provider-level (motivation and fidelity) moderators.

      Aim 3. To establish a national mental health research network that focuses on improving the
      standard of mental health care and access to services by building mental health
      implementation research capacity.

    <measure>change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2. Score of 0-7 = normal; 8-13 = mild depression; 14-18 = moderate depression; 19-22 = severe depression, +23 = very severe depression.</description>

    <measure>change in Texas Christian University (TCU) Organizational Readiness for Change</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Motivational factors include program needs, training needs, and pressures for change, while program resources are evaluated in regard to office facilities, staffing, training, equipment, and the Internet. Organizational dynamics include scales on staff attributes and climate.
Numbers for each item indicate its location in the administration version, in which response categories are 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree; Â® designates items with reflected scoring. Scores for each scale are obtained by summing responses to its set of items (after reversing scores on reflected items by subtracting the item response from &quot;6&quot;), dividing the sum by number of items included (yielding an average) and multiplying by 10 in order to rescale final scores so they range from 10 to 50 (e.g., an average response of 2.6 for a scale becomes a score of &quot;26&quot;).</description>

    <measure>change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) measures the severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity, and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <measure>change in PTSD Checklist for DSM- 5</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. The PCL-5 has a variety of purposes, including monitoring symptom change during and after treatment, screening individuals for PTSD, making a provisional PTSD diagnosis.Respondents are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each of 20 items in the past month on a 5- point Likert scale ranging from 0 not at all, 1 a little bit, 2 moderately, 3 quite a bit, 4 extremely. Items are summed to provide a total severity score (range = 0-80).Summing all 20 items and using cut-point score of 33 appears to be reasonable based upon current psychometric work.</description>

    <measure>change in Evidence Based Practice Attitude Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This tool (EBPAS) examines attitudes toward evidence-based practice among social service providers. The tool includes 15 questions regarding clinician and case manager willingness to adopt evidence-based practices given the appeal of evidence-based practice, system, organization, or supervisor requirements for evidence-based practices. The four scales are labeled as &quot;Requirements scale&quot; (3 items), &quot;Appeal scale&quot; (4 items), &quot;Openness scale&quot; (4 items), &quot;Divergence scale&quot; (4 items). A higher score indicates &quot;more&quot; of the scale name, except for Divergence</description>

    <description>Standard outpatient care supplemented with literature on healthy lifestyles will serve as an enhanced control condition. In each clinic, non-specialty mental health care is available in the form of counseling from doctors or nurses along with psychiatric medication management. Given the difficulties faced by women in Tajikistan, ethical responsibility compels us to enhance the control condition by having nurses distribute written materials on healthy eating, physical fitness, and personal hygiene, at a reading level which will be widely accessible.</description>
