  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatoduodenectomy is the preferred surgical method for periampullary diseases. The most
      common complication is gastric emptying disorder, which often greatly affects the quality of
      life of patients and prolongs the length of hospitalization. There are few reports on the
      treatment of gastric emptying disorder with single method, poor continuity of curative effect
      and low level of evidence. This study is to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of ear
      acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of DGE after pancreaticoduodenal surgery. This
      study is divided into two parts. The first part is to study the clinical efficacy and safety
      of auricular acupoint embedding in preventing gastric emptying disorder after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. The second part is to study the clinical efficacy and safety of
      electroacupuncture in treating gastric emptying disorder.

    <description>Auricular Acupuncture (AA) is a micro-system of acupuncture and moxibustion initiated by Chinese and French doctors. All acupoints are distributed in the ear. In the treatment of perioperative patients, ear needle is far away from the surgical wound and its minimally invasive and tolerable position has obvious advantages over body needle.AA can regulate the function of corresponding organs at acupoints. The theoretical basis of TCM is holistic concept and syndrome differentiation and treatment.AA can prevent and treat perioperative nausea and vomiting. A number of randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies have confirmed that AA has obvious advantages in preventing nausea and vomiting in perioperative period compared with routine prevention, and its possible mechanism is ear-directed stimulation of the ear branch of vagus nerve, thereby enhancing gastrointestinal motility and accelerating gastric emptying.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy;

          -  No delayed gastric emptying or gastrointestinal obstruction before operation.

          -  ECOG score 0-2;

          -  No opioid analgesia or gastrointestinal motility drugs were administered for more than
             one week before operation.

          -  Adequate blood cell counts were available during the screening period.

          -  The blood biochemical indexes during screening period were as follows (48 hours before
             operation to 14 days before operation): AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) were less than or equal
             to the upper limit of 2.5 times normal value (ULN). Total bilirubin is less than or
             equal to 300 micromol/L. ULN serum creatinine is within the normal limit, or the level
             of serum creatinine is higher or lower than the normal value of institutions, but the
             calculated clearance rate is greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. If the
             creatinine clearance rate is used, the actual body weight should be used to calculate
             the creatinine clearance rate (e.g. using the Cockroft-Gault formula).

          -  Coagulation function is normal.

          -  Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating women who were older than or equal to 18 years
             old signed the informed consent. If a female patient is of childbearing age (regular
             menstrual proof), the pregnancy test (such as serum beta-hCG) before the first study
             of drug administration must be negative. If patients are sexually active, they must
             agree to use contraceptive methods that researchers believe are adequate and
             appropriate during the study of drug administration. In addition, male and female
             patients must take contraceptive measures after treatment, as recommended by the
             product prescription information provided in the study manual.

          -  The patient has been informed of the nature of the study and has agreed to participate
             in the study and signed an informed consent before participating in any
             research-related activities.

          -  Ability to comply with research visits and other programme requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient did not receive standard pancreaticoduodenectomy.

          -  Myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery or
             peripheral artery bypass grafting, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade III-IV
             heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack or epileptic
             seizure occurred within 30 days before operation.

          -  Any condition that may impair patient safety or the integrity of research data,
             including serious medical risk factors, medical events, laboratory abnormalities or
             psychiatric disorders;

          -  The patient's access to any other clinical study or to a trial of an interventional
             drug may interfere with the evaluation of this study procedure.

          -  Patients are unwilling or unable to follow the research procedure;

          -  Researchers do not think it is suitable for inclusion.

          -  Acupuncture and moxibustion is currently used or used in the past 30 days.

          -  Ear trauma or unhealed ear wound
