    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify early immune markers associated with response to
      treatment with abatacept in individuals with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this open label
      mechanistic study, participants who were recently diagnosed with T1D (males or females, ages
      6-45 and &lt;7months from T1D diagnosis) will be treated with a short-course of abatacept
      (weekly subcutaneous injections for 3 months). Participants will undergo baseline and
      repeated mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT) to assess disease progression and blood samples
      will be obtained at frequent intervals to measure changes in immune markers.

             assessment

          3. Males and females 6-45 years of age, inclusive, at time of screening visit

          4. Peak MMTT stimulated C-peptide ≥ 0.2 pmol/ml

          5. Females of child-bearing age must be willing to use effective birth control for 1 year
             (which may include abstinence) from screening visit and undergo regular pregnancy
             testing

          6. Up to date for clinically recommended immunizations prior to screening

          7. Willing to forgo live vaccines 3 months prior to the screening visit until three
             months following last study drug administration

          8. Willing and able to give informed consent or have parent or legal guardian provide
             informed consent if the subject is &lt; 18 years of age

             received ≥ 2 weeks of exogenous insulin therapy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent or recent (within the past 30 days of screening MMTT (visit -1)) use of

             count abnormalities (such as lymphopenia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia).
