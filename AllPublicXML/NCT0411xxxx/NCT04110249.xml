  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well photoacoustic imaging works in measuring tumors and normal tissue
      in patients with head and neck cancer. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a low-risk imaging
      method that provides information about the oxygenation of tissues using a combination of
      light and ultrasound techniques. This study may help doctors determine if PAI is correlated
      with clinical responses of both tumor (for example: shrinking, swelling or disappearing) and
      normal tissues (for example: skin redness, dry mouth, appearance of sores, healing of skin or
      mucosa). If there is a correlation with clinical responses, then doctors may develop PAI as
      method for measuring response to earlier treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Define the feasibility of the current photoacoustic imaging (PAI) technology in head and
      neck (H&amp;N) cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Define the utility of the current PAI in H&amp;N cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      PART I: Patients undergo PAI before the start of chemoradiation therapy, weekly during 7
      weeks of chemoradiation, and again 3-4 months after completion of chemoradiation therapy.

      PART II (CANCER-FREE WITH XEROSTOMIA): Patients undergo PAI at baseline, up to twice during
      acupuncture-like transcutaneous nerve stimulation (ALTENS) therapy, once after ALTENS, and at
      3-6 months follow up.
