  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been believed that the risk of pulmonary aspiration in term pregnant women is
      increased, and should be considered that all term pregnant women to have &quot;full stomach&quot;.
      Recently, gastric ultrasound has been adopted as a useful tool for quantitative and
      qualitative assessment of stomach before anesthesia, and predict the risk of pulmonary
      aspiration.

      Although, both the obesity and pregnancy are known to be the risk of pulmonary aspiration, it
      is suggested in the American Society of Anesthesiology fasting guidelines, that the same
      fasting time should be applied in the obese and non-obese parturients. However, this was
      based on one study done in a small (10) numbers of volunteers.

      Therefore, the investigators aimed to compare the gastric antral cross-sectional area in both
      obese and non-obese term pregnant women, scheduled for elective cesarean section.

      This study is a prospective, observational study. 42 term (≥37 weeks) pregnant, non-laboring
      adult women scheduled for cesarean delivery will be included in the study. They will be
      allowed to drink water freely, until 2 hours before the anesthesia. Gastric ultrasound will
      be performed in 21 non-obese women, and 21 obese women. The obesity is defined by the body
      mass index at term.
