  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects 8% of the entire population. 4-5% of asthma sufferers have severe asthma,
      characterised by recurrent exacerbations (worsening of symptoms leading to the person having
      a bout of corticosteroids and/or antibiotics), significant symptoms and lack of response to
      the most widely used therapy, corticosteroids.

      There is now new types of treatments (antibody drugs) which are licensed to manage severe
      asthma such as Anti-IL5. There is evidence Anti-IL5 and other similar antibody drugs are
      effective at reducing asthma exacerbations and reduce the need for oral corticosteroids for
      those that have severe asthma.

      However, some patients respond poorly to Anti-IL5 and the investigators would like to find
      out why this happens. It is hoped that the investigators can identify the mechanism of poor
      treatment response to Anti-IL5. It is also hoped that the investigators can understand why
      symptoms worsen to the point of requiring antibiotics and/or steroids (also known as an
      exacerbation) for those prescribed Anti-IL5.

    <description>Identification of mechanisms associated with poor response to anti-IL5 therapy. A poor response is defined as an inability to halve the pre-treatment annualised exacerbation rate; an asthma exacerbation is defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms necessitating a short burst of oral corticosteroids, or a doubling of maintenance oral corticosteroid treatment dose.</description>

        Participants will be recruited from the severe asthma clinic. Once the multidisciplinary
        team (MDT) have decided that the patient will be prescribed anti-IL5 therapy a patient
        information sheet (PIS) will be posted out by the clinical team. If the appointment with
        the clinical team is within days of the MDT, potential participant will be approached by a
        member of the research team and the study will be discussed and a patient information sheet
        will be given to the patient.

        Control participants will be recruited from our Respiratory Research Database and have
        agreed to be contacted for research. A poster will be created to be put up in Nottingham
        City Hospital, Queen's Medical Centre and at the University of Nottingham, UK.

        Inclusion criteria: case participants:

          -  Aged 18 - 80 years old

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  All patients identified as being suitable for anti-IL5 therapy by the asthma MDT will
             be considered for study enrolment.

        This assessment by the MDT for participants to be eligible includes:

          -  A measure of compliance with current asthma medication,

          -  Confirmation of asthma diagnosis

          -  Suitability for anti-IL5 therapy based on blood eosinophil counts,

          -  Asthma exacerbation rates

          -  Prednisolone dose.

          -  Confirmation of treatment requires at least two asthma specialists to agree that this
             is the correct course of action

          -  Patients must first demonstrate over 75% compliance with inhaled and/or oral
             corticosteroid therapy

        The asthma MDT and difficult asthma clinic normally assess patients between 18-80 years so
        only patients in this age range will be approached.

        All patients will be able to give informed consent for study participation.
