  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label, single center, dose escalation study to determine a safe and
      effective maximum tolerated dose of HS-130 in combination with viagenpumatucel-L (HS-110) for
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumors who are refractory to Standard of Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, first-in-human Phase I study of HS-130 and HS-110 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, Standard of Care.

      Seven dose levels will be explored in escalating doses. For each dose level, patients will
      receive combination HS-130 and HS-110 via intradermal injections once every 14 days. The Dose
      Limiting Toxicity (DLT) window of observation will include the first 28 days of treatment. In
      the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, patients will continue to
      receive combination treatment every two weeks until disease progression, death, patient's
      withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or intolerable
      toxicity, whichever occurs first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             screening if sample was collected within 6-months from Cycle 1 Day 1, and the local
             pathologist confirms that an adequate amount of tissue/tumor cells exist to allow

                  first dose.

             Prophylactic treatment with antibiotics (e.g. for dental extractions) is allowed.

         14. Known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or
             hepatitis C (except in cases of immunity after cured infection). Testing not required.
