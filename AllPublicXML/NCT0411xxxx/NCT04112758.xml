  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study mainly investigates the effect of high-intensity interval training on inhibitory
      control in children with ADHD by using event-related potential and sLORETA techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will have two experiments, one is a cross-section study and the other is
      intervention study.

      As for cross-section study, typical developmental children and children with ADHD will
      perform the inhibitory task with non-emotional and emotional stimulus while recording their
      brain waves.

      The intervention is twice a week for 5 weeks and before and after the intervention, children
      with ADHD will randomly assign to either an exercise group or control group. They will
      perform the inhibitory task while recording their brain waves.

    <description>Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity will be measured at 64 sites. The amplitude of the ERN is deﬁned as the mean amplitude within a 100-ms interval surrounding the maximal positive peak within a 50- to 100-ms latency window.</description>

    <description>To examine sources relating to amplitude in ERPs, source localization will be conducted using standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) The sLORETA analysis with the ERP data will be selected by four 100 ms bins covering the period from 0 to 200 ms after stimulus-onset (0-50, 50-100, 100-150, and 150-200 ms).</description>
