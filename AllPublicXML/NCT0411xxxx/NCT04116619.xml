    <textblock>
      This research project proposes a novel approach to elucidate the biological adaptations
      associated with Cannabis Use Disorder and to assess whether such adaptations are predictive
      of higher drug craving in response to both drug cues and stressors in both the laboratory and
      real-world, and higher relapse risk and drug use in the real world.

      The intent of this study is to recruit 25 treatment-seeking individuals with Cannabis Use
      Disorder (CUD) and 25 light users (&lt;1 joint/week) to complete three guided imagery conditions
      (stress, cannabis, neutral) in inpatient research units. During the guided imagery, repeated
      measurements of subjective (i.e., craving, negative affect), neuroendocrine (i.e., cortisol),
      and physiological variables (i.e., heart rate variability [HRV]) will be collected.
      Thereafter, individuals with CUD will begin one-month of drug counseling treatment coupled
      with surveys delivered via smartphones daily in the morning, evening, and at four random
      times during the day.

    <description>Participants will report using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) their current levels of stress and craving, if they have used marijuana, and if they experienced a stressor. These reports will be generated in three different ways: at 8 am and 8 pm at night, at four random times during waking hours, and during marijuana use. Individuals with CUD will be compared to light marijuana users in their differences in real-world ratings of stress and craving. Craving and stress will be assessed using a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS) in which 0=&quot;Not at all&quot; and 100=&quot;Extremely High.&quot;</description>

    <description>On days 1, 2 and 3 of the study, subjects will come to the research testing rooms and be provided with lunch before beginning the laboratory session. After a 40-minute adaptation period, two blood samples will be drawn before imagery (BASELINE). After the second blood draw, a 5-minute baseline period will follow to assess continuous pulse rate, BP, and HRV assessments. The subject and research staff conducting the sessions will be blinded to the order and content of the imagery condition. In each recording, the subjects will listen to the scripts over headphones and will vividly imagine the described situation, 'as if' it were happening right now,&quot; for 5 minutes. The research nurse will take a blood draw immediately after the imagery (IMAGERY). After that, three recovery blood draws will be performed at 15-minute intervals (RECOVERY). We will analyze the total of six blood samples for levels of cortisol.</description>
