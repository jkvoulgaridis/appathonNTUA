  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of study is to analyze the effects of dual task training on balance, gait, cognition
      and neurotrophic factors in Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease will be randomly assigned to either
      intervention or control group. And 10 healty subjects will be included to study in order to
      determine the reference values.The intervention group will be recieved cognitive and motor
      dual task training consisting of balance and walking activities 3 days a week for 8 weeks.
      Control group will be recieved same balance and walking activities in single task condition 3
      days a week for 8 weeks. In order to evaluate the effects of the training, evaluations will
      be performed before and after the training period.
