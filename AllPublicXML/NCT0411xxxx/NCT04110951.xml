  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the asthma patients prefer complementary and integrative applications as they
      continue to experience asthma symptoms despite pharmacological treatment. Pranayama, one of
      these treatments, is a breathing-based technique and is a part of yoga, an ancient Indian
      science. This study was carried out as randomized controlled single blind study in order to
      analyze the effect of pranayama breathing technique applied to individuals suffering from
      asthma on asthma control, pulmonary functions and quality of life. The study comprised 50
      patients in total, as 25 patients in pranayama group and 25 patients in control group. The
      approval of ethics committee, permissions from the institutions, and informed voluntary
      approval of the individuals were obtained to conduct the research. The data of the research
      were collected through the application of Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (AQLQ), pulmonary function test (PFT), and patient observation chart. Pranayama
      breathing technique was applied to pranayama group 20 minutes once a day for four weeks, and
      relaxation technique was applied to relaxation group similarly in addition to standard
      treatment. ACT, AQLQ, and PFT were evaluated twice as before and after the one month of
      application process. Meanwhile, the patients' PEF measurements were followed with individual
      PEF meter on daily basis. The value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted statistically significant in the
      data analyses.

    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma Control Test (ACT) is composed of 5 main sections involving asthma influence level of patients due to daily actions of patients, frequency of asthma symptoms at daytimes and nights, need of urgent relaxing drug, and evaluation of disease by patients. Patients are required to respond each question with values between 1 and 5. Total score of these 5 questions ranges between 5 and 25</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Standard Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) is a quality of life questionnaire specific to asthma comprising 32 questions. AQLQ was developed by Juniper et al. (1993) to use in clinical studies. The questionnaire evaluates responses through a 7 scores scale (1: severely impaired; 7: not impaired at all) based on changes in last two weeks regarding asthma. Standard AQLQ involves 12 questions about symptoms, 11 questions about activity limitation, 5 questions about emotional functions, and 4 questions about environment stimuli. Mean scores are calculated for subcategories and overall scores. The mean of obtained scores are evaluated between 1 and 7. The minimum score change clinically accepted important in the questionnaire is 0.50 and this situation is called &quot;minimal significant difference&quot; .</description>

    <measure>Peak Ekspiratuar Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Peak Ekspiratuar Flow (PEF) measurement kind of test which can be accomplished through mobile hand-held tools that enable patients to follow their situations even at their own homes in asthma diagnose and treatment. Repeatability of the test is very high though its application is connected with effort. As PEF measurement gives information about big airways, lower values are obtained in comparison to FEV1 value at 30-50% of the patients. In PEF follow-up, the best PEF value of patient value is primarily defined. Because, the follow-up of patient is conducted in terms of his/her best value not in terms of prediction value indifferent to spirometer in PEF follow-up.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume First Second</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), measured during breathing function test and a flow velocity, is the best indicator of obstruction in asthma. However, FEV1 reflects real obstruction only with powerful and maximum effort as it mostly related with effort.</description>

    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Effort related part of forced vital capacity (FVC) reflects airways, pulmonary expriratory muscles and the situation of lung elastic recession power.</description>

    <measure>FEV1/FVC</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one month</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1/FVC rate is an important final parameter in defining obstruction as there is not a great change observed in FVC values at early stages of the disease in most of the asthma patients.</description>

    <description>Kapalbhati, Ujjayi and Anuloma-Viloma pranayama techniques were applied to the experimental group. Within this scope, a three days of applied training program was prepared and a guide involving the steps of Pranayama breathing technique was formed. The patients in of pranayama group were trained by the researcher who had yoga trainer certificate. After completing three days of training and observations regarding their accomplishment of applications properly, a pranayama breathing technique video showing how the pranayama breathing technique is done with its details was downloaded to their smartphones and a guide including the application steps was distributed to the patients. The patients were required to apply pranayama technique, in company with the video, 20 min every day and a month in total.</description>

    <description>As there was not placebo breathing control treatment appropriate to yoga breathing technique, relaxation technique was decided to apply in the second group to equalize psychological effects of the treatment. Progressive relaxation technique was taught to the relaxation group during the same training span.A three days of applied training program and Relaxation Technique Application Guide, including steps of progressive relaxation technique, were prepared within this scope. After completing three days of training and observations regarding their accomplishment of applications properly, a relaxing music to listen during applications and a training video involving progressive relaxation directives were downloaded to smartphones of the patients. Also, Relaxation Technique Application Guide involving application steps were distributed to the patients. The patients were required to apply relaxation technique, in company with the video, 20 min every day and a month in total.</description>
