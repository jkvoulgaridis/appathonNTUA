  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish the effectiveness of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm
      (DERM) to determine the presence of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma
      (SCC) and frequently observed benign conditions, when used to analyse images of skin lesions
      taken by commonly available smart phone cameras.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DERM, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis support tool, has been shown to be able
      to accurately identify Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and other conditions from historical
      images of suspicious skin lesions (moles). This study aims to establish how well DERM
      determines the presence of these conditions in images of skin lesions collected in a clinical
      setting.

      Suspicious skin lesions that are due to be assessed by a dermatologist and a patch of healthy
      skin will be photographed using three commonly available smart phone cameras with a specific
      lens attachment. The images will be analysed by DERM, and the results compared to the
      clinician's diagnosis (all lesions) and histologically-conformed diagnosis (any lesion that
      is biopsied).

    <description>Recruited participants will be attending a dermatology clinic with at least one skin lesion where there is a suspicion of skin cancer. All suspicious lesions suitable for photographing will be photographed six times in a single visit. A macro and dermoscopic image of each lesion will be captured by three different mobile phones: an iPhone, a Samsung and a Nokia smart phone, without (macro image) or with (dermoscopic image) a Dermlite DL1 lens attached. Dermoscopic images of healthy skin will also be captured by each camera. Images of the lesions will be analysed by DERM. The DERM results for lesions biopsied will be compared to the biopsy result; the DERM results for lesions not biopsied will be compared to the clinical assessment.</description>
