      The aim of the study was to describe an intensive ultra rush (UR) protocol of raw Golden
      apple (RGA) reintroduction in 28 in-patients, show the protocol's tolerance and the patients'
      follow-up at 2 months and 1 year. Patients with oral allergic syndrome (OAS) having resulted
      in raw fruits eviction were admitted to day hospital between June 1 2016 and October 31 2017.

      The aim of this study was to describe an intensive ultra rush (UR) protocol of raw Golden
      apple (RGA) reintroduction in 28 in-patients, show the protocol's tolerance and the patients'
      follow-up at 2 months and 1 year. Patients with oral allergic syndrome (OAS) having resulted
      in raw fruits eviction were admitted to day hospital between June 1 2016 and October 31 2017.

      Methods : Patients were included during the first consultation, UR was performed with RGA in
      day hospital performed in two institutions, the Charcot clinic and the polyclinic of
      Beaujolais.

      Starting with 1 gram (g) of food, then by regularly doubling dose from 2g to 128g, to reach a
      255g cumulative dose in a 3 hour period.

      During the the post hospitalization period, patients back home had to eat ½ RGA a day during
      one month, then 1 RGA a day during one month, together with other rosacea fruits resumption
      at the end of the 5th week if UR were performed between April 15th and July 15th. A synthesis
      consultation was made at two months and a telephone interview at one year.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' tolerance to Golden apple re-consumption according to a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Day 1]</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the patients' tolerance to apple re-consumption was made during the ultra-rush protocol according to a scale inspired by the Hansen et al. classification, but the VAS used was graduated from 0 to 10 (and not from 0 to 3). This scale was enhanced with a three-color rule: the scale measured 3 levels of Oral Allergic Syndrome (OAS) severity: with no or mild side effects associated with the green color (0 to 3 on the scale), with moderate side effect associated with the orange color (4 to 6 on the scale) defined as moderate OAS (limited to oral cavity), and with severe side effect associated with red color (7 to 10 on the scale) defined as severe OAS (oral cavity together with systemic symptoms).
Green color corresponds to good tolerability, orange color to mixed results, and red color is correlated to poor tolerability.</description>

    <description>Measurement of side effects during Ultra-Rush (UR) and for the next two months according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) used for the study.
The 0-10 graduated scale was enhanced with a three-color rule: the scale measured 3 levels of Oral Allergic Syndrome (OAS) severity: with no or mild side effects (green color), with moderate side effect (orange color), and with severe side effect (red color).
During UR, side effects intensity was evaluated on the VAS at each UR step. After UR and for the next two months, patients recorded daily the side effects on a notebook, using the same tool. These records were transcribed in the patients medical file by investigator.</description>

    <description>Tolerance was evaluated at the two months post Ultra-Rush visit, using the VAS.
