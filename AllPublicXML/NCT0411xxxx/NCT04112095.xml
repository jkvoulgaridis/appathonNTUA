  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess whether consumers select and use norgestrel 0.075 mg, a
      progestin only pill for contraception, in a manner consistent with the OTC package directions
      in an Over-the-Counter (OTC)-like setting.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be primarily recruited via passive recruiting methods, such as in-store
      posters, direct mail postcards, and digital space advertising.

      Respondents to advertisements will either call the study phone line or visit the study
      website for prescreening and scheduling of an in-person enrollment visit at a local
      participating research site.

      During the face-to-face enrollment visit, potential subjects who meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria for the study will be given an (empty) study medication package and will
      be allowed as much time as they need to review the information on the outside of the entire
      package. Subjects will then be asked if the product is OK or not OK for them to use.

      Qualified subjects then will be allowed to obtain (pharmacy sites) or be given (clinic sites)
      the study product.

      Approximately 35 sites will be used, comprising retail pharmacy research sites and women's
      health clinics or adolescents' clinics.
