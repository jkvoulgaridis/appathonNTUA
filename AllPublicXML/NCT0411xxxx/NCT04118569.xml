  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disparities in palliative care for patients with serious illness exist because of gaps in
      knowledge around patient centered psychological, social, and spiritual palliative care
      interventions. Patient-centered palliative care communication interventions must be informed
      by the perspectives of patients who are living each day with their serious illness. Yet,
      there is a lack of research about how to efficiently and effectively integrate the patient's
      narrative into the electronic health record (EHR). The central hypothesis of this proposal is
      that the implementation of a patient-centered narrative intervention with patients with
      serious illness will result in improved patient-nurse communication and improved patient
      psychosocial and spiritual well-being.

      The overall goal during this study will be to conduct a small scale pilot study with 80
      hospitalized patients and 80 acute care nurses. Specific Aim 1 will establish acceptability,
      feasibility, and potential effect size of the patient-centered narrative intervention for
      hospitalized patients with serious illness. For specific aim 2, the investigators will
      compare the effects of the narrative intervention to usual care for the primary outcome of
      patient's perception of quality of communication and patient's psychosocial and spiritual
      well-being. For specific aim 3, the investigators will conduct usability testing, applying a
      user-task-system-environment evaluation process to determine essential requirements for
      integration and use of the patient-centered story into the EHR, from the perspective of an
      important end user: the acute-care bedside nurse. These results will support future R01
      applications for testing/tailoring patient-centered narrative interventions to improve QoL
      for patients living with serious illness.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Communication: QOC survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 1= Baseline, Time 2= 24-48 hours after baseline, Time 3- 24-48 hours after Time 2</time_frame>
    <description>The QOC survey assesses patients' perceptions of the quality of communication with nurses. The QOC was initially developed from qualitative interviews and focus groups with diverse set of patients, families and providers. The QOC has 19 items, with scores ranging from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the QOC has been established across several illness groups, and the QOC survey's responsiveness to communication interventions has been demonstrated by changes in pre- and post-intervention scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)- 29 Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 1= Baseline, Time 2= 24-48 hours after baseline, Time 3- 24-48 hours after Time 2</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS- 29 profile v2.0 form (29 items), which assesses physiological, social, and psychological outcomes. These biopsychosocial domains include physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep, ability to participate in social roles/activities, pain interference and intensity. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale. There is also one 11-point rating scale for pain intensity. High scores represent more of the domain being measured. Thus, on symptomoriented domains of PROMIS-29 (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and sleep disturbance), higher scores represent worse symptomatology. On the functionoriented domains (physical functioning and social role) higher scores represent better functioning. For example, a high sleep disturbance score indicates high levels of sleep disturbance; a high physical functioning score indicates better physical function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information-System (PROMIS)- Psychosocial Illness Impact</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 1= Baseline, Time 2= 24-48 hours after baseline, Time 3- 24-48 hours after Time 2</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS positive item bank measure (8 items) assesses positive psychosocial outcomes of illness.The PROMIS negative item bank measure (8 items) assesses the direct negative psychosocial effect of illness, distinct from general emotional distress. The item bank instructs participants to think about how their illness has affected them. The item bank uses the time frames: before your illness&quot; and &quot;since your illness&quot;. For adults, each question has five response options ranging in value from two to five. To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question, range 16-40. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Psychosocial Illness Impact-Positive, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average. By comparison, a Psychosocial Illness Impact-Positive T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>
