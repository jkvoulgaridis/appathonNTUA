  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of cannabinoid levels in blood on inflammation and insulin
      sensitivity both acutely and chronically in individuals across the weight spectrum. To that
      end, the study employs two observational designs: 1) A study of acute effects with
      intermittent cannabis users and 2) A study in which current cannabis users will select one of
      three cannabis strains for four weeks and are compared to a matched control group who do not
      use cannabis to study chronic effects. Blood levels of THC and CBD, inflammatory biomarkers,
      and insulin resistance will be measured in both studies.

    <textblock>
      According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, over 30
      million people in the US have diabetes, and just over 84 million people have pre-diabetes.
      Concurrently, 30 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical
      and/or recreational use and over the past decade, cannabis use among adults has more than
      doubled.

      Public perception and some scientific data suggest that cannabis causes acute over-eating,
      creating concern that public and legal acceptance of cannabis use will worsen the obesity
      epidemic in the United States, where more than two-thirds of US adults (68.8%) are currently
      overweight or obese. Paradoxically, cross sectional data demonstrate associations between
      chronic cannabis use and lower body mass index (BMI), prevalence of obesity, insulin
      resistance, waist circumference, and actual rates of type 2 diabetes despite data supporting
      higher caloric intake acutely.

      This study examines the effects of cannabinoid levels in blood on inflammation and insulin
      sensitivity both acutely and chronically in individuals across the weight spectrum. To that
      end, the study employs two observational designs: 1) A study of acute effects with
      intermittent cannabis users and 2) A study in which current cannabis users will select one of
      three cannabis strains for four weeks and are compared to a matched control group who do not
      use cannabis to study chronic effects.
