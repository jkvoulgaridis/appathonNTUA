  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although exposure to nature has restorative effects on human health, beneficial effects of
      nature-based interventions in the working environment have been underexplored. The
      investigators aim to conduct a randomised controlled pilot study.

      During workhours one group participates in a nature-based program, the other group is a
      control group. The investigators test stress-related parameters including cortisol levels,
      wellbeing and stress, and neurocognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants of the intervention group follow a 30-minute stress management course in nature
      followed by a nature-based activity of 1.5 hours, twice a week for 3 consecutive weeks. The
      investigators measure neurocognition via neurocognitive tests, emotional status via burnout
      assessment tool and well-being questionnaires, and asses stress levels via salivary cortisol
      and smartwatches.
