      This randomized control trial will investigate whether using yoga as physical activity
      improves quality of life, self-efficacy for physical activity, reactive balance, and dual
      tasking more than education, journaling, and meditation alone in people with Multiple
      Sclerosis.

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation
      specifically targeting the central nervous system. 1 It is associated with destruction of the
      surrounding myelin sheaths leading to formation of plaques/lesions dispersed throughout the
      brain and spinal cord. 1 The prevalence of MS is nearly one million in the United States with
      the majority of diagnoses occurring between the ages of 20 and 50. 2 Though the precise
      etiology remains unknown, genetic and environmental factors have been linked to the cause and
      therefore MS is considered a multifactorial disease. 3 Hallmark signs of MS include
      progressive demyelination, oligodendrocyte damage, and ultimately axonal destruction. These
      adaptations occur due to an inflammatory response consisting of macrophages, microglia, T and
      B Cells, followed by an intense astrocyte reaction leading to glial scarring, a common
      characteristic of chronic MS lesions. 4 According to Lassmann 1, clinical deficits seen
      throughout the course of MS are more closely correlated to the degree of axonal loss as
      opposed to the amount of lesions or extent of demyelination. These include deficits in
      cognition, vision, bowel and bladder control, coordination, and loss of muscle strength. 5
      Multiple Sclerosis has various subtypes making the clinical course heterogeneous among
      patients. 6 Subtypes include: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing remitting MS
      (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). 6 The variability
      of disease course for each individual subtype is extremely important, and should be taken
      into consideration for prognosis and intervention options. 3

      Due to the aggressive, progressive, unpredictable nature of MS, lack of evidence for a cure,
      and the wide array of cognitive and physical symptoms, MS can detrimentally impact a
      patient's health and reduce overall quality of life. 7 Current research advocates for
      physical activity (PA) as an intervention to combat these effects. Physical activity is
      referred to here as low to moderate level exercise. 8 Some individuals with MS who
      incorporated long-term physical activity into their life demonstrated a decrease in the
      progression of the disease and a reduction in MS flare-ups. 9 In order to successfully
      implement PA based interventions for the management of MS one must first identify individual
      motivators for PA. 5 Motivators for physical activity include self-efficacy and internalized
      motivation which are derived from physical activity outcomes. 5Self-efficacy is &quot;the belief
      that one can successfully cope with challenging conditions&quot; 7 whereas self -determination
      refers to the origin of one's motivation. 8 Other researchers found that &quot;those with MS who
      were more physically active had greater self-efficacy for function and control, and
      self-efficacy for function and control were associated with greater physical and
      psychological components of quality of life.&quot; 7 However, the vast majority of those diagnosed
      with MS avoid exerting themselves due to symptoms of muscle weakness and fatigue; this lack
      of PA is thought to exacerbate those symptoms which then leads to a perpetual cycle of
      inactivity and flare-ups. 8,9 Therefore, it has also been theorized that a program designed
      for MS patients which focuses on promoting self-efficacy could lead to long-term PA
      participation and thus result in increased quality of life. 8

      One such form of physical activity that could provide physiological and psychological
      benefits for individuals diagnosed with MS is yoga. &quot;Yoga is an ancient Indian, non-religious
      mind- body approach that has components centering on meditation, mindfulness, breathing, and
      activity or postures.&quot; 10 Exercise programs which involve these components have been found to
      improve the quality of life by addressing the biopsychosocial (BPS) model. The BPS model is
      composed of biological, psychological and social components which has been found to have a
      positive impact on an individual's health. 11 Therefore, it is hypothesized that by
      increasing muscular strength and flexibility while decreasing affective factors such as
      depression, stress and anxiety and improving social factors will improve an individual's
      overall well-being and allow them to cope with the symptoms associated with MS. 11,12
      Numerous studies have found yoga to be beneficial in improving fatigue and other symptoms
      associated with MS. 13 For example, standing yoga poses can promote improved reactive balance
      through the use of stepping strategies. Yoga also has the potential to reduce cognitive and
      motor costs for individuals during dual tasks resulting in decreased interference and thus
      optimal functioning in more challenging conditions. 14 Previous research has demonstrated
      that yoga significantly improved &quot;physical performance and mental function&quot; and factors
      associated with quality of life in subjects with MS.15 Based on these findings, the
      investigators hypothesize that yoga will improve quality of life and self-efficacy for
      physical activity in people living with MS.

    <time_frame>Pre and post intervention (Week 1 of protocol and week 7 of protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will each complete the Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (MiniBEST).
This assessment is a series of 14 tests measuring anticipatory balance, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait. 16 The 14 tests will be analyzed together to determine reactive and anticipatory balance, as well as, dual task capabilities. Subjects will be tested with flat-heeled shoes or with shoes and socks off. 16 Each of the 14 items are scored on an ordinal scale from 0-2 with a total of 28 points possible. Higher scores indicate higher levels of function, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 2 indicating the highest level of function. Two of the 14 items (Item 3 and Item 6) have right and left assessments in which the lower of the two sides is calculated into the total. If an assistive device is used during an item the score is lowered by one point. If the participant requires physical assistance then the item is automatically scored a 0. 16</description>

    <description>The Marcus Self Efficacy Scale is a survey which will be used to measure participants' beliefs about their ability to exercise. 23 This scale consists of five items that resemble barriers to exercise such as planning time, environmental factors, and physical or emotional well-being. 23 For each scenario, participants rate their confidence on an 11-point Likert scale; 0 is 'does not apply to me,' 1 is 'not at all confident' and 11 is 'very confident.' 23 Lower scores indicate lower self-efficacy and suggest less inclination to participate in exercise. According to Marcus et al, this scale scored a test-retest reliability of r=.90 over a two-week period.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Scale (Change is being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post intervention(Week 1 of protocol and week 7 of protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life (QoL) survey consists of 32 items created by Gill et al. 24 This survey allows the participant to evaluate their quality of life based on the biopsychosocial model. The participants are asked to circle a number from 1 'poor' to 5 'excellent' based on their perception of their quality of life. Gill et al 24 recommended the QoL survey as a valuable tool in research based on its psychometric properties. Gill et al 25 re-evaluated the QoL survey for test-retest reliability and compared to other quality of life measurements. Gill et al 24 reported reliability of .793 for ADL and .950 for spirituality. In addition, the QoL survey demonstrated good test-retest reliability ranging from .677 to .816, and intraclass correlations from .676 to .809. 25</description>

    <time_frame>Pre and post intervention (Week 1 of protocol and week 7 of protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) will be completed by participants in order to determine their level of disability based on their method of ambulation. 26 This outcome measure is based on the Disease Steps scale created by Hohol et al 27 which sought to provide neurologists with a simple guide for therapeutic intervention and to assess patient progress. The PDDS consists of nine ordinal rankings from 0 (normal) to 8 (bedridden). The PDDS has a strong correlation with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) which is the most widely accepted measure for MS disability; this confirms criterion validity. 26 According to Learmonth et al 26 the PDDS is a valid and useful patient-reported score system for assessing disability in individuals with MS.</description>

    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (Change is being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post intervention (Week 1 of protocol and week 7 of protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a self-reported survey which will be used to determine the impact of fatigue on an individual over the last four weeks. 28 This consists of twenty-one items rated on a 5-point Likert scale with 0 being 'never' and 4 being 'almost always'. Scores can be subdivided into physical, psychosocial, and cognitive subscales. Total scores range from 0-84 with higher scores indicating greater fatigue and MS related fatigue is identified as a score of 38 or greater. 28 The minimal clinically important change for the MFIS is 16 points short-term and 20 points long-term. 28 Learmonth et al 28 found the MFIS has an excellent test-retest reliability of 0.837 over a 6-month period. In addition, Amtmann et al 29 found that the MFIS has excellent internal consistency, demonstrated by a Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.93, and known groups validity.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Change is being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post intervention (Week 1 of protocol and week 7 of protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19 item self-rated questionnaire that will be completed by the participants. The PSQI will serve as a subjective measure of sleep for participants participating in the study, and allow for discrimination between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; sleepers. 30 The 19 individual items assessed help to generate seven component, consisting of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. 30 A global score is obtained from the seven components, ranging from 0-21, with higher scores reflecting poor sleep quality. 31 While the PSQI has not been specifically validated in people diagnosed with MS, it has been used to assess changes in sleep patterns in those diagnosed with MS in many different studies. 30,31</description>

    <measure>Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (Change is being assessed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post intervention (Week 1 of protocol and week 7 of protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin is a 3-question, self-report measure that assesses the frequency that individuals engage in bouts of PA at light, moderate, and strenuous levels. 34 The measure asks frequency of PA at each activity level and uses a formula to calculate a score (MET value) for weekly activity (9 x strenuous, 5 x moderate, and 3 x light). The higher the overall score, the greater the PA level. The MET scores can also be used to classify PA participation into three categories: &quot;active&quot; (24 and higher), &quot;moderately active&quot; (14-23), and &quot;insufficiently active&quot; (less than 14). More recently, research has proposed using only using the moderate and strenuous calculations to classify individuals as &quot;active&quot; (? 24 METS) and insufficiently active&quot; (? 23 METS) to fall in line with PA guidelines in both the United States and Canada. 35-36 It has been used extensively with the MS population. 38</description>

    <description>The Bladder Control Scale (BLCS) is a survey consisting of four items that briefly assess bladder. control and the impact it has on the individual's quality of life. This survey was developed by Turnbull et al (1992) and is cited by the National Multiple Sclerosis user's manual and Beadnall et al. 32 The BLCS has a scoring system ranging from 0-22 with higher scores indicating more difficulty with bladder control. 32, 33 MS specialists were consulted during the development of this scale to ensure content validity. Beadnall et al 32 noted multiple studies showing the BLCS to be valid and having good reliability.</description>

    <ipd_description>Participants will be de-identified using a number system to ensure the privacy of the individual's health data. Hard copy data will be double-locked in a secure location at Winston Salem State University. Electronic data will be stored on a password protected computer. Data collected will only be accessible to the principal and supplementary investigators. Data will be saved for a minimum of three years. Individuals who will have access to de-identified data will include the principal investigator, co-investigators (Dr Fasczewski and Dr Migliarese), and student physical therapists who are functioning in a graduate assistant role during the study. Additionally, we plan to submit for a clinical trial registry number. No other individuals will have access to individual data.</ipd_description>
