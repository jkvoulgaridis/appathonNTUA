      1. To describe the patterns of care of newly diagnosed patients with NVAF vs VAF in the
           first-line, second-line and beyond second line setting, including, treatment plan,
           regimen, dosing, duration of treatment, and reason for interruption and termination
           along with treatment switching at any point of treatment, regardless if the patients are
           considered of first line, second line or further within the treatments.

        2. To describe the clinical outcomes (stroke/systemic embolism, bleeding complications, as
           well as cause-specific and all-cause mortality) with NVAF vs VAF.

        3. To describe the values and distribution of International normalized ratio (INR) in
           patients who received VKAs and to assess the influence of Time in therapeutic range
           (TTR) and INR history on clinical outcomes (stroke/systemic embolism, bleeding
           complications) with NVAF vs VAF.

        4. To evaluate AF-related healthcare resource utilization and direct costs associated with
           the management of AF patients with NVAF vs VAF.

      and To describe the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics as well as risk factors
      among patients newly diagnosed with NVAF versus VAF.

        This is a prospective observational study to be carried out in Assiut University Heart
        Hospital.

        The study is designed to capture real-world evidence (RWE) on patients' characteristics and
        the clinical management of patients with with NVAF vs VAF. All consecutive patients that
        are newly diagnosed with NVAF within the recruitment period (estimated to be 6 months) and
        90 days before baseline visit and who meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
        invited to participate in the study. The study periods may be revised based on recruitment
        rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. All male or female patients aged 18 years and older at the date of inclusion.

             2. Patient newly diagnosed [within the recruitment period (estimated to be 6 months)
             and 90 days before the baseline visit] with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for whom
             treatment has started by the caring physician for the prevention of stroke/systemic
             embolism.

             3. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  2. Severe psychiatric illness or other disease or circumstances that could compromise
             participation in the study. Patients will not be enrolled if major difficulties with
             follow-up will be anticipated, for example, patients with no valid residency permit or
             those planning to leave the country before the next scheduled follow-up.

             3. Current participation in an interventional clinical trial at baseline. 4. AF with a
             generally reversible cause defined as non-cardiac surgery, post-cardiac surgery (AF
             within 3 months after surgery), hyperthyroidism, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and
             acute myocardial infarction.

             5. Mechanical heart valves or valve disease expected to require valve replacement.

             6. A medical condition other than AF for which chronic use of VKA/NOAC is indicated.

             7. Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Pregnancy to be ruled out according normal
             practice method of each site.
