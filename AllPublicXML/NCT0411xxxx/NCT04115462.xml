  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In This experiment, the investigators would like to test the two following hypotheses
      regarding the mechanisms by which opioids cause itch:

        1. Opioids cause itch by a spinal disinhibition mechanism (central nervous system (CNS)
           effect).

        2. Opioids cause itch through a mast cell-destabilizing effect leading to release of
           histamine and tryptase in the skin where itch is evoked (peripheral mechanism).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrathecal and orally administered opioids are heavily used for the treatment of several
      acute pain conditions. However, while opioids are effective analgesics for acute pain, they
      are well-known to frequently cause itch (pruritus) as a side effect according with the two
      hypotheses stated above. So far, these two hypotheses have never been tested in humans.The
      present study describes a proposed study design for the purpose of confirming these two
      hypotheses in parallel in human subjects.

      Primary endpoints of the study:

      To evaluate changes itch and pain perception, and superficial perfusion after each itch
      provocations.

      Secondary endpoints of the study:

      To evaluate the existence of a correlation between itch sensitization and analgesic efficacy.
