    <description>Each of the 6 weekly 1-hour sessions begins with a voluntary commitment to actively participate and to try something new in the upcoming week; includes a section devoted to selecting and publicly committing to one change focused on reducing negative/increasing positive cognitions and one change focused on increasing pleasant activities; and ends with home practice assignments. Additional exercises designed to increase dissonance induction include (a) group discussions for changing conditions, (b) roleplays to generate quick comebacks to written negative thoughts provided by other group members, (c) in-session writing exercises on the benefits of doing fun activities, (d) discussion of methods for creating internal and external accountability for positive change, (e) home practice assignment of engaging in actions to help someone else' mood, (f) writing a letter to my future self about positive intentions, and (g) providing positive feedback to other group members at the last session.</description>

    <description>The 6 weekly 1-hour sessions begin with a review of concepts and (after Session 1) review of past home practice assignments; all sessions conclude with home practice assignments. Each session has a portion devoted to thought identification/recording and cognitive restructuring and a portion devoted to increased involvement in pleasant activities. We use motivational enhancement exercises to maximize willingness to use the new skills, behavioral techniques to reinforce use of the new skills, and group activities to foster feelings of group cohesion.</description>

    <description>College students with depressive symptoms will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) a cognitive behavioral prevention intervention, 2) a cognitive behavioral prevention intervention with counter-attitudinal elements or 3) an educational brochure control. We will test if the additional of counter attitudinal elements produces intervention effects when delivered to participants with sub threshold depressive symptoms.</description>
