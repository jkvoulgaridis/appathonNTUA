  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this proposed physical activity (PA) intervention is to develop a
      realistic and an economical intervention to promote regular PA among older, overweight or
      obese Black women. Physical inactivity is prevalent among older Black women and this
      lifestyle behavior is both a destructive and expensive public health issue. Because many in
      this population do not engage in sufficient amounts of regular PA, this group miss the
      cardio-protective effects that may reduce many chronic conditions that disproportionately
      affect Blacks such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The proposed obesity-reduction
      intervention is aligned with Stage 1 of the National Institute on Aging Stage Model for
      Behaviors Interventions Development. For the proposed hypothesis, the investigators propose a
      2-group randomized controlled pilot, feasibility study in which 30 women will be randomized
      to receive either the TOSS PA Text messages Plus Fitbit community or the Control group and
      followed for 12 weeks to detect intervention effect.

    <description>Older overweight or obese Black women who participate in the physical activity intervention group will receive a daily text message from the TOSS study for 12 weeks, a Fitbit device plus have access to the Fitbit community option on their Fitbit app as an opportunity for virtual peer support. They will also receive an instruction pamphlet that describes the health benefits of regular physical activity (PA), safety instructions for PA, the national PA guidelines for older adults, suggested strategies to increase number of steps and an accelerometer pre and post-intervention.</description>
