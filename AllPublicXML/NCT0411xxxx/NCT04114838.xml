  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular
      events. The critical ischemia stage represents the most severe stage of Peripheral Arterial
      Occlusive Disease, associated with decubitus pain and / or foot ulceration. The severity of
      this arterial involvement involves functional prognosis of the lower limb with a high risk of
      amputation, and the vital prognosis of the patient. In these patients, the rate of amputation
      and mortality at 1 year can reach 20%. Therefore, the goal of management in a
      multidisciplinary setting is limb salvage and improvement of the patient's vital prognosis.

      In the vascular medicine department, the indication and modalities of the revascularization
      procedure are discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting. Surgical
      revascularization by distal bypass requires venous material that can be used, a receiving
      artery without diffuse lesions, in direct continuity with the arterial network of the foot,
      and the absence of co-morbidities against general anesthesia. With the modernization and
      development of endovascular equipment dedicated to the hamstrings, the interventional
      radiology techniques in the management of critical ischemia allow the treatment of one or
      more arterial axes as well as a very distal revascularization in the arteries. of the foot
      with less morbidity-mortality compared to surgery, especially in patients the most fragile
      patients. Since 2013, the endovascular revascularization procedures performed by the
      interventional radiology team have been an integral part of the management of patients with
      peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs monitored in the vascular medicine department.
      The hospital is therefore a privileged place to observe the long-term impact of this medical
      care on the future of patients with different stages of severity of arterial disease.

      The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the life-threatening, limb salvage
      and associated prognostic factors in patients with Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease
      supported by endovascular revascularization in the vascular medicine department of the GHPSJ.
