  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new technique that may, in the future, help deliver
      medications to the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease. Participants in this study will
      undergo a focused ultrasound treatment to the brain, along with Magnetic Resonance Imagine
      (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system disorders are currently being symptomatically treated since the
      molecular events provoking their onset have not been yet identified. Drug delivery techniques
      have to overcome the almost impermeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and can be grouped into two
      main categories: (i) invasive and targeted, and (ii) non-invasive and non-targeted methods.
      However, the technological advances of the past decades revealed the immense potential of
      focused ultrasound (FUS) in transcranial applications. In contrast to other techniques,
      FUS-mediated BBB opening is both non-invasive and targeted. The localized energy delivery
      coupled with the circulation of intravenously administered microbubbles initiates biological
      effects confined only to the vessel walls and contained only in the targeted region within
      the brain.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of focused
      ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening in Alzheimer's disease patients, using a
      single-element transducer with neuronavigation guidance. The investigators will also test
      whether treatment with focused ultrasound alone alters the amyloid protein levels in the
      treated brain areas and its potential effects on the cognitive function of Alzheimer's
      patients.

    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of individuals with successful opening of the BBB will be assessed. Blood-brain barrier opening volume will be measured in mm^3 through contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI on the day of the focused ultrasound treatment and 3 days after treatment, to confirm blood-brain barrier restoration.</description>

    <measure>Total number of Safety Events Related to Opening of BBB</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of safety events related to opening of the BBB as assessed by T2 and susceptibility-weighted (SWI) MRI. Safety will be established by the presence and the total area of hyper-intense or hypo-intense areas in the T2 and SWI scans.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Amyloid PET Signal Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through 3 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Amyloid plaques will be assessed through PET imaging before and after the focused ultrasound treatment. The standardized uptake value ratio images (SUVr) will be compared before and after the FUS treatment, to investigate if there is a change in the uptake of 18F-Florbetapir within the treated area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through 3 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a 30-point questionnaire that is used to measure cognitive impairment. MMSE scores range from 0 (worst outcome)-30 (better outcome). Cognitive function will be assessed before and after the focused ultrasound treatment to determine a the change in MMSE.</description>
