  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect parallel intracardiac signal data during pre-defined
      periods of clinical interest from the PURE EP system and the existing signal recording and
      mapping systems.

      The collected signals will then undergo BLINDED, CONTROLLED evaluation by unbiased
      electrophysiologist reviewer(s) to determine whether the PURE EP signals provides additional
      or clearer diagnostic information.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac electrophysiologists rely on the display of electrograms when performing
      electrophysiology (EP) studies and catheter ablations in patients with arrhythmias. To
      achieve effective outcomes without complications, it is vital that the recording system
      enables the recognition of clearly abnormal (scared myocardium) and normal electrical
      signals.

      Current recording systems have limitations in that it can be difficult to clearly distinguish
      a true cardiac signal from noise or artifact. This is particularly true when pacing the heart
      and when ablating abnormal myocardial tissue, components of the conduction system or
      epicardial structures. Therefore, improvement of the fidelity of signals obtained from EP
      recording systems is needed to enhance identification of the most effective targets for
      ablation.

      There are several standard electrophysiology recording systems in use today, such as the
      commonly used GE/Prucka CardioLab recording system (&quot;Prucka&quot;) which would benefit from
      additional features in order to improve the ability to record, discriminate and analyze
      signals from the heart. BioSig Technologies, Inc. (&quot;BioSig&quot;) has developed an
      electrophysiology signal processing system, the PURE EP™ System, which may allow
      electrophysiologists to better characterize arrhythmogenic tissue during ablation procedures.
      Specifically, the PURE EP™ System's higher sampling rate and higher dynamic range allow
      improved visualization of low amplitude signals, especially those temporally situated near
      low frequency, high amplitude signals or large high-frequency signals.

      This multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, observational study will involve at least
      five patients undergoing elective cardiac ablation procedure for tachycardias such as atrial
      fibrillation, atypical atrial flutter, ischemic ventricular tachycardia, or symptomatic
      premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The existing recording/mapping system clocks will
      be synchronized to the PURE EP clock prior to each procedure. At the beginning of the
      procedures, all systems will be optimized for best signal display based on the physician
      preference. During the ablation procedures, annotations will be captured on the PURE EP
      system based on pre-determined clinically relevant events defined in this protocol (example -
      before and after successful ablation therapy).

      After the procedures, parallel signal data samples will be harvested from all the systems
      using the procedure annotations and the time stamps as a guide. Once the signal data is
      harvested, cleaned, and organized, the individual signal samples will be reviewed in a
      blinded, controlled fashion by a group of independent, unbiased electrophysiologist(s).

      Selected signal sample sets (from the same date and time stamp) will be separated in the
      survey and arranged in random order. The reviewer will be asked specific and identical
      questions relevant to each set of signal samples, but the individual samples will be
      separated and randomized across a full survey containing many different signal samples from
      many different procedures. The signal survey will be created under the direction of the
      Principle Investigator. The selection of the independent EP reviewers will also be done under
      the direction of the Principle Investigator

    <measure>Safe and effective use of the PURE EP 2 system based on system specifications and recorded within the Case Report Form (CRF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the cardiac ablation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this study is to further establish the safe and effective use of the PURE EP System during cardiac ablation in the EP Laboratory in a post-market environment. The PURE EP System will be installed to run in parallel to existing mapping and recording systems already in use in the EP lab. Each system will be optimized for viewing intracardiac signals based on the physician preference. The existing systems will serve as the primary method of viewing intracardiac signals and the PURE EP system will be redundant.
The intracardiac signals from the PURE EP system will be compared to existing recording and mapping system signals generated in real-time during each ablation procedure. The PURE EP system signals will be monitored by the physician investigator and a company clinical representative to validate the PURE EP 2 system runs as intended based on the system manual and meets expected standards for displaying signals.</description>

    <description>The secondary aim of this study is to assess the quality of the PURE EP intracardiac signals and the associated clinical relevance of the signals when compared to other sources of intracardiac signals. During the ablation procedures, annotations will be captured on the PURE EP system based on clinically relevant events defined in the protocol.
After the procedure, parallel signal data samples will be harvested from all the systems using annotations and the time stamps as a guide. Once the signal data is harvested and organized, the signal samples across multiple procedures will be reviewed in a blinded, controlled fashion by 2-3 independent, unbiased expert electrophysiologist(s).
The sample survey will be created under the direction of the PI.</description>
