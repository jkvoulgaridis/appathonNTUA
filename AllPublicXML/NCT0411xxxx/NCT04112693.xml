    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized on high-resolution
      manometry (HRM) studies by 100% failed peristalsis and elevated integrated relaxation
      pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter. It is further divided into 3 sub-types according
      to the Chicago classification v3.01. The pathophysiology of achalasia is poorly understood;
      however, the NGEU is increasingly recognized as playing a key role in the development of this
      disorder. Similarly, the esophageal muscle tissue is probably involved, but its sampling
      remained challenging until the recent advent of the POEM procedure. Indeed, it is now
      possible, easy and safe to take biopsies of the muscle tissue during POEM. Therefore, POEM
      not only represents an innovative and effective treatment for achalasia, but also an
      opportunity to better understand its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Currently
      available treatments for achalasia (pneumatic dilation (PD), Heller's myotomy (HM), botox
      injections, POEM) are &quot;palliative&quot; procedures that do not restore normal contractile function
      of the esophagus, but a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
      this disorder could potentially help developing curative, or even preventative treatments.

      To date, muscle tissue sampled during a POEM has only been characterized qualitatively
      (normal, atrophic, hypertrophic) with no assessment of the enteric nervous system. Moreover,
      there has been no studies of the mucosal or NGEU anomalies on biopsies taken during a
      minimally invasive procedure for achalasia such as a POEM.

      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the assessment of NGEU and esophageal muscle
      tissue in biopsies taken during a POEM for achalasia. It also aims to determine whether
      specific biomarkers within the NGEU and muscle tissue can predict a better therapeutic
      response to a POEM. The goal is to include 30 patients within 12 months. Given that
      approximately 100 new cases of achalasia are diagnosed each year at the included centers, and
      that about 50% of treatment-naive patients are offered and accept to undergo a POEM,
      recruitment should be completed relatively rapidly. All POEMs will be performed at the CHU de
      Nantes by a single endoscopist who has already performed more than 100 procedures. Other than
      the complications related to the POEM itself, the addition of 14 esophageal biopsies required
      for our study is a very low-risk intervention. Biopsy sampling extends the length of the
      procedure by only 4-5 minutes and has not been associated with an increased risk of
      complications in a previous study.

      Patients will be evaluated at five time points: preinclusion visit (up to four months before
      the POEM), inclusion visit (day of the POEM), post-POEM phone calls (3-6, 9-12, 22-26 months
      after POEM). During the preinclusion visit, relevant information regarding
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, consent, HRM and pH impedance results, past medical history,
      and pregnancy status (if applicable) will be gathered. At each time point, current medical
      history, Eckhardt score2 and pH impedance results (if available) will be documented. The
      patient will also answer the quality of life (SF36)3 and nutritional status questionnaires
      and will undergo blood sampling for albumin and prealbumin levels. Additionally, on the day
      of the POEM, there will be another blood sampling for complete blood count, PT, APTT, serum
      electrolytes and CRP level. Finally, at each post-POEM phone calls, the occurrence of adverse
      events will be reported.

      Our primary hypothesis is that the analysis of mucosal and muscle tissue biopsies taken
      safely during a POEM will allow better characterization of transcriptomic and molecular
      remodeling of the mucosa (especially the NGEU) and the muscularis propria in achalasia. We
      also hypothesize that these anomalies could eventually serve as treatment targets and as a
      way of better stratifying patients according to achalasia type and treatment (in our case,
      POEM) response.
