  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient's reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is recognized as being of interest
      for post-marketing safety monitoring, but is still underdeveloped in France, with an average
      lower than the European average. A multidisciplinary team of the University Hospital of Caen,
      composed of neurologists and pharmacovigilants, has been carrying out since autumn 2017 a
      national study (VIGIP-SEP1) with 24 research centers in France (12 universitary hospitals, 6
      general hospitals, and 6 private-practice neurologists) whose main objective was to evaluate
      the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients' use of a mobile application (App) to report
      their ADRs. My eReport FranceÂ® has been developed by the eVedrug company: ADR reports are
      sent by patients directly to the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centers, after analyze, clinical
      pharmacologist send it to the National Competent Authority. As part of VIGIP-SEP1, the
      accompaniment for the use of the App was carried out very simply by neurologists.

      We designed a randomized controlled trial based on the assumption that a nurse training of
      the patient, after the initial prescription of an oral MS drug, with a telephone follow-up
      within 6 months, will increase by 3 times the number of patients who report ADRs compared to
      a simple information presented by the neurologist. The number of subjects required is 23
      subjects per group.
