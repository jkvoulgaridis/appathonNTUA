  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial, in parallel with cross-control design. Two groups of healthy
      subjects will be randomly selected to transcranial stimulation group or suboccipital
      stimulation group. Each group receive in a randomized order a real direct current session and
      a sham session. The study is based on the hypothesis that the application of direct current
      sitmulation applied at the suboccipital level produce higher modifications on endogenous pain
      modulation system than transcranial stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of the project will be based on the Declarations of the World Medical
      Association of Helsinki. Every subject will be informed about the nature of the study,
      willingness to participate, the proposed objectives, as well as possible adverse effects that
      may occur in its implementation. Every subject will be asked to give their signed consent to
      participate in the study. The study will be suspended at any time, if the patient wishes.

      Healthy volunteers will be recruited from the city of Toledo, between the ages of 18 and 40.
      The detection and selection of the sample will be carried out between the students of the
      University of Castilla-La Mancha and personnel of the Hospital Nacional de Parapléjicos who
      meet the inclusion criteria and give their consent voluntarily to participate in the study.

      The calculation of the sample size will be carried out using the G * Power software program
      (version 3.1), for clinical studies with two intervention groups. Conditioned pain modulation
      will be chosen as the primary outcome variable. Assuming an α level of 0.05 and a statistical
      power of 85%, with a moderate effect size for the ANOVA test (0.25).

      The experiment will be carried out in the clinical laboratory of the Sensory-Motor Function
      Research Group of the Hospital Nacional de Parapléjicos. Under attenuated sound conditions,
      and at a stable temperature in the range of (22 °C-26 °C).

      In the first session of the study, a small interview will be carried out to determine if
      there is any exclusion criterion. The initial measurements will consist of sociodemographic
      variables and psychological variables, which will then be used to categorize groups and
      analyze covariates. A parallel randomized controlled trial with cross-control design is
      proposed. Two groups of healthy subjects will be randomly selected to transcranial direct
      current stimulation (DCS) group or suboccipital DCS group. Each group receive in a randomized
      order and with a double blind design a real direct current session and a sham session. An
      assessment is made before and after each intervention.

      Subjects will remain in a sitting position, with their backs resting in a relaxed position.
      In all interventions a direct current stimulator (DC-stimulator, Neuroconn) will be used.

    <masking_description>Blinding of the assessor: all the assessments will be made by a different researcher who apply all the interventions. Assessor will not have vision of the place where the electrodes are located neither the parameters used.
Blinding of the subjects: Although subjects will be blinded to the hypothesis of the study, the transcranial and suboccipital location of the electrodes cannot be blinded. Direct current and sham stimulation will be blinded. For the sham condition subjects will feel the stimulation sensation for 30 seconds and then the stimulator will turn off. The same equipment, identical electrodes, and cables will be used. In addition, subjects will not have a view of the computer screen.
Blinding of the person who apply the intervention: Although transcranial and suboccipital conditions cannot be blinded. The direct current and sham stimulation will be apply by the blind-mode of the stimulator using locking codes.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline at 0 min</time_frame>
    <description>For this protocol the test stimulus (TS) and the conditioning stimulus (CS) will be applied sequentially (first CS, followed by TS), heterotopic, and contralateral. The CS temperature will be 12 °C on the cold pressor test to induce a perception of pain. The subjects will have to submerge the non-dominant hand in the cold water bath for 30s, and evaluate the CS-induced pain intensity at 10, 20, and 30s (t1, t2 and t3 respectively). After assessing CS-induced pain intensity at the 30s of immersion participants will withdraw their hand from the water bath, and will have to fix their attention to the dominant hand where TS was immediately applied. The TS-induced pain assessment at 10, 20, and 30s (t1, t2 and t3).</description>

    <time_frame>At 5 min</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of the habituation and temporal summation of pain, heat stimuli of a &quot;p-3&quot; intensity without conditioning stimulus (CS) will be applied. The tonic heat stimulus will be applied on the surface of the tenar eminence of the dominant hand by 8 consecutive stimuli separated from each other by 1.5 seconds, evaluating the pain perceived during the first and the eighth stimulus, and at 15 seconds after the stimulation. The temperature will be determined individually, in order to reflect the general level of discomfort that the stimulus could produce according to the visual analog scale (0-10).</description>

    <measure>Baseline Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>at 10 min</time_frame>
    <description>To record the mechanical pain threshold, a point will be marked on the Tibialis Anterior muscle and on the dorsal surface of the right hand, specifically on the second metacarpal lateral border, approximately 3 cm proximal to the interdigital fold. This zone is especially sensitive to pressure. For registration, the digital algometer with 0.1 N increment scale (Wagner Instruments brand, model FDIX), with a circular applicator of 1 cm in diameter will be used. Once the applicator is placed perpendicular to the skin, the pressure will increase at a rate of approximately 5 N / s. Three measures will be taken with an interval between measures of 10 seconds, the average of the three measurements will be taken as threshold of pain to the pressure.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI-ES)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 min</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the adapted version to the Spanish of the State Scale (STAI-ES) of the &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire&quot; (STAI). The STAI is a well-known scale of self-report, comprising two self-assessment subscales that measure two concepts of anxiety: state (S) and trait (T). It is composed of 40 items with 4 possible answers each (score 0 to 3). The total scores for each of the subscales range from 0 to 60 points. Specifically STAI-ES evaluates the anxiety-state in a great variety of situations.</description>

    <description>Most commonly used questionnaire at the global and national levels to assess depression. We will use the adaptation to the Spanish of the Beck II depression inventory. It consists of 21 items to measure the affective, cognitive situation and the signs and symptoms of depression during the last two weeks. High scores indicate high levels of depressive symptoms. This inventory has demonstrated excellent psychometric properties</description>
