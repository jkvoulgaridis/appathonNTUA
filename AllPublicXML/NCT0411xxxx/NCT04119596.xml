  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A case-control study to identify microbiome and genetic differences between healthy subjects
      and patients with incident Parkinson's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of subjects - one including healthy individuals and the other - treatment-naive
      patients with incident Parkinson's disease - will fill in the food frequency questionnaire,
      SF-36 questionnaire, HADS questionnaire and the physical activity questionnaire. All subjects
      must have 0-3 points on Hoehn and Yahr scale and more than 22 points on MoCA scale. DNA
      microarray genotyping will be used to process the DNA samples of the participants. The data
      on the composition of the participants' gut microbiota will be obtained through 16S rRNA
      sequencing of their stool samples.

    <description>According to SF-36 questionnaire The Medical Outcomes Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) It is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 36-items measuring eight dimensions of general HRQOL: physical functioning (10 items), role limitation due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and general mental health (5 items). In addition to scores for individual dimensions, two summary scores assessing physical and mental dimensions of health and well-being can also be calculated: Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score, respectively</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The aim of this study is to measure patients anxiety and depression, using the HADS : Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale.
Scores of the HADS scale can be defined as:
By adding the points of the answers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13: we obtain the &quot;Total A&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the anxiety, then:
7 or less: absence of symptomatology; 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology; 11 and above: certain symptomatology.
By adding the points of the answers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14: we obtain the &quot;Total B&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the depression, then:
7 or less: absence of symptomatology; 8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology; 11 and above: certain symptomatology. The minimal score is 0 and the maximal total score is 42</description>

    <measure>MOCA scale questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA assesses several cognitive domains:
The short-term memory recall task (5 points) involves two learning trials of five nouns and delayed recall after approximately five minutes.
Visuospatial abilities are assessed using a clock-drawing task (3 points) and a three-dimensional cube copy (1 point).
Multiple aspects of executive functions are assessed using an alternation task adapted from the trail-making B task (1 point), a phonemic fluency task (1 point), and a two-item verbal abstraction task (2 points).
Attention, concentration, and working memory are evaluated using a sustained attention task (target detection using tapping; 1 point), a serial subtraction task (3 points), and digits forward and backward (1 point each).
Language is assessed using a three-item confrontation naming task with low-familiarity animals (lion, camel, rhinoceros; 3 points), repetition of two syntactically complex sentences (2 points), and the aforementioned fluency task.</description>
