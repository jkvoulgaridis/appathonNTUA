    <textblock>
      Main objective: to demonstrate that the diagnostic quality associated with the acquisition
      mode with tin filter, evaluated in a subjective way, is not inferior to that associated with
      the acquisition mode without filter.

      The chest x-ray is the first-line exam for the study of pulmonary parenchyma. Nevertheless,
      it does not make it possible to reveal all pulmonary pathologies, and in particular those of
      very small sizes. Thanks to its very high spatial resolution and contrast resolution, the
      scanner is able to detect all infra-millimetric pathologies of the pulmonary parenchyma but
      also mediastinal pathologies that could not have been seen on the standard x-ray.

      This study fits into the context of pleural pathology screening for patients exposed to
      asbestos in their professional environment.

      Today, the chest CT scan in millimetric sections isth e standardised method used in the
      context of this screening.Tin filtration is an additional filtration at the output of the
      X-ray tube made available on premium Siemens scanners. In diagnostic medical imaging, the
      photon beam has an energetic spectrum ranging from 0 to 150 keV. However the weak energies do
      not participate in the formation of the image but, on the other hand, to the overall
      radiation of the patient. The purpose of the addition of the tin filter is to be able to
      suppress, at the output of the tube, all low and medium energy levels, only allowing high
      energy levels to pass through. A previous study comparing the same group of patients on two
      different machines (one with tin filtration, one without tin filtration) showed a significant
      decrease in the radiation dose; nevertheless, a certain number of parameters differed between
      the two scanners used. In order to get rid of the different biases encountered on previous
      published studies, we propose to carry out this study on the same machine, by activating and
      deactivating tin filtration, all other parameters of acquisition and reconstruction of the
      image being equal in all respects.
