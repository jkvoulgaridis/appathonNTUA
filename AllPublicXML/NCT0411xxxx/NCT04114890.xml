  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be asymptomatic for years but can also lead to chronic hepatitis,
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure and death and cannot be eradicated with the
      current therapy. Chronic maternal HBV infection is an important source of perinatal
      transmission in regions of high HBV prevalence. In antenatal clinics at Shoklo Malaria
      Research Unit (SMRU), the Hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen (sAg) prevalence is 8.3% with a HB
      e-antigen (HBeAg) prevalence of 32.7% in those positive for HBsAg in 2012-2014. Perinatal
      infection occurs in 70-90% of women with HBeAg positive chronic HBV compared with 0-30% in
      those with HBeAg negative chronic HBV (inactive carriers). These infection rates reflect, in
      part, the failure of maternal and child health programs to prevent perinatal transmission
      with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and HB vaccines. Prevention of mother to child
      transmission (PMTCT) fails in an estimated 8-32% of cases with adequate preventive
      techniques. Antiretrovirals, like tenofovir (TFV) that is administered as the prodrug
      Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), are active against HBV and may reduce the risk of HBV
      transmission at birth if offered at the right time in pregnancy.

      One of the major gaps in implementing this strategy is adequate pharmacokinetic (PK) data in
      pregnant women that informs correct dosing. One recently published population PK study in 154
      women who provided maternal blood samples (32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy, at delivery, and at
      1 and 2 months post-partum) reported a tenofovir area under curve (AUC) 0-24 that was
      estimated to be 20% (95% CI, 19-21%) lower during pregnancy than during post-partum
      suggesting no dose adjustments are needed in 3rd trimester. Most PK studies for TDF in
      pregnancy have been for Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections. However,
      these patients often receive additional antiretroviral medications, preventing conclusions on
      PK parameters of Tenofovir (TFV) alone. Doses that are optimal for HIV may not be appropriate
      for HBV.

      When TDF is administered during pregnancy and potentially during lactation, it is important
      to establish the infant drug exposure. Previous human studies have shown that antiretrovirals
      administered to lactating mothers are present in the breast milk and have detected a low TDF
      breast milk concentration representing 0.03% or less of the proposed infant dosage. However,
      there is no data on this subject in therapeutic treatment of HBV infected women. In resource
      poor settings TDF administration will be ceased after 1 month post-partum. While there is
      some understanding of what happens to viral load post cessation in non-pregnant individuals,
      post-partum TDF cessation is less well understood and may be affected by differences in
      immunity. With breastmilk as the primary source of nutrition for babies in resource limited
      settings, it is important to know the viral exposure from breastmilk, if any, as these
      settings may also have problems achieving birth dose, HBIG and completion of the recommended
      three doses of vaccine.

      The investigators propose a dense PK study of once daily TDF 300 mg during pregnancy given
      for PMTCT of HBV mono-infection. Tenofovir PK will be measured in maternal blood samples in
      steady-state, in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and post-partum. The presence of HBV DNA in blood
      and breast milk will also be explored in women after cessation of treatment until 6 months
      post-partum.

      Participants with HBV mono infection and a measurable HBV DNA viral load attending SMRU
      antenatal clinics (ANC) on the Myanmar-Thailand border will be invited if they have a
      gestational age of at least 20 weeks. A total of 24 women: 12 participants enrolled in 2nd
      trimester (EGA 20-&lt;24 weeks) and 12 enrolled in 3rd trimester (EGA 28-&lt;36) with complete
      samples are required.

      Women, identified by routine antenatal care screening for HBV will be invited to participate
      if they are HBsAg positive and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will
      be provided TDF 300mg daily and will continue TDF treatment until one month after delivery.
      The TFV concentrations will be measured monthly before delivery, at delivery, in cord blood
      and 1 and 2 months postpartum. Additional dense PK blood sampling will be done in the second
      and third trimester and postpartum. Breast milk samples timed with mother blood and infant
      blood samples will be included to measure drug concentrations in breastmilk as possible
      presence of HBV DNA viral in breastmilk following cessation of TDF.

      The dense sampling for pharmacokinetics assessments will occur at least after 2 weeks of TDF
      treatment in second trimester between 22-26 weeks gestation, in third trimester between 30-38
      weeks gestation, and 4 weeks postpartum. The dense sampling will entail twelve blood samples
      in a 24 hour period (24ml of blood in total). Women will be counseled about the importance of
      adherence. Direct Observed Treatment (DOT) in the 3 days prior to the dense blood sampling
      will be performed. The woman can choose to be admitted for these days or if a home visitor
      lives close enough be supervised at home.

      The follow-up for women will be until 6 months post-partum, to check for flares. TFV
      concentrations will be collected by venous blood testing but an indwelling catheter can be
      used during the rich sampling 24 hour period. Infants will be followed up from delivery, and
      at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months of age for vaccination and growth. Infant drug exposure is measured
      at month 1 and HBV DNA will be measured at birth from cord blood and HBsAg by venepuncture at
      2 months of age.

      Study duration

      The investigators will enroll volunteers into this study after ethical approval. Because the
      investigators will enroll subjects in gestational windows the investigators expect the
      recruitment and follow up to last at least 2 years.
