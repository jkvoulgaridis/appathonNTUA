      This is a Phase 1b first-in-human trial in adult subjects with PKU. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RTX-134 following intravenous
      administration of a single dose. RTX-134 consists of allogeneic human red cells expressing
      the AvPAL (Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase) gene inside the cell. The trial
      is designed to determine a preliminary dose and inform a dosing schedule that is deemed safe,
      tolerable, and potentially effective. Four dose levels are planned, additional dose levels
      may be explored. Following administration, subjects will be monitored until 28 days after
      last detection of RTX-134. Detection of RTX-134 will be evaluated using multiple
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments including measurement of
      trans-cinnamic acid (tCA).
