  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 open label study of melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) in combination with
      dexamethasone for participants with Al amyloidosis following at least one prior line of
      therapy. Melflufen will be administered on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle in combination with
      dexamethasone on days 1 and 2.

      In both phases, treatment of each individual participant will continue for up to 8 cycles or
      until any stopping events occur.

      Approximately 46 participants will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of melphalan flufenamide (melflufen), a peptide-conjugated alkylator
      which belongs to an novel class of drugs called peptidase-enhanced compounds, and targets the
      transformation process of tumor cells with a unique mechanism of action, as potential
      treatment option of AL amyloidosis.

      AL amyloidosis is a rare progressive disease caused by proteotoxic light chain protein
      produced by small plasma cell clone. This plasma cell dyscrasia is characterized by
      monoclonal plasma cell's excessive production of monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chains that
      tends to misfold and subsequently deposit as amyloid fibrils in visceral organs. The plasma
      cell dyscrasia in AL amyloidosis is similar to that in multiple myeloma (MM) and therapies
      that are effective in MM are often used to treat AL amyloidosis.

      Melphalan flufenamide is currently been evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials in
      patients with multiple myeloma, with observed efficacy. There are currently no therapies
      approved for treatment of AL amyloidosis and based on the efficacy of melphalan flufenamide
      and the demonstrated efficacy of melphalan (and other alkylators), it is anticipated that
      patients with AL amyloidosis may receive benefit from treatment with melphalan flufenamide.

      This study consist of a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (up to 8 cycles)
      and a follow-up period (up to 24 months).

      Phase 1: Approximately 8-30 participants will be screened to achieve 7-23 enrolled
      participants.

      Phase 2: Approximately 30 participants will be screened to achieve 23 enrolled participants.
