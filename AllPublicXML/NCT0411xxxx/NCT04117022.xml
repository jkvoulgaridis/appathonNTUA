      To evaluate the differences in retinal function as measured by ERG in diabetics with and
      without retinopathy 2) the ability of the Chromatic Electroretinogram (chERG) to detect
      changes in global retinal function following treatment with Carotenoid Vitamins supplement in
      patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). 3) the ability of the Full Field flicker (ffERG) to
      detect changes in global retinal function following treatment with Carotenoid Vitamins
      supplement in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR).

      4) Changes in retinal function as observed by OCT-Angiography, following treatment with
      Carotenoid Vitamins supplement in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR).

      This prospective, study has cross-sectional analysis of ERG functions in a group of diabetics
      with and without retinopathy. Both Chromatic ERG and Full field ERG (NOVA, Diopsys, Inc. Pine
      Brook, NJ) will be utilized in the study. Subsequently individuals with an outside normal
      limit outcome on at least one ERG test will be invited to be part of the longitudinal study.
      Individuals with abnormal ERG results will be asked to take the carotenoid vitamin supplement
      (ZeaVision DVS supplement) and the baseline data will be compared to the values at one,
      three- and six-month follow-up.

      The primary endpoint of a patient's follow-up will be at 6 months. The study will be
      performed at three sites. Western University of Health Sciences, Harpers Pointe Eye
      Associates (Externship site College of Optometry, Western University of Health Sciences) and
      Oklahoma College of Optometry, Northeastern State University, Tahlequah, Oklahoma.

      The clinical study plan will be reviewed and approved by Eye Care Center of the Western
      University of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB). Harpers Pointe Eye Associates
      will be covered under an externship site of Western University of Health Sciences.

      NSUOCO will apply for a separate IRB review at their own site.

    <description>The Chromatic Electroretinogram (chERG) and the full field ERG will be recorded using a commercially available system Diopsys® NOVA (Diopsys, Inc. Pine Brook, New Jersey). The Red-Blue stimulus will be presented using a mini-Ganzfeld handheld device. The entire process consists of two tests per eye, with twenty-five seconds allocated for each test; thus, the total duration of the test is one hundred seconds. The chERG will be consecutively recorded from both eyes by means of proprietary adhesive skin electrodes on the lower eyelid and forehead.</description>

    <description>The Flicker ERG will be recorded using a commercially available system, Diopsys® NOVA (Diopsys, Inc., Pine brook, NJ), version 2.19.19778.7332). The Flicker ERG will be consecutively recorded from both eyes by means of adhesive skin electrodes on the lower eyelid and skin. The stimulus will consist of white flashes flickering at 32 Hz over a white background as well as a sequence of 6 steps of increasing luminance.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>OCT angiography measurements will be performed using the Angiovue OCT by Optovue CA. It is a camera system that utilizes interferometry to measure the thickness and vascular profile of the macula and the optic nerve, allowing measurement of radial capillary count in both macula and the peripapillary optic nerve head region</description>

    <description>Oral supplement. Each subject will be given the carotenoid supplement of DVS formula. The DVS formula consists of vitamins C, D3 and E (d-α tocopherol), zinc oxide, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, α-lipoic acid (racemic mixture), coenzyme Q10, mixed tocotrienols/tocopherols, zeaxanthin, lutein, benfotiamine, N-acetyl cysteine, grape seed extract, resveratrol, turmeric root extract, green tea leaf, and Pycnogenol (patented French Maritime Pine Bark extract, sp Pinus pinaster, Horphag Research, Geneva, Switzerland). Supplements bottles will be labelled with a unique identification number for each subject and supplied by ZeaVision, LLC, Chesterfield, Missouri, USA. To assure that the participants do not have any issues with the vitamin supplement and to ensure adequate adherence to schedule of vitamin intake the participants will get regular phone calls from the study investigators (once every two weeks).</description>
