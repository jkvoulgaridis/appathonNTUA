      This will be a Phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, single-dose study in healthy male
      subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28
      days prior to the dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU) on Day -1 and be confined to the CRU until at least Day 8. On Day 1, subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of [14C]-saroglitazar magnesium. Subjects will be discharged if
      the following discharge criteria are met: plasma radioactivity levels below the limit of
      quantitation for 2 consecutive collections and ≥ 90% mass balance recovery, or ≤ 1% of the
      total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta (urine and feces) in 3 consecutive
      24-hour periods in which both are collected. If discharge criteria are not met by Day 8,
      subjects will remain in the CRU up to Day 12.

             this study or participated in a radiolabeled drug study where exposures are not known
             to the Investigator within the previous 6 months prior to admission to the clinic for
             this study. The total 12-month exposure from this study and a maximum of 2 other
             previous radiolabeled studies within 4 to 12 months prior to this study will be within
             the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) recommended levels considered safe, per United
             States (US) Title 21 CFR 361.1: less than 5,000 mrem whole-body annual exposure with
