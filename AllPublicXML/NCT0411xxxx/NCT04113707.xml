  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to investigate if daily motor activities, including
      fitness activities, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and motor coordination activities
      result in physiological, cognitive, and behavioral benefits to children at Odyssey Academy.
      The study will compare students' performance after intervention by comparing an intervention
      period to a standard care period, and comparing intervention students to students engaged in
      standard school activities in the area of academic performance.

      The objective of this study is to track if daily participation in motor lab activities for
      school age children improves their academic performance. Academic performance is associated
      with motor skills, coordination, and executive function. Our objectives are to determine if
      daily participation in motor lab activities changes these skills, to better understand these
      relationships, track outcomes of children participating in motor lab intervention compared to
      non-intervention and children receiving standard level of care in the school, and to be able
      to follow the intervention students over time.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. To investigate whether gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and physical fitness,
           predict executive function skills.

        2. To determine the relationship between these variables and academic performance.

        3. To examine the relationship between participation in motor lab activities and measures
           of change in fitness, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, executive function, and
           academic performance.

        4. To evaluate if participation in daily motor lab activities predicts fitness level, gross
           motor skills, fine motor skills, executive function, and academic success at the end of
           the school year and in the next school year.
