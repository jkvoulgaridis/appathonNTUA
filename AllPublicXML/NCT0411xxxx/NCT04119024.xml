    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of modified immune cells
      (IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells) after a chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment of
      patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma. The study agent is called IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells. T
      cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cells) that have the ability to kill
      tumor cells. The T cells are obtained from the patients own blood, grown in a laboratory, and
      modified by adding the IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene. The IL13Ralpha2 CAR gene is inserted into T
      cells with a virus called a lentivirus. The lentivirus allows cells to make the IL13Ralpha2
      CAR protein. This CAR has been designed to bind to a protein on the surface of tumor cells
      called IL13Ralpha2. This study is being done to determine the dose at which the gene-modified
      immune cells are safe, how long the cells stay in the body, and if the cells are able to
      attack the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Safety.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Clinical response. II. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell tumor infiltration and
      persistence. III. Impact of IL-2 on the persistence and tumor infiltration of IL13Ralpha2 CAR
      T cells.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Cytokine release syndrome analysis. II. Evaluation of endogenous anti-tumor immune
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IL13Ralpha2-specific hinge-optimized
      4-1BB-co-stimulatory CAR/truncated (Cluster of Differentiation 19) CD19-expressing autologous
      TN/MEM cells (IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells).

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -5 to -4 and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 15-30 minutes on days -4 to -1. Patients then receive
      IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells IV on day 0. Patients may also receive recombinant interleukin-2
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then every year for at least 15 years.

             electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities, symptoms of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias
             and have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% on a cardiac stress test

             echocardiogram, or other stress test)

          -  Patients with ECG results of any conduction delays (PR interval &gt; 200 ms, corrected QT
             (QTC) &gt; 480 ms), sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute), sinus
             tachycardia (HR&gt;120 beats per minute) will be evaluated by a cardiologist prior to
             starting the trial. Patients with any arrhythmias, including atrial
             fibrillation/atrial flutter, excessive ectopy (defined as &gt; 20 premature ventricular
             complex [PVC]s per minute), ventricular tachycardia, 3rd degree heart block will be
             excluded from the study unless cleared by a cardiologist

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the
             period of treatment and for 6 months afterwards. All female patients with reproductive
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) at screening and again
             within 14 days from starting the conditioning chemotherapy. The definition of
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the study investigators.
             Patients who are breastfeeding are not allowed on this study
