  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is the recommended analgesic technique in patients having surgery with
      severe postoperative pain such as thoracic and upper abdominal surgery. However, from the
      previous study, the incidence of inadequate pain control in patients receiving epidural
      analgesia is very high 48.6% in our hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hospital is a big tertiary hospital and has many staffs. The high incidence of inadequate
      epidural analgesia may result from variety of epidural techniques and epidural drug
      administrations. The protocol based practice has been developed from acute pain service which
      founded for more than 10 years. By using protocol based practice, we believed that the
      incidence of inadequate epidural analgesia will be less compared with the current practice.
