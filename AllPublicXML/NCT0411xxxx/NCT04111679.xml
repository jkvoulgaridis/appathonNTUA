  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to investigate whether listening to recorded music has a positive
      effect on the execution of laparoscopic skills.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the effects of music during surgical performance on
      blood pressure, mental workload and heart rate.

      Study design: This will be a 4-period 4-sequence 2-treatment crossover study, participants
      will be exposed to both control (noise cancelling headphones without music) and the
      intervention (preferred music via headphones) whilst performing a laparoscopic task in a box
      trainer. Every period consists of 5 repetitions of a laparoscopic peg transfer task. In total
      participants will perform in each condition 10 peg transfer tasks.

      Prior to the experiment, all participants practice the laparoscopic peg transfer task 20
      times

      Study population: Healthy volunteering medicine students without laparoscopic experience.

      Intervention (if applicable): Participants will perform 2 periods of 5 laparoscopic peg
      transfer task whilst listening to preferred recorded music via headphones and 2 periods of 5
      laparoscopic peg transfer tasks while wearing noise cancelling headphones without music (2
      periods of 5 tasks).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is laparoscopic performance as defined
      by time of task completion Secondary endpoints are: laparoscopic task performance (path
      length, jerk, error score, economy of motion) vital parameters (heart rate, and post test
      blood pressure) and mental workload (SURG-TLX)

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a 4-period 4-sequence 2-treatment crossover study, participants will be exposed to both control group (A), the silent group, and intervention group (B), the music group, whilst performing a laparoscopic task in a box trainer.
Participants will be randomly assigned to a sequence that determines in which order they are being exposed to both auditory environments</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Time to task completion (s)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured during the experimental session which will take up about 1 hour in total</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured in seconds and calculated using data generated from motion analysis software. Each tasks starts, when the participants puts the tip of the grasper in a yellow square that is projected on the screen, after task completion the participant puts tip in the square again to finish the task. The time between start and finish is defined as the time to task completion.
An average is calculated for both the 10 tasks in the intervention group and the 10 tasks in the control group.</description>

    <description>The total distance the tip of the instrument has travelled per task (mm) per task, it will be calculated using data generated from motion analysis software. Each tasks starts, when the participants puts the tip of the grasper in a yellow square that is projected on the screen, after task completion the participant puts tip in the square again to finish the task. An average is calculated for both the 10 tasks in the intervention group and the 10 tasks in the control group.</description>

    <measure>Normalized jerk</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured during the experimental session which will take up about 1 hour in total</time_frame>
    <description>the rate of change of acceleration of the instrument tips (m/s3) per task. It will be calculated using data generated from motion analysis software. Each tasks starts, when the participants puts the tip of the grasper in a yellow square that is projected on the screen, after task completion the participant puts tip in the square again to finish the task. An average is calculated for both the 10 tasks in the intervention group and the 10 tasks in the control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental workload</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured during the experimental session which will take up about 1 hour in total</time_frame>
    <description>Mental workload will be assessed using the Surgery task load index (SURG-TLX) this is a validated multidimensional, surgery-specific workload measure. The SURG-TLX is an adapted version of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).
In the SURG-TLX subjects rate six dimensions of workload i.e. situational stress, distractions, task complexity, physical demands, temporal demands and mental demands on visual analogue scales VAS ranging from 0-100 (0 = very low;100 = very high) the scores of these subscales are combined into a weighed average that results in a general score ranging from 0-100 (0 = very low; 100 = very high) After every period of 5 tasks a SURG-TLX questionnaire is completed. An average is calculated for both the two periods in the intervention group and the two periods in the control group. The averages of both the general score and the individual subscales will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured during the experimental session which will take up about 1 hour in total</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be assessed prior to; and immediately after every period of laparoscopic tasks in beats per minute. Change in heart rate before and after each period of tasks is calculated. An average change will be calculated for both the two periods in the intervention group and the two periods in the control group</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured during the experimental session which will take up about 1 hour in total</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic pressure will be assessed prior to and immediately after every period of laparoscopic tasks in mmHg. Change in blood pressure before and after each period of tasks is calculated. An average change will be calculated for both the two periods in the intervention group and the two periods in the control group</description>
