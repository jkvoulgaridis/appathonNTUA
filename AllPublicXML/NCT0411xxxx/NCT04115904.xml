      Aim to compare acute pain rate after single-visit ortwo-visits treatment of teeth with
      necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis .90 teeth with a diagnosis of pulp necrosis and apical
      radiolucency at the apex.Working length was established with EAL and confirmed
      radiographically. Flex-R files were used to complete canal preparation. Level ofdiscomfort
      were recorded and cases with acute postoperative pain.

    <description>All treatment sessions were approximately 45 minutes in length to allow for acceptable time for completionof treatment and retreatment in one or two visits. Allthe clinical procedures were performed by the author.Following local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with1:100,000 epinephrine (Septodont Saint-Maur desFossés, France) and rubber dam isolation the toothwas disinfected with 5.25% NaOCl (Ultra bleach,Bentonville, AR, USA).</description>
