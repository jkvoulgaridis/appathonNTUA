  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, steroids and anti-VEGF are the first line treatment for diabetic macular edema.
      Ozurdex is the most frequently used steroid and has label for both first and second line
      treatment. Ozurdex treatment paradigm for patients with diabetic macular edema is to inject
      patient only in case of huge recurrence. The risk of this scheme is a progressive loss of
      vision due to photoreceptors loss. A more pro-active regimen, as it already exists for
      anti-VEGF treatment, would allow a better patient management. A new treatment paradigm
      consisting in a loading dose of 2 injections within 3 months, followed by a PRN (Pro Re Nata)
      regimen with strict retreatment criteria and minimal time limit of 3 months between two
      injections should result in a better visual acuity gain and a limited augmentation of the
      number of injections (which will remain lower than the number observed for anti-VEGF
      treatment).

      The investigators have therefore chosen a pilot study to investigate the impact on efficacy
      and on the number of intravitreal injections (IVI) of such a scheme.
