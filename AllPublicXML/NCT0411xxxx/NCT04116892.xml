    <textblock>
      This study compares the anatomical and visual outcomes in a large series of patients affected
      by idiopathic macular holes larger than 400 µm treated using pars plana vitrectomy and gas
      tamponade combined with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling or the inverted internal
      limiting membrane flap technique. A part of the participants will receive internal limiting
      membrane peeling,whil the other will receive the inverted internal limiting membrane flap
      technique.

    <textblock>
      Vitrectomy is the standard treatment for idiopathic macular holes (IMHs) and is combined with
      removal of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) to improve anatomical outcomes.However,
      surgical closure is not achieved after a single operation in all cases, and patients with
      long-standing MHs or highly myopic eyes are challenging to treat.Various surgical strategies
      have been introduced to improve postoperative outcomes for these cases. Michalewska et al.
      have reported an inverted ILM flap technique for large MHs. The ILM around the MH was left to
      cover or fill the hole and showed a better anatomical closure rate and visual outcome than
      ILM peeling for large MHs. Nevertheless, the functional and anatomic outcomes of the ILM flap
      technique have not been investigated as extensively as the ILM peeling technique and have yet
      to be confirmed by research comparing the ILM flap technique with the conventional procedure.
