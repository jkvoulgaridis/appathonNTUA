  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators compare timely acquirement and effectiveness of 12-lead ECG
      using patchy-type wireless versus using defibrillator which contain ECG examination function
      in ambulance.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the difference of timely acquirement of 12-lead ECG
      using two different systems and the difference of efficiency of ECG examination in ambulance
      between two groups.

      The participants in this simulation study were divided randomly into 2 groups :

      Group A is performing an ECG examination on mock patient using defibrillator which contained
      12-lead ECG checking function. And take a 15 minutes wash out period. After the wash out
      period, group A subject performing an ECG examination using patchy-type wireless device.

      Group B subject is performing an ECG examination on mock patient using patchy-type wireless
      device first, and take a 15 minutes wash out period. After the wash out period, group B
      performing an ECG examination using defibrillator which contain 12-lead ECG function.

      Both group's ECG examination is performing in the ambulance.

First ECG performance will be using defibrillator which contain 12-lead ECG checking function. And taking a 15 minutes wash out period. Second ECG performance after wash out period, will be using patchy-type wireless device.
when ECG examination performance ended, survey of patchy-type wireless ECG device usability will be collect.</description>
