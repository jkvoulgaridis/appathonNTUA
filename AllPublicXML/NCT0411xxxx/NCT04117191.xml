  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
      is associated with extremely poor prognosis. Traditional risk factors for the general
      population, such as diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia, are more common
      in patients with CKD but cannot fully explain the increased risk of this population. New
      evidence suggests that the uremic milieu itself plays a critical role in the development and
      progression of CVD. The gut microbiota is markedly altered in CKD, with overgrowth of
      bacteria that produce uremic toxins. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is among the most representative
      gut‚Äêderived uremic toxins and has been most frequently implicated as a contributor to the
      pathogenesis of CVD in CKD. IS is converted from indole, a gut bacteria metabolite of dietary
      tryptophan, by two hepatic enzymes, CYP2E1 and SULT1A1. The majority of studies have assessed
      IS toxicity in cultured cells and animal models. However, human data have been conflicting
      and the benefit of using orally administered adsorbents to reduce IS levels in unselected CKD
      patients was not supported by results from the recent randomized controlled trials. IS levels
      may fluctuate widely from time to time with dietary intakes. The investigators hypothesize
      that a postprandial IS concentration may more reflect its toxicity than a single time point
      (fasting or predialysis IS) concentration measured in clinical studies. Therefore, the
      investigators plan to establish an oral tryptophan challenge test (OTCT) by using an oral
      loading of 2 gm tryptophan to simulate the postprandial increase of plasma IS. The
      investigators will recruit 60 healthy volunteers to undergo OTCT. A pharmacokinetic study of
      IS after the OTCT will be performed in 20 of them to verify and simplify the design of OTCT
      protocol. The results of OTCT will be integrated with whole metagenome analysis of fecal
      microbiota and genetic polymorphism analysis of CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 to explore the mechanisms
      of IS production. In addition to the known genes in microbe produces indoles, other
      supporting bacteria or genes will be examined by using metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.
