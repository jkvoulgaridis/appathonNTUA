  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, 2 period, 2 sequence, cross over, single dose
      study to evaluate the AUC equivalence, and safety of tofacitinib 5 mL oral solution (1 mg/mL)
      and 5 mg tablet in healthy participants. Participants will be randomized to 1 of the 2
      treatment sequences. A total of approximately 12 healthy male and/or female (non-childbearing
      potential) participants will be enrolled in the study so that approximately 6 participants
      will be enrolled in each treatment sequence. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2
      periods. In both sequences, participants will remain in the CRU for a total of 5 days and 4
      nights (including Period 1 and Period 2).

             by the investigator), evidence of any infection within the past 7 days prior to the
             baseline visit, history of disseminated herpes simplex infection or recurrent (&gt;1
             episode) herpes zoster or disseminated herpes zoster.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;
             positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.

          -  Malignancy or a history of malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated or
             excised non metastatic basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin or cervical
