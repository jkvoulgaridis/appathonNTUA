  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of Recombinant Human
      Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator Derivative(rPA) and Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen
      Activator(rt-PA) for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism.

      This trial includes two stages, the first stage is to study the dosage of administration of
      the test drug(rPA), the second is to compare the efficacy and safety of rPA and rt-PA. Both
      of the two stages are randomized, open and parallel controlled.

    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, open and parallel controlled project designed for
      patients with acute pulmonary embolism requiring thrombolysis after anticoagulant therapy in
      high-risk and middle-high risk populations.

      For the first stage: Subjects who are qualified for the screening criteria according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to low-dose test drugs, high-dose
      test drugs or reference drugs for thrombolytic therapy at a ratio of 1:1:1.

      For the second stage: Subjects who are qualified for the screening criteria according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to rPA(test group)or rt-PA(control
      group) for thrombolytic therapy at a ratio of 1:1.

    <time_frame>48 hours (Day 3)after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary artery occlusion index is calculated according to Qanadli scores. There are 10 segmental arteries in each pulmonary artery (3 in the upper lobes, 2 in the middle or lingual arteries, and 5 in the inferior lobes), 1 segment of arterial partial obstruction is 1 point, complete obstruction is 2 points, and the total score is divided by 40 (the total score of complete obstruction of bilateral pulmonary arteries) is the pulmonary artery obstruction index.
Thrombus opening rate is calculated by the Qanadli CT embolization index, the formula is as follows: improvement (%) = (significant improvement cases + mild improvement cases) / overall number of cases, significant improvement = Qanadli CT embolization index decreased from baseline ≥ 75%; mild improvement = Qanadli CT embolization index decreased by ≥25% and &lt;75% from baseline; unchanged = Qanadli CT embolization index decreased &lt;25% from baseline; deterioration = Qanadli CT embolization index increased from baseline.</description>
