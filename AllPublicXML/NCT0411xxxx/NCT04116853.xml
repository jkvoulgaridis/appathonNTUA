  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of
      phone-based extended care delivered on an ADAPTIVE (when participants are at &quot;high risk&quot; for
      weight regain as assessed by a predictive algorithm) vs. STATIC (gold-standard,
      once-per-month frequency) schedule on weight loss maintenance. The study team will provide
      participants with an initial behavioral weight management program, and then randomize
      participants who successfully achieve a clinically-significant weight loss of ≥5% to one of
      the two extended-care conditions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity remains a substantial public health challenge in the United States. While behavioral
      lifestyle interventions have been demonstrated to produce weight losses of 8-10% in adults
      with overweight and obesity, long-term outcomes are suboptimal, limiting effectiveness for
      long-term weight loss maintenance.

      The study team will evaluate methods for providing phone-based extended-care to support
      weight loss maintenance. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial
      assessing the impact of phone-based extended care delivered on an ADAPTIVE (when we determine
      that participants are at &quot;high risk&quot; for weight regain) vs. STATIC (once-per-month frequency
      used in gold-standard extended-care programs) schedule on weight loss maintenance.
      Participants will be provided with an initial in-person, group-based behavioral weight
      management program. Participants who successfully achieve a clinically-significant weight
      loss between baseline and Month 4 (defined by the Institute of Medicine as a reduction in
      weight of ≥ 5% from baseline) will be randomized into the clinical trial. Follow-up visits
      will occur at Month 12 and Month 24 after initial intervention baseline.
