  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erector Spinae Plane Block is a newly defined regional anesthesia technique. Its use for many
      indications has been identified by case reports in the literature. As the investigators have
      considered that erector spinae plane block could be efficacious for providing postoperative
      analgesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the investigators have implemented the application
      of this blockade into practice at the clinic Subcostal transverse abdominis plane block
      (STAP) is another regional anesthesia technic used for postoperative analgesia in
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Main purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic effect
      of ultrasound-guided erector spinae block and STAP in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

    <description>Changes in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and on movement will be recorded at intervals. NRS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <description>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score will be recorded from recovery room followed by 2.-4.-6.-12.-24.hours. Intravenous meperidine administration at 0.5 mg / kg rescue analgesia was determined in patients with a NSR score of 4 and over in the postoperative collection room. It is planned that the patient will continue to follow the hourly NRS score in ward. Intramuscular diclofenac will be administered in this period if NRS 4 and if it is over, intravenous 0.5 mg / kg meperidine will be administered if NRS score is 4 or more after 2 hours. Salvage analgesic needs and times will be noted in detail, and the use of rescue analgesics, as well as NRS scores at designated hours, will be kept in a statistical evaluation.</description>
