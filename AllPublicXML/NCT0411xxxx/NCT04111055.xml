  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension and blood pressure variability are associated with postoperative
      complications in surgical patients.

      The investigators have developed a closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller that titrates
      norepinephrine to correct hypotension.

      After having tested the system in a small cohort series of patients undergoing major
      surgeries, the investigators aimed to test the feasibility of the CLV controller guided
      noninvasively and continuously with the ClearSight system (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) in
      three high risk patients undergoing renal transplant surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension is frequent in patients undergoing surgery and can negatively
      impact organ perfusion.

      The investigators have developed a closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller to more
      efficiently correct hypotension.

      The investigators tested it extensively in preclinical studies and recently demonstrated its
      feasibility and excellent performance metrics in a short series of high-risk patients
      undergoing major surgical procedures.

      In these studies, the controller was linked to a minimally-invasive advanced hemodynamic
      monitoring device utilizing an arterial line which then controlled a vasopressor infusion.
      However, the vast majority of patients who undergo surgery do not require an arterial line
      but should still benefit from rapid corrections of hypotensive episodes that are less rapidly
      detected via an intermittent non-invasive blood pressure cuff. Fortunately, completely
      noninvasive technology now allows us to continuously monitor blood pressure and therefore
      extend the use of our closed-loop vasopressor system to patients in whom an arterial catheter
      would not typically be placed. Patients undergoing renal transplant surgeries are the ideal
      patient population.

      The investigators aimed to test the feasibility of guiding our CLV controller with a
      continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device (ClearSight system, Edwards
      Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) in three patients (case series)

    <description>The MAP of the patient will be managed by the CLV system to avoid hypotension. The MAP target selected in the closed-loop system will be the patient's MAP target ( same target as patient's MAP value preoperatively). Then the closed-loop system will have to adjust norepinephrine infusion rate to keep that MAP value within 10% of patient's target.</description>
