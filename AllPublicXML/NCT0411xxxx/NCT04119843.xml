      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and diagnostic efficacy of
      Mangoral in liver MRI in patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions and severe
      renal impairment. The diagnostic efficacy of Mangoral will be assessed in terms of
      visualization of detected focal liver lesions in combined MRI (CMRI: combined
      Mangoral-enhanced and unenhanced MRI) compared to unenhanced MRI.

      The overall objective of this multicenter, open-label, study is to evaluate the safety and
      diagnostic efficacy of Mangoral in patients with known or suspected focal liver lesions and
      severe renal impairment. Study treatment is a single oral dose of Mangoral (800 mg manganese
      chloride [II] tetrahydrate, 500 mg L-alanine, and 800 IU vitamin D3). Adult male and female
      patients with severe renal impairment or acute kidney injury and who are being evaluated for
      known or suspected focal liver lesions will be included. Primary diagnostic efficacy in terms
      of visualization of detected lesions will be evaluated centrally by 3 independent readers.
      Study MRIs will also be evaluated by the on-site radiologists for the assessment of secondary
      objectives and for clinical purposes.
