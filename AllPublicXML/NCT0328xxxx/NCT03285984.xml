    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the plaque removal efficacy of four
      experimental toothpastes following a single timed brushing. Prior to each treatment visit,
      participants will abstain from oral hygiene for a period of 24 hours (+6hrs, -2hrs),
      immediately preceding a pre-brushing dental plaque evaluation. Participants will then brush
      once under supervision for one timed minute with each dentifrice after which re-disclosing
      and a post-brushing plaque assessment will be carried out.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single centre, randomized, controlled, examiner blind, four treatment,
      four period crossover design. At the screening visit, following provision of written informed
      consent, eligible participants will be provided with a washout toothpaste and toothbrush for
      use at home during the study and for at least 14 days prior to the first treatment visit.

      Participants will then be scheduled to attend the first of four treatment visits a minimum of
      14 days later. For each treatment visit, participants must abstain from oral hygiene for a
      period of 24 hours (+6hrs, -2hrs), immediately preceding the pre-brushing dental plaque
      evaluation. All the participants will undergo an oral soft tissue (OST) examination followed
      by disclosing and a dental plaque assessment.

      At the treatment visit 1 pre-brushing plaque assessment, those who develop a sufficient
      amount of plaque (Turesky mean score ≥ 2.00) will be randomized to study treatment.
      Participants will then brush once (1.5 grams [g] ± 0.05g of assigned toothpaste), under
      supervision of study staff for one timed minute, with one of the four test toothpastes after
      which re-disclosing and a post-brushing plaque assessment will be carried out. Participants
      will be allowed to brush with the washout paste following the post assessment plaque
      assessments.

      A minimum of three days washout period will follow each treatment period during which period
      Participants will brush with a commercial washout toothpaste. Participants will complete four
      treatment visits and will brush once with each of the four test toothpastes throughout the
      course of the study.

    <description>The dental examiner used Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth.Overall plaque scores were calculated taking average over all tooth sites for participant.Plaque was first disclosed using dye solution followed by disclosing solution.They expectorated and rinsed with 10 milliliters (mL) water for 10 seconds (sec),expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial,facial,distofacial,mesiolingual,lingual,distolingual surfaces.Disclosed plaque was scored for each tooth surface separately as:0 No plaque;1 Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of the tooth;2 A thin continuous band of plaque(1 mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth;3 A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of tooth;4 Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of crown of tooth;5 Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth.Score range 0-5.Lower scores indicate less plaque area.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Pre-brushing to Post-brushing) in Turesky Score After Single Supervised Use (Test Product 1 Versus [vs] Test Product 4) After 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The dental examiner used Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth.Overall plaque scores were calculated taking average over all tooth sites for participant.Plaque was first disclosed using dye solution followed by disclosing solution.They expectorated and rinsed with 10 milliliters (mL) water for 10 seconds (sec),expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial,facial,distofacial,mesiolingual,lingual,distolingual surfaces.Disclosed plaque was scored for each tooth surface separately as:0 No plaque;1 Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of the tooth;2 A thin continuous band of plaque(1 mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth;3 A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of tooth;4 Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of crown of tooth;5 Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth.Score range 0-5.Lower scores indicate less plaque area.</description>
