  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO3, a CAR T cell treatment
      targeting CD19 and CD22 followed by limited duration of anti-PD1 antibody in patients with
      DLBCL
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation and expansion phase, and a
      Phase II. Patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL will be enrolled in both phases of the
      study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which is the
      starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR T product AUTO3 which is a CD19
      and CD22 dual targeting CAR T cell product. Following pre-conditioning by a chemotherapeutic
      regimen, the patient will receive AUTO 3 intravenously as a single dose and in addition a
      limited duration of treatment with an anti-PD1 antibody (either as part of the
      pre-conditioning regimen or consolidation). Patients will then enter a 24-month follow-up
      period.
