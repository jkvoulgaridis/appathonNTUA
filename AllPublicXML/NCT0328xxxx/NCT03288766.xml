  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center study to assess clinical performance of
      the SHERLOCK 3CG™ Diamond Tip Confirmation System (TCS) with MODUS II software for confirming
      correct tip position of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in adult subjects
      with altered cardiac rhythm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to confirm the accuracy of the SHERLOCK 3CG™ Diamond TCS with the
      addition of MODUS II (SLM2) software to eliminate the need for post-procedural chest x-ray
      (CXR) in adult subjects with cardiac abnormalities that alter presentation of the P-wave.
      Atrial fibrillation will be the primary target while data on pacemaker driven rhythms and
      other arrhythmia types will also be collected to explore overall performance.

    <time_frame>The PICC insertion procedure is 60-90 mins in duration</time_frame>
    <description>Tip positioning is determined at bedside by the software via the Green Diamond Indicator (GDI+) and confirmed by CXR. PICC tip placement will be considered successful if it is determined to be in the lower 1/3 of the SVC or in the CAJ by an independent, blinded radiologist judging position retrospectively against pre-specified anatomical criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of successful PICC tip placement within the lower third of the superior vena cava (SVC) or in the cavoatrial junction (CAJ) using SLM2 in the absence of a GDI</measure>
    <time_frame>The PICC insertion procedure is 60-90 mins in duration</time_frame>
    <description>It is expected there will be some cases where the MODUS II software may fail to present a Green Diamond Indicator (GDI-). In the absence of a GDI, tip positioning is determined at bedside using magnetic tracking and external measurement per hospital protocol, with CXR required for tip confirmation. PICC tip placement will be considered successful if it is determined to be in the lower 1/3 of the SVC or in the CAJ by an independent, blinded radiologist judging position retrospectively against pre-specified anatomical criteria.</description>

    <description>The SHERLOCK 3CG™ Diamond Tip Confirmation System (TCS) is an FDA-cleared fully-integrated magnetic tracking and ECG-based PICC tip confirmation technology, indicated for use as an alternative to chest x-ray and fluoroscopy for PICC tip placement confirmation in adult patients without any alterations of cardiac rhythms that change the normal presentation of the P-wave. A software package, MODUS II, has been developed to accurately analyze the entire ECG complex and identify the correct placement of the PICC tip based on a patient's individual ECG, in the absence of an easily identifiable P-wave. This software system is designed to provide visual and/or audio cues to notify the PICC placer of the location of the PICC tip relative to the cavoatrial junction (CAJ) of the patient.</description>

        Subjects will be adult males or females ≥ 21 years of age with identifiable alterations of
        cardiac rhythm. For this study, altered cardiac rhythm is defined as any condition that
        does not have a P-wave on ECG.
