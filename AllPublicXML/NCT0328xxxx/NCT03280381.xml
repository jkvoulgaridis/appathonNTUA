  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will establish an evidence base for the Nifty Feeding Cup by evaluating its
      effectiveness and caregiver satisfaction. The investigators will conduct a randomized
      crossover trial that compares the Nifty Feeding Cup to a standardized, generic medicine cup
      used to feed preterm infants with breastfeeding difficulties at Komfo Anokye Teaching
      Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the Nifty Feeding Cup to a standardized, generic cup in up
      to 200 preterm infants. The aim and hypotheses were selected based on the most informative
      outcomes given the scope of the funding. The investigators will test the hypotheses that
      Nifty Feeding Cup feeding compared to generic cup feeding will result in:

        1. Less spillage

        2. Greater caregiver satisfaction

        3. Shorter duration of feeds

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will conduct a randomized crossover trial in mothers/caregivers with a preterm infant in the mother-baby unit at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana. Each caregiver/infant pair will use the Nifty Feeding Cup for two feeds and the standardized generic cup for two feeds. Cross-over means each caregiver/infant pair will use both cups, with the order of the cup used first and second randomized.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>24-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver's satisfaction will be the cup she prefers, which will be recorded in the In-Hospital Preference Survey completed after the caregiver has finished the feeding portion of the study. Data refers to number of caregivers who prefer the Nifty Cup.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spillage</measure>
    <time_frame>24-36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Spillage will be reported as a percent with the amount of milk in grams spilled/mopped up divided by the total amount of milk weighed in grams less the total amount of milk not used. Each caregiver-infant pair will be provided with a bib cloth for each observed feeding. The bib cloth will be weighed before and after each feed and the weights recorded on the Feeding Assessment form. The difference between the pre and post weights will be used as the measure of the amount spilled. A digital scale will be used to measure the milk weight, which will be recorded in grams.</description>

            <title>NIFTY Feeding Cup First</title>
            <description>Each caregiver/infant pair will first use the Nifty Feeding Cup for two feeds and then the standardized generic cup for two feeds.
Nifty Feeding Cup: The 40 mL cup features an extended reservoir off the lip of the cup that holds a small bolus of milk, has embossed measurements to track volume and intake of milk, is ergonomically designed for frequent use and to enhance finger and wrist control of milk flow and is made from a quick-drying, ultraviolet radiation-resistant, durable, affordable and soft silicone that can be boiled for sterilization. Mothers can directly express into the cup, reducing possible cross-contamination from other containers.
Generic medicine cup: A generic 30 mL small medicine cup was used in this study. Small medicine cups are manufactured by many manufacturers and are generally translucent and calibrated with a variety of measurements. They are commonly used in health facilities to feed breastmilk to infants who are having breastfeeding difficulties.</description>

        <description>Spillage will be reported as a percent with the amount of milk in grams spilled/mopped up divided by the total amount of milk weighed in grams less the total amount of milk not used. Each caregiver-infant pair will be provided with a bib cloth for each observed feeding. The bib cloth will be weighed before and after each feed and the weights recorded on the Feeding Assessment form. The difference between the pre and post weights will be used as the measure of the amount spilled. A digital scale will be used to measure the milk weight, which will be recorded in grams.</description>
