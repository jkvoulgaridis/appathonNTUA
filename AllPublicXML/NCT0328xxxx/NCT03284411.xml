    <description>To characterize the effect of four different amplitude settings on baseline SCS therapy satisfaction. At each follow-up visit, the following question was asked to measure satisfaction: &quot;Overall how satisfied or unsatisfied are you with this therapy?&quot;. The response choices were as follows: &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;somewhat unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;very unsatisfied&quot;. Each subject was considered to have maintained their baseline SCS therapy satisfaction if they selected the response &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot;, otherwise they were considered dissatisfied with the therapy. The first visit in which each subject reported dissatisfaction of the therapy was recorded. The amplitude used during the prior visit was then considered to be the minimum amplitude that maintained each subject's therapy satisfaction. The frequency and percentage of subjects' that maintained baseline satisfaction were reported at each amplitude level.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Maintaining Baseline Pain as Measured on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the effect of four different amplitude settings on baseline pain relief. During each follow-up period the VAS pain score was recorded once a day, on a multi-day diary, where subjects rated their pain by making a vertical slash mark through the 0-10 cm line that best described their pain during the last 24 hours, with 0 = No pain and 10 = Worst pain imaginable. The higher VAS pain score represented worse pain. The average VAS pain scores from the last 3 days of the diary prior to the scheduled visit was used for analysis. Each subject was considered to have maintained their baseline pain if there was less than a 2 point increase in their average pain score at the follow-up period. The amplitude used during the prior visit was then considered to be the minimum amplitude that maintained the subject's pain relief. The frequency and percentage of subjects' that maintained their average baseline VAS pain score were reported at each amplitude level.</description>

        <title>SCS Therapy Satisfaction</title>
        <description>To characterize the effect of four different amplitude settings on baseline SCS therapy satisfaction. At each follow-up visit, the following question was asked to measure satisfaction: &quot;Overall how satisfied or unsatisfied are you with this therapy?&quot;. The response choices were as follows: &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;somewhat unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;very unsatisfied&quot;. Each subject was considered to have maintained their baseline SCS therapy satisfaction if they selected the response &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot;, otherwise they were considered dissatisfied with the therapy. The first visit in which each subject reported dissatisfaction of the therapy was recorded. The amplitude used during the prior visit was then considered to be the minimum amplitude that maintained each subject's therapy satisfaction. The frequency and percentage of subjects' that maintained baseline satisfaction were reported at each amplitude level.</description>

          <title>SCS Therapy Satisfaction</title>
          <description>To characterize the effect of four different amplitude settings on baseline SCS therapy satisfaction. At each follow-up visit, the following question was asked to measure satisfaction: &quot;Overall how satisfied or unsatisfied are you with this therapy?&quot;. The response choices were as follows: &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;somewhat unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;very unsatisfied&quot;. Each subject was considered to have maintained their baseline SCS therapy satisfaction if they selected the response &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot;, otherwise they were considered dissatisfied with the therapy. The first visit in which each subject reported dissatisfaction of the therapy was recorded. The amplitude used during the prior visit was then considered to be the minimum amplitude that maintained each subject's therapy satisfaction. The frequency and percentage of subjects' that maintained baseline satisfaction were reported at each amplitude level.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Maintaining Baseline Pain as Measured on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>To characterize the effect of four different amplitude settings on baseline pain relief. During each follow-up period the VAS pain score was recorded once a day, on a multi-day diary, where subjects rated their pain by making a vertical slash mark through the 0-10 cm line that best described their pain during the last 24 hours, with 0 = No pain and 10 = Worst pain imaginable. The higher VAS pain score represented worse pain. The average VAS pain scores from the last 3 days of the diary prior to the scheduled visit was used for analysis. Each subject was considered to have maintained their baseline pain if there was less than a 2 point increase in their average pain score at the follow-up period. The amplitude used during the prior visit was then considered to be the minimum amplitude that maintained the subject's pain relief. The frequency and percentage of subjects' that maintained their average baseline VAS pain score were reported at each amplitude level.</description>
