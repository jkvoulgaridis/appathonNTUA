        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  R/M cSCC cohort only:

          -  Has cSCC that is either metastatic defined as disseminated disease, and/or
             unresectable disease that is not curable by surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy.

          -  Has histologically-confirmed cSCC as the primary site of malignancy (metastatic skin
             involvement from another primary cancer or from an unknown primary cancer is not
             permitted).

          -  LA cSCC cohort only:

          -  Must be ineligible for surgical resection.

          -  Participants who received prior radiation therapy (RT) to index site or must be deemed
             to be not eligible for RT unless the lesion has grown since receiving the RT.

          -  Participants who received prior systemic therapy for curative intent are eligible
             regardless of regimen.

          -  Has metastatic disease defined as disseminated disease distant to the initial/primary
             site of diagnosis, and/or must have locally recurrent disease that has been previously
             treated (with either surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy), and is not amenable
             to either curative surgery, radiotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy treatment.

          -  Has a history of (noninfectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
