      Study PT-112-102, a multicenter, open-label dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of PT-112
      in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      This is designed as a two-part study. In the first part of the study, cohorts of three
      patients (expanded to six patients in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity) will receive
      escalating doses of PT-112 until the MTD is reached, based on tolerability observed during
      the first 28 days of treatment. In the second part of the study, an expansion cohort of 14
      patients will be treated at the recommended dose to confirm the tolerability of treatment and
      evaluate evidence of treatment efficacy.
