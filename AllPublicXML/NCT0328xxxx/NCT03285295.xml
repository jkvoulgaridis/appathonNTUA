  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the performance and intended use of each of the
      Alinity s investigational assays in a donor screening environment using clinical specimens to
      evaluate assay performance characteristics. A comparison of assay performance will be done
      versus the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed assays. The data will be used to
      support regulatory submissions and/or publications.

      This study evaluates Alinity s investigational assays using the Alinity s System. The Alinity
      s System is a high-volume, automated, blood-screening analyzer that is designed to determine
      the presence of specific antigens and antibodies by using chemiluminescent microparticle
      immunoassay (CMIA) detection technology. The system performs high-throughput routine and stat
      processing that features continuous access and automated retesting.

      The Alinity s System is used for infectious disease marker testing in blood-screening and
      plasma laboratories for the following assays: Anti-HBc, Anti-HCV, HTLV I/II, Chagas, HBsAg,
      HBsAg Confirmatory and HIV Ag/Ab Combo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy donors who consented to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For testing with the Alinity s Chagas assay, exclude donors that have been screened on
             a previous donation using a licensed test for antibodies to T cruzi.

        Note: A subject may participate at different times during the study for separate assay
        studies, but each subject should be represented only once for each assay.

        The protocol does not define an age limit. A donor must be at least 17 years old to donate
        to the general blood supply, or 16 years old with parental/guardian consent, if allowed by
        state law.

This population included individuals with HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. The HIV-1 specimens were confirmed positive by HIV-1 Western blot and categorized by revised surveillance case definitions for HIV infection (2008) as stage 1 (n=488), stage 2 (n=427) or stage 3 (n=101) using CD4 counts and associated diagnosis. The specimens were confirmed positive for HIV-2 by HIV-2 Western blot and typed as HIV-2 only by Bio-Rad Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test.The remaining are for Anti-HIV 2 (n=232), HIV-1 antigen (n=35), and HIV-1 viral isolates (n=53).</description>
