      Objective

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-faceted, clinical decision
      support intervention aimed at improving the quality of decisions about Cardio Pulmonary
      Resuscitation (CPR) for seriously ill, elderly patients in hospital.

      The hypothesis is that fewer patients in the intervention group will have a documented order
      for CPR and they will have greater satisfaction with decision making about CPR than patients
      in the control group.

      Methodological Approach

      The study will be a randomized controlled trial comparing a multi-faceted decision support
      intervention to usual care for hospitalized patients. The primary objective of this study is
      to determine if our multifaceted intervention changes decisions about CPR. The components of
      the multifaceted intervention have already been evaluated for feasibility and acceptability
      in the hospital setting. The intervention has two parts: the first is a values clarification
      exercise, and the second part is a CPR video decision aid that explains the risks and
      benefits of CPR as well as the reasons a patient may choose to receive CPR or not. From
      previous research it is known that many hospitalized patients have prescribed orders for CPR
      despite expressing a preference not to have CPR when asked. Furthermore patients often have
      expressed values that are not concordant with their expressed wishes regarding resuscitation.
      Therefore it is hypothesized that fewer patients in the intervention group will have a
      documented order for CPR and they will have greater satisfaction with decision making about
      CPR than patients in the control group.

      We will conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate whether the intervention is more
      effective among patients who remain in hospital longer after enrollment. We will measure the
      intervention effect among patients who remained in hospital for fewer than three days after
      enrollment, among patients who were in hospital for 3-7 days after enrollment, and among
      patients who remained in hospital for longer than 7 days post-enrollment.

    <description>In addition to the regular conversation about CPR that a patient's physician may have with them, participants will be given a two-part intervention. First, the participant will receive a values clarification tool which helps them rate and understand which relevant values are most important to them. There are two forms of this tool, a full and simplified version. All participants in this arm will receive both, in randomized order. The second aspect of the intervention is an educational video about the potential risks and benefits of CPR, which all participants in this arm will receive.</description>
