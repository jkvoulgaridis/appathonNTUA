      This study evaluates the use of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and dexamethasone in
      subjects with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Subjects will receive treatment in
      3 phases - induction (6 cycles), consolidation (6 cycles), and maintenance (12 cycles). Each
      cycle is 28 days.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center phase 2 study of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and
      dexamethasone in subjects with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Myeloma remains
      incurable with the current approaches. The typical natural history of myeloma is one of
      repeated relapses, accompanied by genetic evolution and development of new abnormalities,
      which are often responsible for drug resistance. The presence of a precursor phase of
      smoldering myeloma, and the ability to identify those at the highest risk of progression,
      sets the stage to examine the possibility that we can cure the disease through early
      intervention. In order to potentially achieve this, we need to develop a highly effective
      combination that includes the most active drugs from different classes. Carfilzomib in
      combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone results in high response rates and deep
      responses in subjects with newly diagnosed myeloma. Daratumumab in combination with
      lenalidomide results in high response rates in relapsed refractory disease. All these drugs
      are well tolerated and subjects are able to stay on them long term as a maintenance
      treatment. The combination of the carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab and dexamethasone
      presents the potential to enhance the effectiveness of the regimens. We hypothesize that this
      combination will lead to deep response including a higher proportion of minimal residual
      disease (MRD) negative disease among those with high risk smoldering myeloma and may
      translate into cure or long term disease quiescence.

          -  If any of the following exist at screening, subject will not be eligible for trial
             because this trial involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and
             teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown:

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Nursing women

          -  Other concurrent chemotherapy, or any ancillary therapy considered investigational.
             NOTE: Bisphosphonates are considered to be supportive care rather than therapy, and
             are thus allowed while on protocol treatment.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 3 on clinical examination or grade 2 with pain within 30
             days prior to C1D1.

             cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial
             infarction within the past 6 months. Note: Prior to trial entry, any ECG abnormality
             at screening must be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) II, III, IV heart failure

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie., subjects who are HBsAg
             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or
             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels.
             Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: subjects with serologic
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic
             marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV
             DNA by PCR.

          -  Known or suspected active hepatitis C infection.

          -  Any medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol.

          -  Prior radiation therapy for bony lesions or plasmacytomas

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to corticosteroids, monoclonal
             antibodies or human proteins, or their excipients (refer to respective package inserts
             or Investigator's Brochure), or known sensitivity to mammalian-derived products. Known
             allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to trial drugs.

          -  Inability to comply with protocol/procedures.
