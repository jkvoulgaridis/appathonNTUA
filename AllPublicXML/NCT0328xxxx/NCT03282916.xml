      Anti-viral therapy in Alzheimer's disease will investigate the efficacy of treating patients
      with mild Alzheimer's disease with the U.S.A marketed generic anti-viral drug Valtrex
      (valacyclovir, 500mg oral tablet). Valacyclovir, titrated to 4 grams per day, repurposed to
      treat Alzheimer's disease, will be compared to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 mild
      AD patients (65 valacyclovir, 65 placebo) who test positive for herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1)
      or herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV2). The study will be a randomized, double-blind, 18-month
      Phase II proof of concept trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many viruses are latent for decades before being reactivated in the brain by stress, immune
      compromise, or other factors. After the initial oral infection, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1)
      becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglion and can later enter the brain via retrograde axonal
      transport, often targeting the temporal lobes.

      HSV1 can also enter the brain via olfactory neurons directly. HSV1 (oral herpes) and HSV2
      (genital herpes) are known to trigger amyloid aggregation and their DNA is commonly found in
      amyloid plaques. Anti-HSV drugs reduce Aβ and p-tau accumulation in brains of infected mice.
      HSV1 reactivation is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation in mice and may play a role in
      tau propagation across neurons. In humans, recurrent reactivation with newly produced HSV1
      particles, 'drop by drop,' may produce neuronal damage and eventually lead to
      neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, partly due to effects on amyloid
      and tau. Clinical studies show cognitive impairment in HSV seropositive patients in different
      patient groups and in healthy adults, and antiviral treatments show robust efficacy against
      peripheral HSV infection. The study team will conduct the first-ever clinical trial to
      directly address the long-standing viral etiology hypothesis of AD which posits that viruses,
      particularly the very common HSV1 and HSV2, may be etiologic or contribute to the pathology
      of AD. In patients with mild AD who test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2, the
      generic antiviral drug valacyclovir, repurposed as an anti-AD drug, will be compared at oral
      doses of 4 grams per day, to matching placebo in the treatment of 130 patients (65
      valacyclovir, 65 placebo) in a randomized, double-blind, 78-week Phase II proof of concept
      trial. Patients treated with valacyclovir are hypothesized to show smaller decline in
      cognition and functioning compared to placebo, and, using 18F-Florbetapir PET imaging, to
      show less amyloid accumulation than placebo over the 78-week trial. Through the use of tau
      PET imaging with the tracer 18F-MK-6240 at baseline and 78 weeks, patients treated with
      valacyclovir are hypothesized to show smaller increases in 18F-MK-6240 binding than patients
      treated with placebo from baseline to 78 weeks. Apolipoprotein E genotype at baseline, as
      well as changes in cortical thinning on structural MRI, olfactory identification deficits,
      and antiviral antibody titers from baseline to 78 weeks, will be evaluated in exploratory
      analyses. In patients who agree to lumbar puncture, plasma and CSF acyclovir will be assayed
      to establish the degree of CNS penetration of valacyclovir in mild AD, and the investigators
      will obtain CSF Aβ42, tau, p-tau for subset exploratory analyses with changes in outcome
      measures. If this trial is successful, the investigators will apply for funding to conduct a
      larger, multicenter, Phase III study using a study design that will be informed by the
      results of this Phase II trial. This innovative Phase II proof of concept trial clearly has
      exceptionally high reward potential for the treatment of AD.

          4. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 1 (mild dementia). Physician Evaluation

          5. A family member or other individual who is in contact with the patient and consents to
             serve as informant during the study Patient Report

          6. Patient retains capacity to consent for him/herself or retains the capacity to
             identify a surrogate who will consent on his/her behalf. Patient Report

          7. At screening, patients must test positive for serum antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2.
             Patients that test equivocal (index between 0.90-1.09; &lt; 0.90 is negative and &gt; 1.09
             is positive) will repeat the test within 6 weeks at a repeat visit. If the results are
             negative at the second test, the patient will not enter the study. If the results are
             equivocal or positive at the second test (first test was equivocal), we will enroll
             the patient in the study because &quot;equivocal&quot; indicates the presence of antibodies that
             do not reach the minimum threshold.

          8. Use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, and concomitant psychotropic
             medications (other than high dose benzodiazepines), will be permitted throughout the
             trial. Doses of these medications will need to be stable for at least 1 month prior to
             study entry. Any changes to the medication will be documented in the participant
             research chart. Medications given for other medical reasons, e.g., anti-diabetic or
             antihypertensive medications, will not be altered for the purposes of this trial and
             the patient's primary physician may adjust such medications as medically indicated
             throughout the trial. Details of concomitant medication use will be documented at all
             visits and will be available for statistical analysis.

          9. For patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment and CDR score of 0.5 (
             questionable dementia), if these patients have biomarkers of AD neuropathology with
             either a positive amyloid PET scan or positive findings for AD in CSF ( low ABeta42
             and high tau, p-tau protein levels) they will be eligible for the study. This applies
             to patients who already had an amyloid PET scan or lumbar puncture, prior to
             recruitment into the protocol.

             disease, multiple sclerosis, CNS infection, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic
             lateral sclerosis. Physician Evaluation

          8. Clinical stroke with residual neurological deficits. MRI findings of cerebrovascular
             disease (small infarcts, lacunes, periventricular disease) in the absence of clinical
             stroke with residual neurological deficits will not lead to exclusion. Physician
             Evaluation

          9. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, patients with active illness or
             metastases in the last 12 months will be excluded, but past history of successfully

             puncture. Physician Evaluation

         16. For MRI, metal implants and pacemaker, and claustrophobia such that the patient
             refuses MRI. In the investigators' experience, these exclusions occur in less than 5%
             of patients with mild AD. MRI is required for VALAD. Patient Report/ Physician
             Evaluation

         17. Radiation exposure in the prior 12 months that, together with 18F-Florbetapir and
             18F--MK-6240 PET, will be above the FDA annual radiation exposure threshold. This will
             be determined through study staff ( i.e. Principal Investigator, Study Physician)
             discussion with potential subjects at Screening, documenting inquiry about radiation
             history. If there is any history of additional radiation exposure in the past year; it
             will be reviewed with PET Center staff for their approval before proceeding. The
             combined radiation exposure from the maximum doses used for 18F-Florbetapir and
             18F-MK- 6240 is within the FDA limits for annual radiation exposure and the second
             scan in each patient will be done 18 months after the initial PET scan (for both
             radioligands). Patient Report/Physician Evaluation

         18. Severe vision or hearing impairment that would prevent the participant from performing
             the psychometric tests accurately. This will be a clinical determination by the study
             physician without formal testing or audiometry Physician Evaluation

         19. Olfaction component: current upper respiratory infection (patient tested as soon as
             this improves), current smoker &gt; 1 pack daily (past smoking has been shown not to
             affect UPSIT scores, UPSIT score &lt; 12/40 (10 out of 40 is scored by chance in this
             multiple-choice test) indicating congenital anosmia. In the investigators' experience,
             less than 3% of cases are excluded for having one or more of these exclusionary
             criteria. If a patient is excluded from the olfaction component, the patient will
             still be eligible for the main protocol and all other study procedures. Patient
