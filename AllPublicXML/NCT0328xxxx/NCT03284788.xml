  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot, feasibility study is to investigate the effects of an
      acceptance-based therapy weight loss intervention on adolescents, to receive feedback about
      the program, and to learn about potential changes we could make to improve the program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focus/writing groups will be conducted to assess perceived barriers and facilitators and
      identify components that the adolescents would like to see in a weight loss intervention in
      order to tailor an acceptance-based therapy (ABT) curriculum to adolescents.

      Participants will attend 2 baseline visits and adolescents will participate in an ABT weight
      loss intervention.

      The intervention will include 15 sessions over 6 months.

      A post-treatment visit will occur.
