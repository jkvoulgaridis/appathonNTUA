  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study of idasanutlin monotherapy in participants with
      hydroxyurea (HU)-resistant/intolerant Polycythemia vera (PV). The study will include two
      phases: initial phase and expansion phase. The initial phase will assess the safety and
      efficacy of idasanutlin monotherapy in ruxolitinib naïve and ruxolitinib-resistant or
      intolerant patients, respectively. If the initial phase shows promising results for
      ruxolitinib-resistant or intolerant patients, an expansion phase will be opened to further
      characterize the efficacy of idasanutlin.

    The Sponsor decided to discontinue the development of idasanutlin in the polycythemia vera

These include: early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, concentration issues, night sweats, itching, bone pain, fever, and weight loss. The participant provides a severity score for each additional symptom on a scale of 0 (none/absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). A tenth symptom, fatigue, is assessed using the &quot;worst&quot; fatigue item from the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI).</description>

    <description>All participants will receive 150 milligrams (mg) idasanutlin orally, once daily for 5 days, every 28 days, until treatment discontinuation or end of study (up to 2 years). Intra-participant dose-escalation to 200 mg daily for 5 days may be permitted after Cycle 3 for those who demonstrate no hematocrit (Hct) control and/or for those with inadequately controlled leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis in which the investigator judges that better control is important.</description>
