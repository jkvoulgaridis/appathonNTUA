  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of a generic
      Azelaic Acid Foam, 15% to the reference listed Finacea® (azelaic acid) Foam, 15% and to
      demonstrate therapeutic equivalence and safety of the two active foams in the treatment of
      moderate facial rosacea, and to demonstrate superiority of the Reference and Test products
      over the Vehicle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical azelaic acid is used to treat inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate
      rosacea. Other topical therapies and oral antibiotics are also used to treat rosacea
      symptoms. Finacea® (azelaic acid) Foam, 15% contains azelaic acid, a naturally occurring
      saturated dicarboxylic acid that has proven anti-inflammatory effects, as well as
      anti-keratinizing and antimicrobial actions.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in the Inflammatory Lesions (Papules and Pustules) Counts at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All facial papules, pustules, and nodules, located above the jaw line and extending to the hairline, were counted. When counting facial lesions, lesions present on the nose were included. The total count for each lesion type was recorded and the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) were calculated. A papule with a pustule on its apex was counted as a pustule. Counts of nodules and cysts were reported separately and not included in the inflammatory counts. Papule defined as inflammatory lesion; small (≤5 mm in diameter), solid palpable lesion, usually with inflamed elevation of the skin that does not contain pus. Pustule defined as inflammatory lesion; small (≤5 mm in diameter), inflamed skin swelling that is filled with pus. Cyst and nodule defined as palpable solid or soft lesion &gt;5 mm in diameter.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Success Based on IGE Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success defined as an Investigator's Global Evaluation (IGE) score at Week 12 of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Any other outcome was considered a failure. Participants who were discontinued prematurely from the study due to lack of treatment effect after at least 8 weeks of compliant treatment were considered as treatment failures. The IGE score was based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe).</description>

        <description>All facial papules, pustules, and nodules, located above the jaw line and extending to the hairline, were counted. When counting facial lesions, lesions present on the nose were included. The total count for each lesion type was recorded and the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) were calculated. A papule with a pustule on its apex was counted as a pustule. Counts of nodules and cysts were reported separately and not included in the inflammatory counts. Papule defined as inflammatory lesion; small (≤5 mm in diameter), solid palpable lesion, usually with inflamed elevation of the skin that does not contain pus. Pustule defined as inflammatory lesion; small (≤5 mm in diameter), inflamed skin swelling that is filled with pus. Cyst and nodule defined as palpable solid or soft lesion &gt;5 mm in diameter.</description>

If participant discontinued between 8 and 12 weeks of treatment due to lack of treatment, last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used to impute the number of lesions.
