      This study aims to survey the drug disposal methods of orthopedic foot and ankle patients
      with excess pain medication following and operation. The study is a randomized control trial
      comparing the use of FDA approved at home disposal methods to current clinical methods of
      recommending disposal at medication drop off locations.
