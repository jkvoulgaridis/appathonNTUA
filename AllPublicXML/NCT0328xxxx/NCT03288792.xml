  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this image acquisition study is to compare, in a Reader Study, the RI8 system
      used in conjunction with a conventional mammography to mammography alone, and to determine
      whether the addition of supplementary RI8 result will improve ROC area under the curve. The
      study is prospective, multi-center, sequential, control trial with the woman serving as her
      own control. Women determined to have heterogeneously or extremely dense breast based on her
      previous mammogram and are undergoing routine screening mammography at one of the clinical
      sites assigned for this study will be eligible to join the study.

        B. Subjects who are asymptomatic and scheduled to undergo routine screening mammography.

        OR

        C. Subjects scheduled for image-guided needle biopsy as a result of findings obtained
        during standard of care imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound and/or MRI) performed
        at the clinical site that participates in the study.
