  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/II, open label, multi-center, randomized study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy-based
      treatment combinations in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic G/GEJ
      cancer (hereafter referred to as gastric cancer) and esophageal cancer. Two cohorts of
      patients with gastric cancer have been enrolled in parallel in this study: the second-line
      (2L) Gastric Cancer Cohort consists of patients with gastric cancer who have progressed after
      receiving a platinum-containing or fluoropyrimide-containing chemotherapy regimen in the
      first-line setting, and the first-line (1L) Gastric Cancer Cohort consists of patients with
      gastric cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy in this setting. In each cohort,
      eligible patients will be assigned to one of several treatment arms. Additionally, a cohort
      of patients with esophageal cancer who have not received prior systemic treatment for their
      disease will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients will be randomized to chemotherapy
      or the combination of chemotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.
