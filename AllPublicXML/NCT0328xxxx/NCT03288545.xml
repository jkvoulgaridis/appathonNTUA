  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an experimental drug (enfortumab vedotin) alone and with different
      combinations of anticancer therapies. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)
      that is used to treat patients with cancer of the urinary system (urothelial cancer). This
      type of cancer includes cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra. Some parts of
      the study will look at locally-advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer, which means the
      cancer has spread to nearby tissues or to other areas of the body. Other parts of the study
      will look at muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which is cancer at an earlier stage that
      has spread into the muscle wall of the bladder. This study will look at the side effects of
      enfortumab vedotin alone and with other anticancer therapies. A side effect is a response to
      a drug that is not part of the treatment effect. This study will also test if the cancer
      shrinks with the different treatment combinations.

      This study will examine the safety and anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin (EV) given
      intravenously as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer therapies as first line
      (1L) and second line (2L) treatment for patients with urothelial cancer. The primary goal of
      the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of enfortumab vedotin alone
      and in combination with pembrolizumab and/or chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in
      multiple parts:

      Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer:

        -  Dose escalation

        -  Expansion

             -  Part 1: Cohorts A and Optional B

             -  Part 2: Cohorts D, E, and Optional F

             -  Part 3: Cohort G.

        -  Randomized Cohort K

             -  EV Monotherapy Arm

             -  EV Combination Arm

      Muscle invasive bladder cancer:

        -  Cohort H
