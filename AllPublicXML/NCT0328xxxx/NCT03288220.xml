      Background:

      When people have a stroke, they often have difficulty moving their arms and hands.
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve how well people with and without stroke
      can move their arms and hands. But the effects of TMS are minor, and it doesn t work for
      everyone. Researchers want to study how to time brain stimulation so that the effects are
      more consistent.

      Objective:

      To understand how the brain responds to transcranial magnetic stimulation so that treatments
      for people with stroke can be improved.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older who had a stroke at least 6 months ago

      Healthy volunteers ages 50 and older

      Design:

      Participants will have up to 5 visits.

      At visit 1, participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.
      Participants with stroke will also have TMS and surface electromyography (sEMG).

      For TMS, a brief electrical current will pass through a wire coil on the scalp. Participants
      may hear a click and feel a pull. Muscles may twitch. Participants may be asked to do simple
      movements during TMS.

      For sEMG, small electrodes will be attached to the skin and muscle activity will be recorded.

      At visit 2, participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They will lie on a table
      that slides into a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will get earplugs for the
      loud noise.

      At visit 3, participants will have TMS, sEMG, and electroencephalography (EEG). For EEG,
      small electrodes on the scalp will record brainwaves. Participants will sit still, watch a
      movie, or do TMS.

      Participants may be asked to have 2 extra visits to redo procedures.

      Study Description: We will study if corticospinal excitability (primary outcome measure)
      varies across different sensorimotor alpha EEG waveform oscillation phases in healthy older
      adults and chronic stroke patients. Sensorimotor cortical neuronal spiking is highest at
      sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs and lowest at sensorimotor alpha oscillation peaks,
      suggesting that cortical excitability is higher at sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs
      relative to peaks. We will address these questions using closed-loop TMS. Based on this
      previous work, we hypothesize that corticospinal excitability (primary outcome measure) will
      be increased at sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs compared to peaks in healthy older
      adults (Experiment 1), and chronic stroke patients (Experiment 2).

      Objectives: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a potential adjunct therapy for
      post-stroke neurorehabilitation. So far, it has been customarily applied uncoupled from brain
      oscillatory activity (as measured using EEG waveforms), resulting in variability in the
      biological response to each stimulus, small effect sizes and significant inter-individual
      variability. Brain oscillatory activity (i.e., EEG waveform oscillatory activity) in the
      alpha band (8-12 Hz) is linked to cortical inhibition, motor function and cognitive
      processing, and therefore influences brain function. For example, corticospinal excitability
      (as measured with TMS) in healthy humans varies depending on the sensorimotor alpha
      oscillatory phase during which TMS is delivered: corticospinal excitability is higher when
      TMS is delivered during sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs (i.e., maximum surface
      negativity) and lower when TMS is delivered during sensorimotor alpha oscillation peaks
      (i.e., maximum surface positivity). We recently replicated this result in young healthy
      adults. We therefore aim to extend these findings to two new populations: healthy older
      adults (Experiment 1) and patients with chronic stroke (Experiment 2). Previous studies have
      demonstrated that older adults exhibit significant differences in motor cortical physiology
      compared to young adults, so Experiment 1 will be performed to determine whether an
      association between sensorimotor alpha oscillatory phase and corticospinal excitability is
      present in healthy aging. Additionally, Experiment 2 will be performed to determine if the
      expected association between sensorimotor alpha oscillatory phase and corticospinal
      excitability is also present after chronic stroke. Importantly, acquiring information
      regarding how the aged and damaged brain respond to EEG waveform oscillation-dependent
      closed-loop TMS will be critical for developing more effective TMS-based (i.e., closed-loop)
      interventions. In both experiments, TMS delivery will be timed to specific sensorimotor alpha
      oscillation phases. We expect the results of this work to provide new insights into how
      corticospinal excitability is affected by sensorimotor alpha oscillation phase in the aged
      and post-stroke brain, which could lead to more effective use of sensorimotor alpha
      oscillation-dependent neuromodulatory TMS protocols in the future.
