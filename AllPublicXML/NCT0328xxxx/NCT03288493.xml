    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of the study is comprised of an open-label, single ascending dose (SAD), multiple
      cohort study; a multiple dose cycle administration cohort study; and a combination
      administration study of P-BCMA-101 autologous T stem cell memory (Tscm) CAR-T cells in
      patients with relapsed / refractory MM. Followed by a Phase 2, open-label, efficacy and
      safety study. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.

      Phase 1 follows a 3 + 3 design of dose-escalating cohorts. Phase 2 of the study is an
      open-label multi-center efficacy and safety study. After a patient enrolls, leukapheresis
      will be performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells which will be sent to a
      manufacturing site to produce P-BCMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be returned to the
      investigational site and, after a standard chemotherapy based conditioning regimen, will be
      administered to the patient across 1-3 infusions, with or without combination therapy.
      Treated patients will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response.
      Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.

    <description>P-BCMA-101 is an autologous, principally Tscm, CAR-T cell product (also called called a CARTyrin T cell product) targeting the myeloma selective protein BCMA. P-BCMA-101 cells are produced using a non-viral vector carrying the gene for an anti-BCMA Centyrin-based (small, fully human binding domain, designed to increase T cell persistence and decrease exhaustion) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Secondary to the large carrying capacity of the non-viral vector, P-BCMA-101 cells carry two additional genes, a selection gene used to manufacture a purified product and a &quot;safety switch&quot; gene to allow the cells to be eliminated if desired. Rimiducid (safety switch activator) may be administered as indicated.</description>
