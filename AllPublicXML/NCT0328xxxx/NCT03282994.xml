      The purpose of this study is to establish that controlled localized cooling with the Dermal
      Cooling System will elicit an improvement in the cosmetic appearance of benign superficial
      lesions associated with common skin conditions that are currently being treated with
      cryosurgical methods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Subject has benign superficial lesion(s) associated with common skin conditions
             amenable to cryosurgical treatment including, for example, psoriasis, acne, rosacea,
             and sebaceous hyperplasia.

          3. Subject is willing to have up to 40 test sites treated.

          4. Subject has read and signed a written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Physician prescribed procedures in the area of intended treatment in the previous 6
             months (e.g., photodynamic therapy, intense pulsed light therapy, laser surgery).

          2. Dermatological conditions (e.g. vitiligo, open wounds, infection, pre-cancerous or
             malignant lesions) in the location of the treatment sites that would, in the
             professional opinion of the investigator, potentially pose an increased risk to the
             subject.

          3. History of melanoma.

          4. Known history of illness or adverse reaction to cold insult (e.g., cryoglobulinemia,
             cold urticaria, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, Reynaud's disease).

          5. History of abnormal wound healing or abnormal scarring

          6. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the study requirements.

          7. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in the study.

          8. Subject is lactating.

          9. Current enrollment in a clinical study of any other unapproved investigational drug or
             device.

         10. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the
             investigator, potentially affect response or participation in this clinical study, or
             would pose an increased or unacceptable risk to the subject.
