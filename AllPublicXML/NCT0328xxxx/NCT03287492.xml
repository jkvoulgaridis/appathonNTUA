  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well information materials work in helping communication between
      physicians and participants with cancer that has spread to other places in the body and their
      caregivers. Approaches that encourage participants to actively participate and ask
      appropriate questions during their visit may be important to enhance their understanding of
      their illness and empower them to make important decisions regarding their medical care.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare patients' perception of helpfulness in communicating with their physicians
      between a question prompt sheet (QPS) and a general information sheet (GIS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare caregivers' perception of helpfulness in communicating with their physicians
      between the QPS and the GIS.

      II. To examine the level of patients' and caregivers' overall satisfaction with the
      consultation with the use of the QPS versus the GIS.

      III. To examine physicians' views about the information material and overall satisfaction
      with the use of the QPS versus the GIS.

      IV. To explore how the use of QPS affects the average speaking time of patient or physician
      during the consultation visit.

      V. To establish demographic and clinical predictors of patients' perception of helpfulness of
      a QPS.

      VI. To examine the overall patients' preference between the QPS and GIS in an open label
      phase.

      VII. To compare the change in patient anxiety state with the use of the QPS versus the GIS.

      VIII. To explore the factors underlying patients' preferences for the QPS or GIS.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive QPS and answer questions from physician. At follow up visit,
      participants receive both QPS and GIS.

      GROUP II: Participants receive GIS and answer questions from physician. At follow up visit,
      participants receive both QPS and GIS.

    <description>Standard statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, range, frequency and percentage will be summarized for variables of interest, such as patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, anxiety state, patients'/caregivers' views about the information material, patients' satisfaction, physicians' views about the information material and consultation, patients' preferences for information, patient preferences for level of involvement in decision-making and patients' overall preference between the question prompt sheet (QPS) and the general information sheet (GIS) at the follow-up visit. Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, whichever appropriate, will be used to compare continuous variables of interest between the QPS and the GIS. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, whichever appropriate, will be used to test for associations between categorical variables and helpfulness of information material.</description>
