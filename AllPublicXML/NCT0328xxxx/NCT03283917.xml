      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of daratumumab, ixazomib, and
      dexamethasone in treating participants with amyloid light chain amyloidosis. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as daratumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixazomib and dexamethasone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone
      may be effective in treating participants with light chain amyloidosis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To confirm the safety and tolerability of daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone (DId)
      in patients with amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis.

      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of daratumumab, ixazomib, and
      dexamethasone in subjects with AL amyloidosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the hematologic response rate of daratumumab, ixazomib, and dexamethasone in
      patients with AL amyloidosis.

      II. To determine cardiac and renal organ response rate of daratumumab, ixazomib, and
      dexamethasone in patients with AL amyloidosis.

      III. To determine time to next therapy. IV. To determine the time to response. V. To
      determine the duration of response. VI. To determine progression free survival (PFS). VII. To
      determine overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dexamethasone.

      Participants receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 3.5-6.5 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22 of courses 1-2, on days 1 and 15 of courses 3-6, and on day 1 of courses 7-12.
      Participants also receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, and dexamethasone IV
      over 15 minutes or PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every
      90 days for 24 months.
