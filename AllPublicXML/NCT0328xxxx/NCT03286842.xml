  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-centre phase IIIb study will assess the effectiveness, benefits and
      potential harms in the use of olaparib monotherapy treatment for patients with HER2-ve
      metastatic breast cancer associated with germline or somatic breast cancer susceptibility
      gene (gBRCA1/2 or sBRCA1/2) mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase IIIb, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      clinical effectiveness in a real-world setting of olaparib monotherapy in patients with
      confirmed germline or somatic breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA1/2 or sBRCA1/2)
      mutations. This study will generate additional data to support other olaparib studies, which
      may help inform and guide clinical practice. Physician defined the progression-free survival
      (PFS) for gBRCAm patients is the primary outcome measure. Based on the prevalence of gBRCA1/2
      mutations, it is estimated that up to 1400 patients may require screening in order to
      identify 250 gBRCA mutated patients and 20 sBRCA mutated patients. Patients will be
      administered two olaparib 150mg tablets in morning and evening of every day after a light
      meal. Dose reductions may be required for olaparib treatment related toxicities. Patients
      should continue to receive study treatment until documented physician-defined disease
      progression as assessed by the investigator (gBRCA mutated patients), RECIST1.1 disease
      progression (sBRCA mutated patients) or unacceptable toxicity, or for as long as they do not
      meet any other discontinuation criteria. A positive benefit/risk profile is expected and no
      ethical issues are identified from exposing patients to olaparib within the planned clinical
      study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. For patients
             aged &lt;20 years and screened in Japan, a written informed consent should be obtained
             from the patient and his or her legally acceptable representative.

          2. Patients must be ≥18 years of age.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2-ve breast cancer with evidence of
             metastatic disease. Patients can have either TNBC (defined as oestrogen receptor and
             progesterone receptor negative [immunohistochemistry nuclear staining &lt;1%] and HER2-ve
             [immunohistochemistry 0, 1+ or 2+ and/or in situ hybridization nonamplified with ratio
             less than 2.0]) or oestrogen receptor / progesterone receptor positive breast cancer
             as long as they are HER2-ve.

          4. Documented BRCA1/2 status

               -  To be regarded as BRCA1/2 (+ve), the patient must have a mutation that is
                  predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be
                  detrimental / lead to loss of function). Mutations that are not clearly
                  pathogenic may be assessed by a committee of genetic specialists to adjudicate if
                  the patient is eligible.

               -  Patients with tBRCA mutations: must be confirmed by a validated method (e.g.
                  results from a CLIA-certified laboratory or CE-IVD device)

          5. Prior treatment with a taxane or an anthracycline in either an adjuvant (may include
             neoadjuvant) or metastatic breast cancer treatment setting.

          6. Patients should have received no more than two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens
             in the metastatic setting. If a patient has oestrogen receptor and/or progesterone
             receptor positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer and has completed a prior
             line of hormonal treatment, then if the current or currently planned choice of
             treatment for the patient does not include a hormonal treatment then they would be a
             suitable patient to enter the study. Previous endocrine therapy could be in either an
             adjuvant or a metastatic setting and include endocrine therapy in combination with a
             targeted agent such as a CDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitor.

          7. Be considered suitable, by the Investigator, for further treatment with single-agent
             chemotherapy for the metastatic disease

          8. Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 14 days prior
             to administration of study treatment as defined below:

               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL with no blood transfusion in the past 28 days

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless the
                  patient has documented Gilbert's Syndrome

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT))
                  / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT)) ≤
                  2.5 x institutional ULN unless liver metastases are present in which case they
                  must be ≤ 5x ULN

               -  Patients must have creatinine clearance (CrCl) estimated using the Cockcroft-
                  Gault equation of ≥ 51 mL/min or 24 hour urine test may be done if standard of
                  care:

             Estimated CrCl = (140-age [years]) x weight (kg) (x F)a serum creatinine (mg/dL) x 72

             a- where F=0.85 for females and F=1 for males

          9. Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks

         10. Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing
             potential: negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment
             and confirmed prior to treatment on Day 1

             Postmenopausal is defined as (at least one criterion met):

               -  amenorrhoeic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments

               -  luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal
                  range for women under 50

               -  radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago

               -  chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1 year interval since last menses

               -  surgical sterilisation (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

         11. Women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must
             agree to the use of two highly effective forms of contraception in combination from
             the signing of the informed consent, throughout the period of taking study treatment
             and for at least 1 month after last dose of study drug, or they must totally/truly
             abstain from any form of sexual intercourse.

         12. Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose
             of olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of
             childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly
             effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential.

         13. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations for greater than
             6 months.
