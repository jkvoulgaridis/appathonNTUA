  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy, safety and tolerability of ASP6294 in
      female participants with Bladder Pain Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis (BPS/IC). This study
      will also investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ASP6294 in

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Average Mean Daily Pain (MDP) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record their MDP each day in the evening into an e-diary. The MDP is the average pain experienced over the past 24 hours. The average MDP is the mean of daily assessments of MDP in the week prior to the visit with at least 5 recordings in that week. MDP is measured using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no bladder pain) to 10 (worst imaginable bladder pain). A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Average Worst Daily Pain (WDP) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record their WDP each day in the evening into an e-diary. The WDP is the worst pain experienced over the past 24 hours. The average WDP is the mean of daily assessments of WDP in the week prior to the visit with at least 5 recordings in that week. WDP is measured using an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no bladder pain) to 10 (worst imaginable bladder pain). A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Voiding Frequency per 24 hours at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean voiding frequency is the mean of the recordings of voiding frequency in the electronic micturition diary in the week prior to the visit with at least 2 days recorded in that week. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Level 3 or 4 Urgency Episodes (Based on Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale [PPIUS]) per 24 hours at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The perceived level of urinary urgency is measured using PPIUS. For each micturition episode, participant will be asked to rate the degree of associated urgency severity according to PPIUS. PPIUS is a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 = no urgency (participant felt no need to empty the bladder, but did so for other reasons), 1 = mild urgency (participant could postpone voiding as long as necessary, without fear of wetting herself), 2 = moderate urgency (participant could postpone voiding for a short while, without fear of wetting herself), 3 = severe urgency (participant could not postpone voiding, had to rush to the toilet in order not to wet herself), and 4 = urge incontinence (participant leaked before arriving to the toilet). Mean number of Level 3 or 4 urgency episodes is the mean of recordings of Level 3 or 4 urgency episodes in 3-day electronic micturition diary in the week prior to visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bladder Pain/ Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Score (BPIC-SS) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BPIC-SS is a psychometrically validated and reliable questionnaire with 8 questions concerning bladder pain over the previous 7 days. Question (Q) 1 to Q5 assess urinary symptoms (how often urinated because of pain, need to urinate just after previous urination, urination to avoid pain, pressure in the bladder, and pain in the bladder) and are rated 0 (never) to 4 (always). Q6 and Q7 assess the impact of bladder pain (bothered by frequent urination during daytime and nighttime) and are rated 0 (not at all) to 4 (a great deal). Q8 assesses the worst pain on a 0 (no bladder pain) to 10 (worst possible bladder pain) NRS. The BPIC-SS total score is the sum of the individual question scores and range from 0 to 38, with higher scores indicating a worse situation. A score of 19 or more represents moderate/severe disease activity. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in BPIC-SS Worst Bladder Pain (Question 8) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BPIC-SS is a psychometrically validated and reliable questionnaire with 8 questions concerning bladder pain over the previous 7 days. Q8 of BPIC-SS assesses the worst pain on a 0 (no bladder pain) to 10 (worst possible bladder pain) NRS. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Moderately Improved or Better Grade on the Global Response Assessment (GRA) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported 7 grade GRA is used to evaluate a participant's clinical condition relative to baseline. The GRA reads: As compared to when the participant started the study, how would the participant rate the participant's overall symptoms now? The 7 GRA grades are &quot;markedly worse&quot;, &quot;moderately worse&quot;, &quot;slightly worse&quot;, &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;slightly improved&quot;, &quot;moderately improved&quot; or &quot;markedly improved&quot;. Percentage of participants with a successful GRA response (defined as the response of &quot;moderately improved&quot; or better [&quot;markedly improved&quot;] will be reported.</description>

                  post-pelvic surgery, post-hysterectomy) that may complicate diagnosis and the
                  evaluation of pelvic pain and urinary symptoms. Note: A history of a Cesarean
                  section is not a reason for exclusion.

                  bladder function (e.g., neurogenic bladder, systemic or central neurological
                  disease, such as Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).

               -  subject has a known current lower urinary tract malignancy. In case of positive

                  last 6 months and malignancy has been adequately ruled out by the investigator
                  according to local diagnostic procedures, the subject does not have to be

          -  Subject has a known current psychiatric condition, mental incapacity, language barrier
