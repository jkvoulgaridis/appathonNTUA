    <textblock>
      This study will assess the retention rate of perampanel when given as monotherapy or first
      adjunctive therapy in participants with partial-onset seizures or primary generalized tonic
      clonic seizures. The study consists of 4 periods: a Screening Period (to start no earlier
      than 6 weeks before the first dose of study drug), a Titration Period (up to 13 weeks), a
      Maintenance Period (39 weeks), and a Follow-Up Period (4 weeks).

    <time_frame>Up to 39 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure frequency data will be collected in participant diaries by participants or by the guardian/legally authorized representative, and the data will be reviewed by the investigators. Seizure-free status is defined as no incidence of seizure. Partial seizures occur when abnormal electrical activity begins in only one part of the brain and include (1) simple partial seizures, where a participant does not lose consciousness and may experience muscle jerking or stiffening, and (2) complex partial seizures, where a participant loses awareness. SGS are disturbances that spread to both sides of the brain after a partial seizure has already begun and happen when a burst of electrical activity in a limited area (the partial seizure) spreads throughout the brain. PGTCS are disturbances in the functioning of both sides of the brain that are caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately.</description>

    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug).

    <description>Perampanel will be administered orally once daily (QD) at bedtime. At the beginning of the Titration Period, oral perampanel will start at a dose of 2 milligrams (mg) QD. Doses of perampanel will then be up titrated in increments of 2 mg at no less than 2-week intervals according to the investigator's judgment. At the 4 mg dose, the investigator will confirm whether further dose escalation is needed based on participant response and tolerability. The investigator may adjust dosing further or leave the participant at 4 mg. The maximum dose is 12 mg. During the 39-week Maintenance Period, participants will continue to receive the perampanel dose level that was administered at the end of the Titration Period.</description>

             PGTCS. Either of the following must have occurred to support an epilepsy diagnosis:

               1. At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours
                  apart

               2. One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure with Electroencephalography (EEG) evidence of

             been treated with stable doses of monotherapy with an anti-epileptic drug (AED) for 8
             weeks prior to Visit 2 (Week 0), have not previously received adjunctive AED
             treatment, and must, in the investigator's judgement, be in need of initial adjunctive
             therapy after failure to control seizures with AED monotherapy, at the optimal dose
             and duration.

          -  Participants who receive perampanel as monotherapy, who were newly diagnosed

             as monotherapy if, in the investigator's judgment, the participant may benefit from a
             change in monotherapy treatment. Participants must not have previously received
             adjunctive AED treatment.

          -  If antidepressants or antianxiety drugs are used, participants must be on a stable

                  discontinuation For sites outside of the European Union, it is permissible that
                  if a highly effective method of contraception is not appropriate or acceptable to
                  the participant, then the participant must agree to use a medically acceptable
                  method of contraception, i.e, double barrier methods of contraception such as
                  condom plus diaphragm or cervical/vault cap with spermicide.
