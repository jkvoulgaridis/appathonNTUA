      palbociclib)

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of SAR439859
           based on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observance in monotherapy (Part A), and in
           combination with palbociclib (Part C)

      Dose Expansion: Part B (SAR439859 monotherapy)

        -  To assess antitumor activity by Objective Response Rate (ORR) at the SAR439859
           recommended dose in monotherapy

      Duration of the study, per patient, will include eligibility period (screening period) of up
      to 4 weeks (28 days), treatment period (at least 1 cycle [28 days] of study treatment), and
      end of treatment (EOT) visit after the last study treatment administration (i.e. at least 30
      days post last treatment or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever
      is earlier). The expected enrollment period is approximately 36-40 months.

Administration of higher dose of SAR439859 (with standard palbociclib dose) to subsequent patients will be based on occurrence of DLTs at initial and subsequent doses, until MAD of SAR439859 is reached. Drugs will be administered in 28-day cycle (palbociclib will be administered for 21 days of cycle).
