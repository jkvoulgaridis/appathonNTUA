  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effect of different conditions of auditory cueing and music on
      walking quality and perceived fatigue in persons with multiple sclerosis compared to healthy
      controls. The study extends over a four session period, each session lasting maximally 1h30
      minutes The experimental conditions include participants walking to music and metronome (at
      different tempi) for 3minutes and 15 seconds per condition, with a rest period of 3 minutes
      in between each condition. Non-invasive equipment will be used. participants are equipped
      with sensors (watch-like straps at the wrists, ankles and across the chest) and are given
      wireless headphones.
