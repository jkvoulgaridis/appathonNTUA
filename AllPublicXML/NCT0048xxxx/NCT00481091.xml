  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of
      ABT-263 under two different dosing schedules with the objective of defining the dose limiting
      toxicity and maximum tolerated dose. The Phase 2a portion of the study will evaluate ABT-263
      at the defined recommended Phase 2 dose to obtain additional safety information and a
      preliminary assessment of efficacy. The Extension Study portion will allow active subjects to
      continue to receive ABT-263 for up to 9 years after the last subject transitions with less
      frequent study evaluations.
