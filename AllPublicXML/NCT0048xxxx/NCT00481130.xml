      ASTOR's primary purpose is to enroll families and patients with a history of Alport syndrome
      in a central registry. The information we gather will be used as a basis for studies designed
      to test potential treatments for Alport syndrome. ASTOR also aims to provide patients,
      families and physicians with the most up-to-date information about Alport syndrome.

      The University of Minnesota's Department of Pediatrics has created the Alport Syndrome
      Treatments and Outcomes Registry (ASTOR). ASTOR's primary purpose is to enroll families and
      patients with a history of Alport syndrome in a central registry. The information we gather
      will be used as a basis for studies designed to test potential treatments for Alport
      syndrome. ASTOR also aims to provide patients, families and physicians with the most
      up-to-date information about Alport syndrome.

      You can help doctors learn more about Alport syndrome and test possible treatments for the
      disease by enrolling in ASTOR. Since Alport syndrome is a rare disease it is essential for
      ASTOR to enroll as many patients as possible. Together, you and others facing the challenges
      of Alport syndrome can provide valuable information that will help doctors better understand
      the disease and in turn, help patients with Alport syndrome now and in the future.
