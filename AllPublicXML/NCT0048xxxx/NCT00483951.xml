    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate volunteers 18 years of age and older to see if they qualify for one
      of NHLBI s research studies. Tests include the following:

        -  General medical evaluation, which may include blood tests, chest x-ray,
           electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (heart ultrasound).

        -  Other tests as appropriate, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiac computed
           tomography (CT scan of the heart), nuclear stress test and echocardiography stress test.

        -  X-ray contrast studies of the heart and blood vessels. (These may be excluded in
           patients with kidney risk factors.)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a screening protocol. This protocol allows two functions: 1) the protocol allows
      physicians in the Suburban/NHLBI Cardiovascular Imaging program to evaluate patients referred
      to the program with clinically indicated studies and research studies. 2) It is also designed
      to determine if patients may be suitable candidates for one of our NHLBI research protocols.

      Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age referred for possible cardiovascular
      disease will be enrolled in the protocol for a period of one year. At one year, patients will
      either be: 1) transferred to one of our specific research MRI or CT protocols, 2) removed
      from the screening protocol and made inactive, or 3) re-enrolled on the screening protocol
      with the patient s consent.

    <intervention_name>Toshiba Aquilion ONE CT</intervention_name>
    <description>The Toshiba Aquilion ONE CT system is currently being used for studies in both general CT radiology and CT cardiac imaging. One of the unique aspects of the Aquilion ONE CT system is its ability to acquire whole organ volume images in a single rotation by utilizing an x-ray detector that is configured as 320 detector rows with a 0.5 mm width, providing a z-axis coverage of 16 cm of anatomy. In line with the evolutionary changes to CT systems, the Aquilion ONE will be upgraded with new technology that will expand its capabilities. The changes being made to the Aquilion ONE will provide enhancements to image acquisition capabilities, reduce ionizing radiation dose, and improve subject access to the system. All of these features assist in enhancing the safety of the currently installed Aquilion ONE CT system.</description>

    <description>Investigational or research MRI coils may be used in the protocol. The coils are noninvasive devices external to the body. The coils act as antennae to receive small radiofrequency signals out of the body. Coils of the type we use are used daily in clinical MRI practice.</description>
