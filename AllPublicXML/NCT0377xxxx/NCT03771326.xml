  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of insulin secretion by kisspeptin is observed in mouse, pig, rat, and human islets
      in vitro and in rats, mice and monkeys in vivo, but its mechanism is not fully clear. The
      present study was designed to investigate the role of KP-10 on insulin secretion in adult
      healthy and obese men with insulin resistance. The aim of selection of obese persons for the
      present study was to investigate the effect of acute KP-10 administration in a metabolically
      challenged condition where the pancreatic beta cells are already highly activated. The
      long-term objective of this study was to understand the physiological role of kisspeptin
      signalling in the regulation of insulin secretion in human health and disease.

    <time_frame>Each participant was studied up to 4 hours. Blood samples from each individual was collected for 30 minutes pre and 120 minutes post KP-10 administration, at 30 minutes interval.</time_frame>
    <description>The blood samples were obtained and analysed for insulin by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay to know the differential response of insulin secretion to exogenous kisspeptin-10 administration in healthy and obese men.</description>

    <description>To the 7 obese men, kisspeptin-10 was intravenously administered (0.5µg/kg BW, prepared under sterile conditions), as a bolus in a volume of 1ml. Blood samples from all the individuals were collected for 30 minutes pre and 120 minutes post-KP-10 administration, at 30 minutes interval. The obtained blood was centrifuged and the plasma insulin was measured by ELISA.</description>
