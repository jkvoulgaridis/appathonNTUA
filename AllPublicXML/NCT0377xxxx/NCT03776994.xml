  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted monovalent VEE VLP Vaccine in healthy adults (ages 18‒50 years)
      when administered via intramuscular (IM) injection at escalating doses of 2 μg, 10 μg, and 20
      μg as a 2-dose primary series (Day 0, Day 28) with a Day 140 booster dose. The secondary
      objective of the study is to evaluate immunogenicity of the vaccine at the aforementioned
      time points

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate safety and immunogenicity of both
      non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted VEE VLP vaccine in three dose groups (2 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg)
      given as a 2-dose primary series IM injection (Days 0 and Week 4 [Day 28]) followed by a
      booster dose injection (Week 20 [Day 140]). Each group will consist of 30 subjects, for a
      total of 90 study subjects. Each group of 30 subjects will be randomized to receive either
      non-adjuvanted vaccine (Subgroup A; n=15) or adjuvanted vaccine (Subgroup B; n=15). Subjects
      will be blinded to receiving the non-adjuvanted versus adjuvanted vaccine, but will not be
      blinded to the vaccine dosage. Enrollment will utilize a sentinel dose design, with only one
      subject receiving a vaccine dose the initial day, 2 subjects the following day, and 3
      subjects the subsequent day, before proceeding with further enrollments in that group.
      Subjects in each Group will be randomized to receive the vaccine dose either without adjuvant
      (Subgroup A) or with adjuvant (Subgroup B).

    <masking_description>Subjects will be blinded to receiving the non-adjuvanted versus adjuvanted vaccines, but will not be blinded to the vaccine dosage. Vaccines will be brought into the subject rooms in a concealed container, and subjects will be asked to turn away from the dosing arm so that the SRI Clinical Trials' Unit (CTU) staff can prepare and administer the dose. Subjects may be unblinded if subject experiences a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and upon notification to the data review team, called Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects reporting solicited local adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study duration of 44 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>• The solicited local adverse events (SLAEs) are specified and collected in daily diary questionnaires for 1 week after each vaccination in each arm of the study (Days 0-7, 28-35, and 140-147). These SLAEs include pain, tenderness, induration or swelling, and erythema. Symptoms are counted once if subjects experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number of local symptoms is the total of one or more local symptom at any severity. The severity of the SLAEs will be graded as Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), Severe (Grade 3) or Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4). SLAEs will be characterized according to the &quot;Toxicity grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventative vaccine trials&quot; FDA Guidance for Industry (Sept 2007). The frequency of SLAEs will each be expressed as the number of subjects experiencing these adverse events for the 3 vaccinations within each of the 6 arms of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female between the ages of 18 and 50.

          2. Understanding of the requirements of the study, provision of written informed consent,
             and agreement to abide by the study restrictions.

          3. In good general health (no chronic health condition) and an acceptable medical
             history, physical examination and screening laboratory studies within 28 days of
             enrollment on the study (specific laboratory requirements are listed below).

          4. Negative urine screen for drugs of abuse at screening.

          5. Body weight ≥ 49.8 kg and ≤ 110 kg. If body weight is over 110 kg, then body mass
             index (BMI) will be considered and must be &lt; 40 kg/m2. The National Institutes of
             Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute BMI calculator will be used to make
             this determination
             (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi-m.htm).

          6. Available for entire clinical study duration of 44 weeks.

          7. Individual agrees to not receive non-study vaccines during study unless urgent medical
             indication (i.e., tetanus booster, rabies vaccine).

          8. Females must be of non-childbearing potential or agree to use two types of an
             acceptable form of FDA-approved contraception through the duration of the study and
             must not be pregnant or lactating. If volunteers are sexually abstinent, they are not
             required to use additional forms of birth control. Non-childbearing potential is
             defined as being post-menopausal (absence of menses for 12 consecutive months not
             caused by drugs or hormones), status after bilateral tubal ligation for at least 1

             Depo-Provera®, Norplant®, Nova Ring®, Ortho Evra® (birth control patch), and oral
             contraceptives. Absence of pregnancy in women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) is
             indicated by a negative history of current pregnancy, a negative urine pregnancy test
             at screening, and a negative urine pregnancy test performed within 1 day before each
             administration of study vaccine.
