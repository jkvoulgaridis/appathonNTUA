      SPARTA force plate is used as rehabilitation tool in this study. The device is Force Plate
      coupled with SPARTA scan software that enables quick assessment of individual movement and
      balance within minutes. The magnitude as well as efficiency of force production is analyzed
      to determine an patient recovery graph.

      The investigator hope to learn co-relation between the rehab tool and clinical findings and
      analyse association if any. In this study, force plate is rehab tool, which will optimize
      care according to the patient's specific needs and provided insights to patients length of
      stay in the hospital. these data driven insights will be used to observe correlation between
      machine and clinic data
