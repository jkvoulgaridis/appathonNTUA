  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is most frequent after the fifth decade of life. Surgical risk is higher in
      aged population because of general health condition may affect the postoperative result. Aim
      of the study was to identify risk factors for post-operative mortality in octogenarian
      patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      236 patients (181: 80-85 years old and 55: &gt;85 years old) underwent surgery for gastric
      cancer at the Sant'Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital in Bologna between 2010 and 2015. The
      variables of the two groups of patients were compared.
