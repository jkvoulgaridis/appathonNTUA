  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic demyelinating
      polyneuropathy of autoimmune origin with a progressive or relapsing course.

      Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and electrophysiological findings in accordance
      with the EFNS/PNS consensus guidelines. IVIg is the first line treatment witch has been shown
      to be effective in several placebo-controlled trials.

      Once IVIg therapy produces a response and is well tolerated, some patients are able to
      continue their treatment in the home setting. The HOME LINK system offers an integrated,
      global solution based on telemonitoring technology providing continuous, remote monitoring of
      Privigen® infusions administered at home.

    <measure>Evaluate HOME LINK telemonitoring system for patients receiving home-based IVIg therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The conventional method of home monitoring requires using a visiting nurse. HOME LINK is a telemonitoring system that is an alternative to this conventional method offering remote at-home monitoring. HOME LINK monitors the patient's health parameters from home. In this way it enables an adjustment of the infusion conditions or intervention of a qualified healthcare professional in the event of an incident. Home Link will be evaluated for failure rate of connection to the telemonitoring platform, failure rate of transmission of self-measurements to the telemonitoring platform, failure rate of transmission of documents relating to home-based treatment, and failure rate of contacting one of the healthcare professionals involved in patient care during the at-home infusions.</description>
