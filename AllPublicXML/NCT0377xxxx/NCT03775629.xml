    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, multiple-dose, parallel study to compare PK and to evaluate
      Drug-Drug Interaction of CG100650 in healthy volunteers.

      Total of 39 health volunteers will be randomized to receive either of Group A, B or C for 14
      days (13 subjects each).

      [Group A] 13 subjects will receive Tramadol HCl 300mg(150mg tablet *2) once/day (Administrate
      from D10 to 14) + 2 mg Polmacoxib capsule once/day for 14 days(2 mg Polmacoxib capsule from
      Day 3 ~ 14. But, 6 mg on DAY 1, 8 mg on Day 2) [Group B] Polmacoxib capsule once/day for 14
      days (2 mg Polmacoxib capsule from Day 3 ~ 14. But, 6 mg on DAY 1, 8 mg on Day 2) [Group C]
      Tramadol HCl 300mg(150mg tablet *2) once /day for 5 days (Administrate from Day 1 to 5)

      * [Treatment]

        -  Group A: Tramadol hydrochloride (HCl) 300mg and polmacoxib 2mg combination regimen

        -  Group B: Polmacoxib 2mg capsule

        -  Group C: Tramadol hydrochloride (HCl) 300mg

      Pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated as primary endpoint by changes from baseline;
      Polmacoxib AUCmax, Cmax in either of whole blood and serum, tramadol HCl AUCmax, Cmax in
      serum. t1/2,SS, CL/F in whole blood will be evaluated as secondary endpoint.

      Safety evaluation will be carried out by conducting vital sign, laboratory test, ECG, and
      collecting AE, CM by different Group. Prevalence (%), average (SD) will be addressed using
      descriptive statistics.
