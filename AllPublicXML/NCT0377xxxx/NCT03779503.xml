      This study is a 55 subjects, randomised, double-masked, crossover, bilateral dispensing
      study, controlled by cross-comparison. Fifty-five subjects will wear each lens brand for
      approximately one week in random order. Lenses will be worn on a daily wear, daily disposable
      basis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. They are between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive).

          2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing to sign a Statement
             of Informed Consent.

          3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          4. They are an existing silicone hydrogel reusable spherical contact lens wearer in both
             eyes.

          5. They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -0.25D and -6.00D (inclusive)
             based on ocular refraction.

          6. They own a wearable pair of spectacles and wear them on the day of the initial visit.

          7. At dispensing, they can attain at least 0.20 logMAR distance high contrast visual
             acuity in each eye with the study lenses within the available power range.

          8. They are willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least five days per week and for
             at least eight hours per day).

          9. They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. They have an ocular disorder, which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          2. They have a systemic disorder, which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          3. They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment, or use any
             rewetting/lubricating drops whilst on this study.

          4. They are aphakic.

          5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          7. They are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          8. They have any ocular abnormality which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             normally contraindicate contact lens wear

          9. They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

         10. They have taken part in any contact lens or care system clinical research within two
             weeks prior to starting this study.
