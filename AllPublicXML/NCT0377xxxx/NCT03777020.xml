  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an invisible wound of war, affects approximately 20%1
      of the 18.5 million U.S. veterans and places them at higher risk for impaired biopsychosocial
      functioning. PTSD symptom severity (PTSDSS) is significantly correlated with stress and
      psychosocial consequences of inability to regulate emotions, control impulsive behaviors, and
      function within family and society. Alarming veteran PTSD rates and its insidious effects
      demand empirically validated treatment programs. More than a million veterans receive new
      diagnoses of each year. VA PTSD therapy programs reach only 1% of veterans. Nearly 35% of
      veterans do not respond to widely used psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatments. Training
      a service dog (SD) is a novel rehabilitative animal-assisted intervention that shows promise
      in other populations. This project evaluates the efficacy of a service dog training program
      (SDTP) as an alternative and adjunctive treatment and rehabilitative option for veterans with
      PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with PTSD attend 8 weekly sessions of either training a service dog or learning
      about how to train a dog at the Warrior Canine Connection facility in Boyds MD. They complete
      questionnaires prior to the start of the program and at the midpoint (after 4 sessions) and
      end of the program (after 8 sessions). Participants also wear a monitor to record heart rate
      variability during the 1st, 4th, and 8th sessions and provide saliva samples at these same
      times.

    <description>Veterans randomized to the SDTP will be paired with an experienced Warrior Canine Connection (WCC) Mission Based Trauma Recovery (MBTR)-Trainer (MBRT-T) and a service dog (SD). One hour training modules will be scheduled once a week for 8 weeks. Participants will come to WCC for all the weekly training modules. Participants will be paired with the same SD for the duration of the SDTP unless an unforeseen circumstance arises and the SD needs to be removed from the SDTP. The MBTR-T will deliver the prescribed SDTP modules created by WCC. Each session will be fully supervised by a WCC MBTR-T to address any concerns or safety issues that may arise.</description>

    <description>Veterans randomized to Dog Training Education will participate in one hour online SD training modules (https://e-trainingfordogs.com) scheduled once a week for 8 weeks. The online training modules are delivered by experienced SD trainers and will employ parallel content to the WCC SDTP. Participants will come to the WCC site for all the weekly online training modules. Members of the WLCI group will have education about dog training, but NO interaction with a SD. The online training modules for the DTE group are intended to keep the veterans who are not immediately assigned to the SDTP engaged in the study. They will participate in the SDTP after conclusion of participation in the 8 week study.</description>
