    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b open-label dose escalation trial of Ad/MG1-MAGEA3 and Pembrolizumab in
      patients with Metastatic Melanoma or Cutaneous Squamous Cell Skin Cancer that has failed
      prior standard of care treatments. Upon determination of a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or
      Maximum Feasible Dose (MFD) the study will be expanded into up to 24 additional Metastatic
      Melanoma patients.

      This is a Phase 1b open-label dose escalation trial of Ad/MG1-MAGEA3 and Pembrolizumab in
      patients with Metastatic Melanoma or Cutaneous Squamous Cell Skin Cancer that has failed
      prior standard of care treatments. This study will consist of two arms where the dose will be
      increased independently until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / maximum feasible dose (MFD)
      is reached.

      Arm 1 - Low-dose cyclophosphamide, followed by an Ad-MAGEA3 intramuscular (IM) prime,
      followed by intravenous (IV) administration of MG1-MAGEA3 and IV pembrolizumab.

      Arm 2 - Ad-MAGEA3 IM injection as a prime, followed by IV administration of MG1-MAGEA3,
      followed by intratumoral (IT) injection of MG1-MAGEA3 into tumors and IV pembrolizumab.

      In the Phase 1b Expansion for each arm, additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD/MDF
      as determined in Phase 1 in order to more thoroughly explore immune response,
      pharmacokinetics/dynamics, and safety for Malignant Melanoma patients who have failed
      standard therapies.
