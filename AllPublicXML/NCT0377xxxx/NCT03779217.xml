      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurs less frequently in women than in juvenile men.Frequently
      the estrogen deficiency associated with the menopausal state affects cardiovascular outcomes.
      In fact, in the post-menopausal state, even younger women may experience an increase in the
      rate of ischemic heart disease (IHD). On the other hand, CVD may also occur in premenopausal
      young women, due to not well known and/or not clearly investigated mechanisms. In addition,
      pre-menopausal women with IHD show atypical symptoms and more frequently myocardial
      infarction vs. angina pectoris. In detail, in these patients IHD is frequently due to
      mono-vessel coronary heart disease, and to the presence of cardiovascular risk factors such
      as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes. So, it is clear that all these
      pro-atherogenic risk factors which lead to IHD in women, are significantly lower in the
      pre-menopausal vs. post-menopausal patients. However, the causes leading to IHD and acute
      coronary events in pre-menopausal women remain poorly understood and poorly investigated, and
      these factors might be different from the traditional coronary risk factors evident in the
      general population. In this context, recently some authors have shown that subcutaneous
      abdominal fat affects cardiovascular performance at 1 year of follow-up in patients with
      normoglycemia vs. pre-diabetic. Therefore, here authors can hypothesize that in a population
      of female subjects, the fat tissue present in the mammary gland and the different degrees of
      mammary adipocyte infiltration can somehow invalidate the number of cardiovascular events in
      women of childbearing age. In detail, the different distribution of adipose tissue in the
      mammary gland can influence the density of the breast, as studied by mammographic
      examination, which is used to divide breast density into 4 different categories:

        -  Category A: the breast is represented by 80% of adipose tissue and less than 20% by
           fibro-glandular tissue.

        -  Category B: the breast is represented by adipose tissue in the range of 50-75% and for
           the rest by fibro-glandular tissue.

        -  Category C: the breast is represented by fatty tissuein the range 25-50% and the rest is
           from fibro-glandular tissue

        -  Category D: the breast is represented by almost entirely fibro-glandular tissue.

      Therefore, in the present study authors correlated the 4 different breast categories with CVD
      and 10-year follow-up IHD in women of child-bearing age. In fact, according to authors'
      opinion, a breast with higher fat density (category A) might influence the number of adverse
      cardiovascular events at 10-year follow-up in asymptomatic women. Thus, pre-menopausal women
      with breast tissue in category A as compared to women with prevalence of fibro-glandular
      tissue may have a higher frequency of adverse cardiac ischemic events at 10 years of
      follow-up.

        The study population will include asymptomatic women without neoplastic breast disease and
        other neoplastic diseases. These patients at enrollment did not have previous history of
        cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events. At enrollment all women did not have a
        diagnosis of menopausal status.
