  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with an
      increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in non-critically ill patient populations, but it
      is still unknown if this association exists in critically ill patients. The objective of this
      study is to compare AKI and efficacy of vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or
      beta-lactams.

      The combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with an
      increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in non-critically ill patient populations, but
      limited data regarding this association exists in critically ill patients. The objective of
      this study is to compare AKI and efficacy of vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or
      beta-lactams.

      This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Patients from the retrospective cohort
      will be divided into 2 groups based on the combination regimen received . Patients who meet
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in our registry. As a non-intervention
      study, these information as below will be collected: basic demographics, diagnosis,
      concomitant nephrotoxic and other antibiotic medications, serum creatine levels, vancomycin
      concentrations, and indication for antibiotics.
