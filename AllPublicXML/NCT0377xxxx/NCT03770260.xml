      This IB trial studies side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when given together with
      ixazomib in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come or does not respond to
      treatment. Pevonedistat and ixazomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MLN4924
      (pevonedistat) in combination with MLN9708 (ixazomib citrate [ixazomib]) in relapsed and/or
      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients after more than one previous line of treatment.
      (Dose-escalation phase) II. Describe the safety profile and tolerability of the combination
      of MLN9708 (ixazomib) and MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in the proteasome inhibitor (PI)-sensitive
      and PI-refractory populations. (Dose-expansion phase) III. Determine the anti-tumor activity
      and overall response rates (ORR) in patients with RRMM with the use of MLN9708 (ixazomib) and
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination. (Dose-expansion phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Attain pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with
      MLN9708 (ixazomib) for the purpose of understanding concentration-effect relationships of
      both agents. (Dose-escalation phase) II. Define the changes in correlative pharmacodynamics
      measures, namely regulated in development and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response 1
      (REDD1) and neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8).
      (Dose-escalation phase) III. Assess bone marrow-based measures of neddylation.
      (Dose-expansion phase)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate and predict disease response using the following tests: NEDD8: evaluated on
      blood and bone marrow samples; REDD1: evaluated on blood and bone marrow samples; and NAD(P)H
      dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1) and cystine/glutamate transporter (SLC7A11) (nuclear factor
      [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2 [NRF2] target genes): evaluated on whole blood as markers of
      MLN4924 (pevonedistat) activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pevonedistat.

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, and 15, and
      pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 2-3
      months for up to 2 years.

A two-sided 95% exact binominal confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated for each category. The myeloma response rate (responses &gt;= PR) will also be tabulated by dose cohort and overall.

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected PK data by dose and time as appropriate. Pevonedistat concentrations in these samples will be quantitatively measured using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry [LC/MS/MS]) method in place at Covance under contract with Takeda. For pevonedistat, the individual PK parameters from a single dose will be estimated for maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (t1/2), apparent CL/F, and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) using non-compartmental or compartmental PK methods with the software WinNonlin. Advanced population PK methods may be employed to assess the link between drug exposure and biological effects and efficacy.</description>

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected pharmacodynamic data by dose and time as appropriate. Changes in pharmacodynamic markers will be tabulated and descriptive statistics (e.g., geometric means and CV) calculated for each dose level. Exploratory correlative studies with pharmacodynamic (biological endpoints, toxicity, and efficacy) will be analyzed using Pearson or Spearman's correlation coefficient and tested with Wald's test.

    <measure>Biomarker analysis of NQO1 and SLC7A11</measure>

    <description>Descriptive statistics will first be used to summarize their gene expression in whole blood by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Biomarker data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate. Depending on whether data is normally distributed, Person or Spearman's correlation coefficient will be used to measure the correlations of NQO1 and SLC7A11 with the dosage of pevonedistat, and then tested with Wald's test. General Linear Model (GLM) will be used to compare each of the biomarkers (NQO1 and SLC7A11) between different dose levels of pevonedistat with and without adjusting for other factors. Logistics regression model will be further employed to test the adjusted effect of each biomarkers (NQO1 and SLC7A11) on the response rate after adjusting for dosage of pevonedistat as well as other factors.</description>

             start of this trial and throughout the duration of this trial

          -  Patients with known central nervous system involvement should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop

             there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat), breastfeeding should be
