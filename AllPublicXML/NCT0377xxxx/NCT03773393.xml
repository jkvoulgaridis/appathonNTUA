  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to determine whether it is safe and practical to
      give CK0801 (a Cord blood-derived T-regulatory cell product) to patients with bone marrow
      failure syndrome. Researchers want to determine the highest possible dose that is safe to be
      given. Researchers also want to learn if CK0801 may improve the symptoms of bone marrow
      failure syndrome.

      Patients enrolled in this study will all have been diagnosed with treatment refractory bone
      marrow failure syndrome (which includes aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or
      myelofibrosis). Participants eligible to participate in this study are unable or unwilling to
      be treated with standard therapy or have failed standard therapy.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine dose-limiting toxicity of CK0801 as defined as any of the events each start at
      the time of CK00801 infusion

        1. Severe (grade 3 or 4) infusion toxicity within 24 hours (NCI-CTCAE V4.0)

        2. Regimen related death within 30 days

        3. Severe (grade 3 or 4) Cytokine Release Syndrome within 30 days

      Secondary Objective:

        1. Preliminary assessment of disease-specific response

        2. Duration of disease-specific response

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of bone marrow failure syndrome
             including: aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myelofibrosis.

          2. HLA matched (≥ 3/6) cord blood unit available for CK0801 generation.

          3. Subjects age ≥ 18 years.

          4. Bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN and SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2 x ULN (unless Gilbert's syndrome is
             documented).

          5. Calculated creatinine clearance of &gt; 50mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

          6. Zubrod performance status ≤ 2.

          7. Female subjects of child bearing potential (FPCP) must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test. NOTE: FPCP is defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized.
             FPCP must agree to use maximally effective birth control or to abstain from
             heterosexual activity throughout the study. Effective contraceptive methods include
             intra-uterine device, oral and/or injectable hormonal; contraception, or 2 adequate
             barrier methods (e.g., cervical cap with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide).

          8. Subject has agreed to abide by all protocol required procedures including
             study-related assessments, visits and long term follow up.

          9. Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has received an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to CK0801 infusion.

          2. Subject has received radiation or chemotherapy within 21 days prior to CK0801
             infusion.

          3. Subject has received prior cord blood-derived T-regulatory therapy.

          4. HIV seropositivity.

          5. Subject has uncontrolled infection, not responding to appropriate antimicrobial agents
             after seven days of therapy. The Protocol PI is the final arbiter of eligibility.

          6. Subjects with uncontrolled inter-current illness that in the opinion of the
             investigator would place the patient at greater risk of severe toxicity and/or impair
             the activity of CK0801

          7. Subjects is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          8. Bone marrow failure caused by stem cell transplantation.

          9. Subjects who are unable to provide consent or who, in the opinion of the Investigator
             will be unlikely to fully comply with protocol requirements.
