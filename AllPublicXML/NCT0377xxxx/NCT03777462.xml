      This study is to investigate whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus SBRT results in better
      outcomes compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone and also compare the efficacy of
      gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT and S-1 plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial that investigate whether neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy plus SBRT results in better outcomes compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      alone and also compare the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT and S-1 plus
      nab-paclitaxel with SBRT. It is known that neoadjuvant therapy is vital for improved
      survival, which has been confirmed in previous studies that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or
      without radiotherapy provides superior overall compared with upfront surgery. However,
      question of whether the addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve
      prognosis compared with chemotherapy alone is a challenging matter. Also, no studies have
      evaluated the efficacy of S-1 as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for BRPC albeit similar
      prognosis has been found between S-1 and gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer. In this
      trial, patients with biopsy and radiographically confirmed BRPC will be randomly allocated
      into three groups: neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus
      nab-paclitaxel with SBRT and neoadjuvant S-1 plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT. Surgical
      resection will be performed 3 weeks after SBRT. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The
      secondary outcomes are progression free survival, pathological complete response rate, R0
      resection rate and incidence of adverse effects. If results show the survival benefits of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus SBRT and similar outcomes between S-1 and gemcitabine, it may
      provide evidence of clinical practice of this modality for BRPC.

    <description>Neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is used in this group. Intravenous administration of gemcitabine (1000mg/m2) and nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) are initiated on day 1, 8 and 15 during each 4-week cycle, which will repeat for 3 cycles. And surgical resection is performed after completion of the whole chemotherapy.</description>

After completion of the whole chemotherapy, patients will first receive PET-CT to exclude distant metastases and then undergo SBRT. The prescribed dose is 7.5-8Gy/f for 5 fractions. Dose constraints of normal tissues are referred to the American Association of Physicists in Medicine guidelines in TG-101. And surgical resection is performed 3 weeks after SBRT.</description>

Intravenous administration of nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) is initiated on day 1, 8 and 15 during each 4-week cycle, which will repeat for 3 cycles. And S-1 is orally administrated at a dose of 80 mg/m2 for 18 days followed by a 10-day rest during each 4-week cycle, which aslo continues for 3 cycles. After completion of the whole chemotherapy, patients will first receive PET-CT to exclude distant metastases and then undergo SBRT. The prescribed dose is 7.5-8Gy/f for 5 fractions.
