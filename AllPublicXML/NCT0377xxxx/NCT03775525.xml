  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of a novel
      anti-cancer drug, GZ17-6.02 administered to patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma,
      which have progressed after receiving standard/approved therapy or where there is no approved
      therapy.

      This Phase I study is an open-label, dose-escalation trial designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of the novel
      anti-cancer compound, GZ17-6.02. GZ17-6.02 is administered orally to patients with advanced
      solid tumors or lymphoma.
