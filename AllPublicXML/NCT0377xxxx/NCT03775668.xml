  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose, pharmacokinetic (PK) study conducted at 1 study center in
      the United States (USA). This study will evaluate the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
      and elimination (ADME), mass balance, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of
      intravenously administered 14C-AAI101.

          4. Judged to be in good health in the opinion of the Investigator on the basis of a

          5. Content of 14C in one or both (at Investigator's discretion) of urine and blood (or
             plasma) samples obtained at Screening does not significantly exceed the general
             environmental background 14C level.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant abnormal medical history, abnormal findings on physical
             examination, vital signs, ECG, or laboratory tests at Screening, Day -1 or pre-dose on
             Day 1 that the Investigator judges may put at risk achieving the objectives of the
             trial or protecting the safety of the volunteer.

          2. Documented congenital or acquired long QT syndrome.

          3. Corrected QT interval (QTc) using Fridericia correction (QTcF) at Screening or pre
             dose (Day 1) &gt;450 ms.

          4. Family history of long QT syndrome or of unexplained sudden death in a first-degree
             relative under age 50.

          5. History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of
             anaphylactic reaction.

             and no recurrence for at least 1 year), as judged by the Investigator.

             administration. Acceptable use history is typical consumption of up to 14 units per
             week (1 unit equals 250 mL beer, 75 mL wine, 25 mL spirits per week), or per judgment
             of the Investigator.
