  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to apply a community-based participatory research (CBPR)
      approach to rigorously refine and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an
      existing cardiovascular (CV) health and wellness digital application (app) prototype to
      improve CV health according to the American Heart Association Life's Simple 7 (LS7) framework
      among African-American (AA) adults within faith communities. The investigators hypothesize
      that the app-based intervention will be feasible and improve LS7 among AAs from baseline to
      6-months post-intervention.

    <measure>Life's Simple 7 Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline Life's Simple 7 Composite Score. The Life's Simple 7 Composite Score is adapted from the American Heart Association standards based on health assessment data and is a composite of each component (average BP from 3 readings, fasting lipid panel and glucose, height, weight, self-reported cigarette smoking status, dietary quality, and physical activity patterns). Point values are assigned to each component: 2 points for ideal, 1 point for intermediate, 0 points for poor. The total sum allows for a continuous measure of cardiovascular health ranging from poor to ideal (0-14 points). The final score will be categorized as 0-6 (poor), 7-8 (intermediate), 9-14 (ideal).</description>

    <measure>Dietary Quality (according to American Heart Association guidelines by the validated, culturally appropriate, Delta Nutrition Intervention Food Frequency Questionnaire-FFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in self reported dietary quality from baseline measured via a culturally relevant checklist of foods and beverages with a frequency response section for subjects to report how often each item was consumed. Responses range from never to 2 or more times per day (responses: never, less than 1 time per month, 1 time per month, 2-3 times per month, 1 time per week, 2 times per week, 3-4 times per week, 5-6 times per week, 1 time per day, 2 or more times per day). Calculations for nutrient intake can be estimated via computerized software programs that multiply the reported frequency of each food by the amount of nutrient in a serving of that food and then can be compared to the American Heart Association nutrient guidelines. Better adherence of the participant's diet to the guidelines indicates better dietary quality.</description>

    <description>The FAITH! App intervention includes a 10-week core series of multimedia education modules with a LS7 focus and other features including interactive self-quizzes, self-monitoring (diet/physical activity), and social networking. Participants will follow a weekly schedule of each module concentrating on each LS7 component. Personalized messages will be delivered to each participant 3-4 times weekly over the intervention phase through the app dashboard, text message, or email. The sharing board will be moderated weekly to foster discussion on behavior change influences and participant successes/challenges to healthy lifestyle. Participants will maintain app access for the duration of the study.</description>
