  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burst suppression (BS) is a not physiological pattern in the electroencephalogram (EEG). BS
      during general anesthesia is mainly seen as a sign for too deep hypnosis and may increase the
      risk of postoperative delirium (POD), a disturbance of consciousness arising within 24 hours
      after surgery. This monocentric, simple masked randomized study aims primarily to
      investigate, whether particular anesthesiological interventions reduce the occurrence of
      intraoperative burst suppression. The investigator initiated trial includes 66 patients (male
      and female) aged ≥ 60 years in two groups (intervention and control group). Secondary aims
      will be the correlation of burst suppression and mean arterial pressure, concentration of
      anesthetics and postoperative delirium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative burst suppression represents a non physiological EEG pattern. According to the
      literature and scientific knowledge, intraoperative burst suppression patterns might be
      caused either by hypotension resulting in a reduced cerebral circulation or by an
      oversedation of anesthetics correlating with a very deep level of hypnosis.

      Some publications exist that discuss the occurrence of intraoperative burst suppression
      especially in elderly people (aged ≥ 60 years) as a predictor of postoperative delirium and
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

      None of the studies however was able to prove a causal relationship between burst suppression
      and postoperative delirium. Contrary it might simply be an epiphenomenon.

      Conducting this interventional trail primarily aims to prove whether specific
      anesthesiological interventions, such as the treatment of intraoperative hypotension in first
      line and/or the reduction of the concentration of anesthetics in second line, reduce
      intraoperative burst suppression. Hence it might be possible to investigate a possible
      casualty between burst suppression and postoperative delirium in a second trial.

    <description>EEG and Entropy will be unblinded. The intervention starts with the start of a positive burst suppression rate. In the case of a concurrent hypotension the anesthetist treats the hypotension according to clinical standard operations in the first step. Hypotension means blood pressure values blow the baseline value which is defined by the lowest, preoperatively measured value. If after this treatment and a reevaluation of the BSR, BSR remains positive, the anesthetist is going to reduce the concentration of anesthetics in a second step. In case of positive BSR and a blood pressure value ≥ the baseline value, the concentration of anesthetics will be reduced as a first measure. The aim is to figure out whether one or both of these interventions can reduce to total, cumulative BSR.</description>

    <description>The treatment of hypotension can be done by the responsible anesthetist according to the clinical standard operations including any accepted drug typically used in this hospital. The reduction of anesthetics can be done either by reducing the volatile end tidal anesthetics concentration (ETAC) or the infusion rate of propofol.</description>
