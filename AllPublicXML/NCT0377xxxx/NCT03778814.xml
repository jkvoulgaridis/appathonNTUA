  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor organoids and TILs (and/or peripheral T cells) cultures will be established from fresh
      tissure of lung cancer and other solid tumors. Coculture will be utilized to screen
      tumor-responsive T cells which are further selected for monoclonal expansion and TCR cloning
      for engineered reconstitution of TCR-T cells. After verification by multiple in vitro and in
      vivo studies, a large number of TCR-T cells will be introduced back into the patients via
      vein, artery or tumor puncture, or combinations. In this phase I study, the safety, tolerance
      and preliminary efficacy of the TCR-T cell immunotherapy on human will firstly be assessed.

      1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced lung cancer or other solid tumors, with
           written consent for this study;

        2. Perform biopsy to obtain tissue for organoids and TILs, coculture to screening
           anti-tumor T cells, select monoclonal T cells;

        3. Clone TCR sequence; collect PBMCs from the blood of the patients, isolate and activate
           the T cells and produce TCR-T cells;

        4. Test the quality and killing activity of the TCR-T cells and then transplant back the
           patients via systemic (vein and/or artery) or local injections, and follow up closely to
           collect related clinical data as needed;

        5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.
