    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab and ibrutinib works in
      treating patients with central nervous system lymphoma that has come back or does not respond
      to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving nivolumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients
      with central nervous system lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate of nivolumab and ibrutinib in central nervous system
      (CNS) lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate of 4 weeks of ibrutinib single agent in CNS lymphoma.

      II. Determine the complete response rate of nivolumab and ibrutinib in CNS lymphoma.

      III. Determine the 1-year progression free and overall survival outcomes in CNS lymphoma.

      IV. Safety and toxicity of nivolumab and ibrutinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess activation of T cells in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. II. Assess the
      cytokine profile from microglial cells in cerebrospinal fluid. III. Correlate features of
      peripheral blood T cell activation with toxicities. IV. Correlate features of peripheral
      blood T cell activation with response and progression free survival (PFS).

      V. Correlate baseline tumor characteristics with response and PFS. VI. Evaluate the ability
      of minimal residual disease testing to monitor response and differentiate from pseudo
      progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Beginning course 1,
      patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B: Patients receive ibrutinib PO daily on days 1-28 and nivolumab IV over 1 hour on
      days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve at least a partial response after 6 courses may continue therapy for up
      to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 3-4 weeks and then every
      3 months for 2 years.

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the
             absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue
             risk
