    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomised, open label study of 3 clinically licensed treatments for ACS to
      assess the effects of these treatments on blood tests of endogenous fibrinolysis. 50 patients
      will be randomised to each of the 3 treatment arms in 1:1:1 ratio. Patients will receive the
      randomised treatment for 1 month after their index admission with ACS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks are caused by a blood clot occurring in a blood vessel (artery) which supplies
      blood to the heart. Such a clot can build up and block the blood flow, depriving part of the
      heart muscle of oxygen and blood, causing transient or permanent damage to the heart muscle.

      The standard treatment for a heart attack is two blood thinning medications combined, every
      day, to reduce the risk of further blood clots forming and to prevent another heart attack.
      The highest risk of another heart attack is in the next 30 days after the first heart attack.

      However, despite two blood thinners combined, some patients still go on to have another clot
      (heart attack or stroke or death) and this can be life threatening. Earlier research has
      shown that through a blood test, it is possible to identify patients who remain at increased
      risk of further clots and who may benefit from further blood thinners to reduce the risk of
      further heart attack, stroke and death in the next 30 days.

      The aim of this study is to test which of 3 blood thinning treatment options (all already in
      widespread clinical use) is best for patients to reduce further blood clots, in particular
      the addition of low dose rivaroxaban.
