  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative care of high risk patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has for long been
      considered to be the gold standard of care in terms of reducing perioperative mortality.New
      evidence from a 7-day cohort study involving 27 countries comes to question this practice.
      The primary objective of our study is to detect any benefit of postoperative ICU care after
      elective surgery in terms of patient's outcome, length of hospital stay, complications and
      cost.

      A prospective analysis of high perioperative risk patients that are about to be subjected
      into an elective operation will be included into the study. They will be allocated into two
      groups. Group ICU patients are those that are admitted into the ICU for postoperative care
      and those that are admitted into a standard ward consist Group Ward. Demographic data, the
      length of hospital stay, the outcome, the need of mechanical ventilation, the complications
      and the total cost will be recorded.
