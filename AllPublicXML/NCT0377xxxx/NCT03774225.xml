  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial was conducted in Sao Paulo,
      Brazil. Thrid eight People with Parkinson's Disease were recruited and randomly allocated in
      two groups: Experimental Group (EG), that performed the balance and gait training based on
      games from Microsoft Xbox Kinect System ® (MXKS) supported by manual and verbal guidance
      (MVG) provided by a PT and a control group (CG) that performed an identical training with no
      MVG during the training.

      It were recruited PPD in the &quot;Brazil Parkinson Association&quot; (BPA), a no-government
      association of PD care, where the assessments and intervention were performed from December
      2017 to June 2018. The PPD were recruited by randomization from the BPA list of active
      patients and waiting list for PT intervention.

      Outcome measures were obtained at up to three time points: before intervention, after 1 week
      and after 8 weeks of the end of intervention, the last time point was considered as a
      follow-up assessment. This study is in agreement with CONSORT guidelines for developing
      randomised trials . Primary measures was the functional balance evaluation by the Balance
      Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) and Rapid Turn Test (RT Test), and gait performance
      assessed in the six-minute walk test and Gait test in 30 seconds. As secondary measures were
      used: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale (UPDRS), 5-Step Standing Passing Test (ST-DP5),
      International Falls Efficiency Scale (FES-I), Brazilian Version of the Freezing Scale March
      (FOGQ), Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Geriatric Depression
      Scale (GDS-15).

      All patients performed 8 individual training sessions, under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist, twice a week for four weeks. Each session had 10 minutes of identical global
      exercises for both groups, consisting of stretching, muscle strengthening and axial mobility
      exercises, one serie per session. After these initial 10 minutes, both groups performed an
      additional 40 minutes of balance training using four XBOX games, four per session, under
      different conditions for MVG and NMVG.

      While the Control Group will be trained by conventional Physical Therapy exercises.
