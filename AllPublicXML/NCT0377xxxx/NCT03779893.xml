  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the performance; in terms of retention and caries
      inhibition; of the newly introduced bioactive resin based pits and fissure sealant versus
      conventional resin based pits and fissure sealant in caries susceptible fissures in posterior
      molars in patients at risk of caries. Evaluation will be done by visual tactile examination &amp;
      VistaCAM.

      In the investigator's study the comparator material will be BioCoat® by Premier® ; new
      bioactive resin pits and fissures sealant featuring SmartCap™ Technology. SmartCap™
      Technology utilizes patented semi-permeable resin microcapsules. In BioCoat, the rechargeable
      SmartCap microcapsules are filled with ionic solutions of fluoride, calcium and phosphate,
      which diffuse in and out of the sealant. Greater fluoride uptake in the presence of calcium
      and phosphate ions is assumed.

      With limited evidence based information in literature about using bioactive fissure sealants
      in susceptible fissures , it was found beneficial to evaluate the newly introduced material
      using a randomized controlled trial to test the null hypothesis that bioactive resin pits and
      fissure sealant will have the same clinical performance as conventional resin based pits and
      fissure sealant in susceptible fissures.
