  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pituitary tumours have an estimated prevalence of 20% in the general population and the
      number of clinically relevant pituitary adenomas is increasing with time. When symptomatic,
      the standard of care required for pituitary adenomas is resection through an endoscopic
      transsphenoidal approach. There is however significant olfactory dysfunction following
      endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery with approximately 23% of patients reporting
      some degree of worsening in their sense of smell in the postoperative period.

      Pedicled nasoseptal flaps are used to repair skull base defects following resection of skull
      base tumours. The superior incision is placed in close proximity to olfactory mucosa.
      Currently, these flaps are raised either with the use of electrocautery or scalpel. The use
      of electrocautery in surgery has provided surgeons with greater hemostasis when compared to a
      scalpel. This is of utmost importance in many regions of the head &amp; neck where highly
      vascularized tissue results in difficulties achieving adequate hemostasis and therefore
      limiting view of the surgical field. However, the use of electrocautery increases thermal
      damage to surrounding tissue and impairs wound healing when compared to a scalpel.

      Although the transmission of thermal energy via electrocautery to adjacent mucosa containing
      olfactory epithelium may theoretically contribute to olfactory disturbances, no prospective
      randomized controlled trials have yet examined the impact of these two different techniques
      on postoperative olfactory function. The purpose of this research study is to determine the
      effects, if any, of electrocautery versus scalpel on olfaction in raising the nasoseptal flap
      for repairing skull base defects following transphenoidal surgery.

    <textblock>
      Pedicled nasoseptal flaps are used to repair skull base defects following endoscopic
      transphenoidal surgery. The superior incision is placed in close proximity to olfactory
      mucosa. Currently, these flaps are raised either with the use of electrocautery or scalpel.
      While it is hypothesized that the olfactory mucosa is at greater risk of thermal injury with
      the use of electrocautery, no prospective multi-center studies have examined the impact of
      these two different techniques on postoperative olfactory function.

      Patients will be recruited through the Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery clinics. Based on
      previous studies in a North American population, a 10% change in UPSIT score was considered
      to be significant. With an alpha error set to 0.05, a beta of 0.8 and an effect size of 1
      standard deviation, a sample size of 20 was calculated.

      After obtaining consent for enrolment into the study, each patient will undergo either: (1)
      electrocautery or (2) scalpel in the elevation of nasoseptal flaps based on primary surgeon
      preference. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) will be used for
      baseline testing of olfactory function in all enrolled patients. Postoperatively, all
      enrolled patients will be seen in follow-up at 1, 3 and 6 months' time, at which point the
      UPSIT will be administered for testing of postoperative olfactory function.

      The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to determine differences between UPSIT scores pre-
      and postoperatively. Results of p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Linear
      regression will be used to examine relationships between UPSIT scores and other variables
      collected (e.g., demographic data, size/type of pituitary tumour, length of nasoseptal flap).

      Given that approximately 23% of all patients who undergo endoscopic transphenoidal surgery
      note some degree of worsening in their sense of smell following surgery, a prospective
      multi-center study comparing the two techniques would provide impetus to pursue one strategy
      over another in order to maintain an important sense, olfaction. Through optimizing
      preservation of olfactory mucosa during endoscopic skull base surgeries, patients' likelihood
      of not detecting environmental hazards (e.g., smoke, gas, other poisonous materials) will be
      reduced and, equally as important, their quality of life would be improved.

    <description>Multidimensional, disease-specific instrument designed to measure quality of life of patients who undergo surgical treatment for anterior or central skull base pathologies. It covers several disease‐specific domains including cognitive, endocrine, nasal, neurologic, visual, and other general areas.Each item is weighted equally in each domain score. Each domain is weighted equally in the overall score. Domain scores are calculated by taking the total score (sum of all items) in that domain divided by the maximum possible score for that domain multiplied by 100. The minimum score for each domain is 0 and the maximum is 100. The minimum score for the questionnaire is 0 and the maximum is 100. Higher score indicates better outcomes.</description>
