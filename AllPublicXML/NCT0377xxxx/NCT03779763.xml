    <textblock>
      Since the 1999 workshop, substantial new information has emergedfrom population studies,
      basic science investigations, and evidencefrom prospective studies evaluating environmental
      and systemic riskfactors. The analysis of this evidence has prompted the 2017 workshopto
      develop a new classification framework for periodontitis

      In the last 30 years, the classification of periodontitis has been repeatedly upgraded in an
      attempt to align it with emerging scientific evidence. The workshop agreed that, consistent
      with current knowledge on pathophysiology, three forms of periodontitis can be identified:
      necrotizing periodontitis, periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease and the forms
      of the disease previously known as &quot;chronic&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot;, now grouped under a single
      category, &quot;periodontitis&quot;.In revising the classification, the workshop agreed on a
      classification framework for periodontitis further characterized based on a multidimensional
      staging and grading system that could be adapted over time as new evidence emerges

      Staging is largely dependent upon the severity of disease at presentationas well as on the
      complexity of disease management.While,grading provides supplemental information about
      biological features of the disease, including a history based analysis of the rate of disease
      progression, assessment of the risk for further progression, anticipated poor outcomes of
      treatment, and assessment of the risk that the disease or its treatment may negatively affect
      the general health of the patient

      Staging involves four categories (stages 1 through 4) and is determined after considering
      several variables including clinical attachment loss, amount and percentage of bone loss,
      probing depth, presence and extent of angular bony defects, furcation involvement,tooth
      mobility and tooth loss due to periodontitis.

      Stage III &amp; IV are characterized by interdental clinical attatchment loss &gt; 5mm and
      radiographic bone loss extending to the middle or apical third of the root. In stage III,
      four teeth or less are lost while in stage IV, five teeth or more are lost due to
      periodontitis. In addition to stage II complexity, Stage III is characterized by probing
      depth greater than or equal 6 mm, vertical bone loss greater than or equal 3mm, furcation
      involvement class II or III and moderate ridge defect. In addition to stage III complexity,
      stage IV is characterized by severe ridge defect , bite collapse, drifting and flaring.

      The study aims at determining the prevalence of Periodontitis Stage III &amp; IV in adult
      Egyptian dental outpatients attending the diagnostic centre at faculty of Dentistry, Cairo
      University

        -  Dental patients will be recruited in a consecutive manner from the outpatient
             Diagnostic center, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.

          -  Medical history will be taken, thorough oral examination will be done, and a full
             questionnaire will be filled for each patient.

          -  Before filling the questionnaire, the aim of the study will be explained to the
             patient and the patient's acceptance to participate in the survey will be received.

          -  Non-respondent patients or patients refusing to participate will be reported with the
             cause of their refusal.

          -  The questionnaire will be filled through a face-to-face personal interview with the
             patient using simple, short, easily comprehended questions.

          -  The Questionnaire will include a section for demographic information of age, sex,
             social and educational levels of the patient. It will also include questions about
             medical condition, habits of trauma, smoking and its frequency.
