  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has decreased over the past 10 years.
      Nevertheless, the disease still kills one in three people. Hypertension is one of the leading
      causes of cardiovascular disease, with salt in the diet being a main contributor. Depending
      on an individual's DNA, participants may or may not be salt sensitive. Genotyping individuals
      for variants in a salt sensitivity gene (SLC4A5) may identify salt sensitive individuals
      which may benefit from a personalised dietary advice to reduce salt intake. Adherence to such
      advice can then be assessed which may aid in prevention of hypertension and CVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Salt sensitivity is a key risk factor for hypertension. However, population decrease in salt
      intake is less than optimal. Research suggests genetics-based personalised nutrition can
      positively impact health behaviours aiding in the prevention of chronic disease development.
      However, the effects of communicating such information are unclear. The aims of this study
      will be to analyse the impact of communicating genetic susceptibility to salt sensitivity on
      salt intake by assessing dietary salt intake before and after disclosure of genetic risk for
      hypertension according to the polymorphism in the SLC4A5. Participants will be normotensive,
      aged 18-35 years. All individuals will receive genetics-based personalised nutritional
      information. Participants displaying the risk genotype (AA + AC) will be advised to decrease
      salt intake to less than 4g/d and non-risk will be advised to adhere to government
      recommendations (6g/d). Dietary recall (24hrs) and 24-hour urine collection will be collected
      at baseline and four-weeks post-intervention to assess salt intake and excretion.
