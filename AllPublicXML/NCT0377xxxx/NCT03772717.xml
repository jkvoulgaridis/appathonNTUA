    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, in Atlanta, Georgia for a
      total duration of 24 months. The electrical neuromuscular stimulation device used in this
      study is the Vital EMS+, which has been used in multiple previous clinical studies for
      modulation of pain and has received FDA approval. A total of 10 study participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups in the study: 5 will receive the standard of care
      treatment plus electrical neuromuscular stimulation and 5 will receive standard of care and
      devices that do not deliver electrical stimulation (sham device). Participants will be
      requested to deliver nVNS two times per day, at least five days per week in their home, for
      two years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a chronic immune-mediated disease
      of the peripheral sensory motor nerves characterized by motor weakness, sensory loss, muscle
      wasting and loss of motor ability. Treatment of CIDP involves chronic use of steroids,
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rarely plasma exchange (PLEX). Outcome measures such as
      patient reported motor disability scores, electrophysiology parameters, functional motor
      strength testing are available to look for interval change. Despite above mentioned
      treatments, the majority of patients have tremendous disease burden. There is a need for
      alternative/adjunctive therapies that can decrease chronic inflammation effectively and
      safely in pediatric CIDP patients.

      Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has received significant scientific and clinical attention and
      has been shown to effectively reduce systemic inflammation. Results from early clinical
      trials for treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis have demonstrated significant lifestyle benefits
      and reduced symptoms in these patients. Similar benefits of VNS have been observed in Crohn's
      patients. In these studies, patients are surgically implanted with a stimulator with
      electrodes directly on the nerve. Preliminary results have demonstrated safety and efficacy
      in patients that previously were unresponsive to traditional pharmacological therapies.
      Unfortunately, surgical implantation of a device is difficult and costly.

      Recent investigations have significantly increased our understanding of non-invasive vagus
      nerve stimulation (nVNS). Compared to traditional implanted vagus nerve stimulation devices,
      nVNS uses electrodes placed on the skin surface to stimulate the vagus nerve and has shown
      promise in animal and human models to reduce chronic inflammation in multiple disease states.
      By delivering electrical pulses at the skin surface above the vagus nerve, neural pathways
      involved in regulating systemic inflammation are activated. Using a handheld device, patients
      apply a brief duration of stimulation multiple times per day to achieve therapeutic benefit.
      nVNS is currently FDA approved for clinical use in the treatment of migraines and cluster
      headaches, with on-going clinical studies on epilepsy and systemic inflammation. Preliminary
      published results have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefit to the patients with
      minimal side-effects.

      Ten study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups in the study: those
      receiving the standard of care treatment plus electrical neuromuscular stimulation and those
      receiving the standard of care treatment and devices that do not deliver electrical
      stimulation (sham device). Participants will be requested to deliver nVNS two times per day,
      at least five days per week in their home, for two years.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Motor nerve conduction studies are used to examine conduction of electrical impulses along nerves. Electrodes are placed on the skin in specific areas to evaluate peripheral nerves. An electrode will stimulate a nerve while the receiving site records how well electrical impulses are being conducted along the nerve. Latency is the time it takes in milliseconds (ms) for the electrical impulse to travel to the site receiving the stimulation.</description>

    <description>Motor nerve conduction studies are used to examine conduction of electrical impulses along nerves. Electrodes are placed on the skin in specific areas to evaluate peripheral nerves. An electrode will stimulate a nerve while the receiving site records how well electrical impulses are being conducted along the nerve. F wave latency is the time it takes in milliseconds (ms) for an electrical signal to travel from the stimulating electrode to the distal muscle and back to the stimulating site. F waves are used to assess polyneuropathy and F wave latency can be extended or even absent in persons with CIDP.</description>

    <description>Motor nerve conduction studies are used to examine conduction of electrical impulses along nerves. Electrodes are placed on the skin in specific areas to evaluate peripheral nerves. An electrode will stimulate a nerve while the receiving site records how well electrical impulses are being conducted along the nerve. Conduction velocity measures the rate of impulse conduction (distance/time) and is often decreased in patients with CIDP as myelination is affected.</description>

    <description>Motor nerve conduction studies are used to examine conduction of electrical impulses along nerves. Electrodes are placed on the skin in specific areas to evaluate peripheral nerves. An electrode will stimulate a nerve while the receiving site records how well electrical impulses are being conducted along the nerve. Conduction amplitude is the size of the response to electrical stimulation, measured in millivolts (mV). Reduced amplitude indicates axon loss.</description>

    <description>The Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) used for those with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and gammopathy-related polyneuropathy (MGUSP) is a 24-item scale asking respondents to rate how greatly polyneuropathy impacts activities. Responses are on a scale of 0 to 2 where 0 indicates it is not possible for the respondent to perform the task and 2 means that the task can be performed without difficulty. Total scores range from 0 to 48 and higher scores indicate greater ability to perform daily and social tasks.</description>

Participants will deliver nVNS twice per day for 60 minutes each time at least 5 days per week, for 2 years. The two electrodes for the device are placed on the left cervical (neck) region or on the left ear. Parents will be trained on where to place electrodes, how to ensure that the electrodes make a good contact with the skin, and how to set the stimulation parameters. The stimulation frequency (number of pulses) and amplitude (amount of current) will be set during the initial baseline session in the clinic at a level that prevents discomfort and does not impact cardiorespiratory parameters.</description>
