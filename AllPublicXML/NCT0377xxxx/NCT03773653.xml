  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This comparative efficacy study will be based on a 3-armed controlled trial: bilateral
      robotic priming combined with bilateral arm training (bilateral RT+BAT), bilateral robotic
      priming combined with mirror therapy (bilateral RT+MT), and the control intervention
      (bilateral RT+IOT). The goal of this 4-year project is to provide scientific evidence of the
      comparative efficacy research of hybrid interventions based on unilateral vs. bilateral
      approach to upper limb rehabilitation in subacute and chronic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed research fits in the NHRI research priority 4-1 by addressing innovative
      treatment strategies for stroke that is in desperate need of scientific scrutiny. Stroke is
      one of the major medical conditions that lead to long-term disability and causes heavy health
      care and financial burden. Advances in clinical and translational neurosciences have led to
      the new development of stroke rehabilitation. Current stroke rehabilitation programs such as
      robotic therapy, mirror therapy, and bilateral arm training are bilateral approaches to
      intensive practice based on the tenet of practice-dependent neuroplasticity. Bilateral
      robotic therapy can potentially be a movement-based priming technique to promote rebalancing
      of cortical excitability and create an enriched neuroplastic environment by priming the brain
      to facilitate motor and functional recovery. This proposed research project will: (1) examine
      the effects of bilateral robotic priming combined with bilateral arm training approach versus
      bilateral robotic priming combined with mirror therapy, relative to the control intervention
      approach (bilateral robotic priming combined with impairment-oriented training) on
      sensorimotor function, daily function, self-efficacy, quality of life, and motor control
      strategy in patients with stroke, (2) investigate the 3-month retention effects of robotic
      priming combined with contemporary rehabilitation approaches (i.e., bilateral arm training
      and mirror therapy) and the control intervention, and (3) identify the potential predictors
      of functionally relevant changes after therapy.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) at 3 weeks and 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS will be used for measurement the achievement of each participant's expectation in the course of intervention. The individual intervention goals related to daily activity will be negotiated by the therapists and participants. For the goals potentially achievable and not overly ambitious, each goal will be rated on a 5-point ordinal scale with the level of attainment captured. The importance and the difficulty for each goal will be scored also based on a 3-point ordinal scale (1 to 3). The overall GAS score will be calculated by a following formula and a GAS summed score larger than 50 refers to an above-expected performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM consists of 18 items (scale 18-126) grouped into 6 subscales measuring self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition ability. The higher summed score means the greater recovery of functional independence.</description>

    <description>The SIS 3.0 is a stroke-specific health-related quality of life instrument. It consists of 59 items assessing 8 domains (i.e., strength, hand function, activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion. memory and thinking and participation). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with lower scores indicating greater difficulty in task completion during the past week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Activity level as evaluated by actigraphy at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the ActiGraph GX3 accelerometers (ActiGraph, Shalimar, FL, USA) to quantitatively measure the amount of use outside the laboratory settings. The accelerometer will record the number of moves each minute, and the average counts of move per minute will be calculated as the primary outcome measure.</description>
