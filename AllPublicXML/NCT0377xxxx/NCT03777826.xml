  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder, where subjects are born with a
      genetic deficiency in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (PAH), which leaves them unable to
      convert Phenylalanine (Phe) into Tyrosine (Tyr). Patients with mild PKU or partly responsive
      to the drug synthetic tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (Kuvan®) can change to a more relaxed diet.
      However due to difficulty to adapt their diet, these patients are at risk of an imbalanced
      nutritional status and an insufficient intake of specific micronutrients, essential amino
      acids and DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid). The study product is designed to improve the
      nutritional status of the patients.

      The study investigates if the nutritional status is indeed improved following 24 week use of
      the study product, and also the study aims to evaluate product acceptability.
