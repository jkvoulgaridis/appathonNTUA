  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gender differences in the effect of meal schedule will be studied in a parallel design (10
      women and 10 men). In two separate days a probe meal (290 stewed beans, 35 g bread, 100 mL
      water; 549 Kcal) will be administered in the afternoon, i.e. conventional schedule, and in
      the morning, i.e. unconventional schedule. The effect of meal schedule will be measured as
      the differences between the responses on both study days. Participants will be instructed to
      eat standard dinner the day before and to consume standard breakfast at home the day of the
      afternoon test. Studies will be conducted in a quiet, isolated room with participants siting
      on a chair. Perception will be measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after
      ingestion and at 10 min intervals up to 60 min after the probe meal.
