        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has right and left IOH volume deficit with a rating of 2 or 3 (moderate or severe) on
             the MIHAS, as determined by the blinded evaluator. The treating investigator must
             agree that the subject meets this criterion of a 2 or 3 rating on the MIHAS.

          -  Has the same MIHAS score on both IOHs (i.e., IOHs are symmetrical).

          -  Is at least 22 years of age.

          -  Understands and accepts the obligation not to receive any other procedures (i.e.,
             dermal fillers, toxin treatments, facial ablative or fractional laser, microderm
             abrasion, chemical peels, non-invasive skin-tightening [e.g., Ultherapy, Thermage] and
             surgical procedures) in the face during participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior lower-eyelid surgery, including orbital or midface surgery, or has a permanent
             implant or graft in the midfacial region that could interfere with effectiveness
             assessments or plans to have it during the study.

          -  Has gained or lost ≥ 2 body mass index (BMI) units within the previous 90 days or has
             the intention to gain or lose a significant amount of weight during the first 90 days
             of the study.

          -  Ever been treated with fat injections or permanent and/or semi-permanent dermal
             fillers in the midfacial region or plans to receive such treatments during
             participation in the study.

          -  Received lower eyelid and/or malar region treatments with any absorbable or temporary
             fillers such as porcine-based collagen fillers, hyaluronic acid (HA) products,
             RADIESSE®, poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) or received mesotherapy treatment to the area
             within the past 24 months or plans to receive such treatments during participation in
             the study.

          -  Any current or history of uncontrolled retinal disease or detached retina or any other
             condition with the potential to cause a decline of visual acuity (e.g., uncontrolled
             diabetes).

          -  Received deep facial dermal therapies (i.e., facial ablative or fractional laser, deep
             chemical peels, non-invasive skin-tightening [e.g., Ultherapy, Thermage]) to the
             periorbital or malar region within the past 12 months or plans to receive such
             treatment during participation in the study.

          -  Received superficial facial dermal therapies (i.e., microderm abrasion, superficial
             chemical peels) to the periorbital or malar region within the past 6 months or plans
             to receive such treatment during participation in the study.

          -  Received toxin treatment to the periorbital region within the past 6 months or plans
             to receive such treatment during participation in the study.

          -  Received immunosuppressive medications or systemic steroids (except intranasal/inhaled
             steroids) in the past 2 months or plans to receive them during participation in the
             study.

          -  Tendency to accumulate fluid in the lower eyelids, has developed festoons, or has
             large and/or herniating infraorbital fat pads.

          -  Lower lid retraction, significant prominent eyes, or severe negative facial vector.

          -  Dark circles under the eyes due to pigmentation changes and not from infraorbital
             hollow shadowing.

          -  Ectropium, entropion, or trichiasis of the lower eyelid or eye diseases that lead to
             reddening and tendency of watering of the eye.

          -  Active or a history of recurrent or chronic infraorbital edema or rosacea or
             uncontrolled severe seasonal allergies.

          -  A history of allergic/anaphylactic reactions, including hypersensitivity to lidocaine
             or anesthetics of the amide type, hyaluronic acid preparations, gram positive
             bacterial proteins, or any of the device components.

          -  A known bleeding disorder or has received or is planning to receive anti-coagulation,
             anti-platelet, or thrombolytic medications (e.g., warfarin), anti-inflammatory drugs
             (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen), or other substances known to increase coagulation time
             (vitamins or herbal supplements, e.g., vitamin E, garlic, gingko), from 10 days before
             to 3 days after injection.

          -  Any other medical condition with the potential to interfere with the study outcome
             assessments or compromise subject safety (e.g., increase the risk of AEs).
