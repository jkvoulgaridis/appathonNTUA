  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) is a painful, debilitating complication of leprosy. Patients
      often require high doses of corticosteroids for prolonged periods. Thalidomide is expensive
      and not available in most countries. The use of corticosteroids for long periods is
      associated with adverse effects and mortality. It is a priority to identify alternative
      agents to treat ENL. Methotrexate (MTX) is a cheap, widely used medication which has been
      reported to be effective in ENL resistant to steroids and thalidomide.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of MTX for
      managing ENL. Patients diagnosed with moderate or severe ENL at ENLIST Group centres in
      Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Nepal will be randomly allocated to
      receive a 15 or 20 mg of oral MTX each week for 48 weeks and prednisolone 40 mg per day
      reducing to zero over 20 weeks. The control group will receive an identical prednisolone
      scheme. The participants will be stratified into two groups, those with acute ENL, those with
      chronic/recurrent ENL. The interventions for both populations are the same, although analysed
      separately. Adverse effects (AE) will be closely monitored clinically and using laboratory
      tests. Participants will receive folic acid, 5mg daily for 52 weeks except on the day of MTX
      to prevent AEs, and nausea will be managed with ondansetron.

    <description>Change in patient reported health-related quality of life at 24 and 48 weeks from baseline. This will be measured by 36- Item Short Form (SF-36) questionnaire developed by RAND, validated worldwide. The SF-36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability. If the score is 0 is equivalent to maximum disability. The 8 sections are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.</description>
