  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at how the study drug, tucatinib, affects the heart. Tucatinib is being
      studied as a possible treatment for breast cancer. This study will recruit healthy
      volunteers. There are 3 parts in the study. Each volunteer will be in all 3 parts. One part
      will be to take the study drug, the second part will be to take a placebo (pill with no
      medicine), and the third part will be to take moxifloxacin. The volunteers will only know
      what part of the study they are in when they take moxifloxacin. For the study drug and
      placebo parts, volunteers will take 2 pills by mouth for 5 days. For the moxifloxacin part,
      volunteers will take 1 pill by mouth for 1 day.

      This study will evaluate the effects of a steady state therapeutic dose of tucatinib on QTcF
      (QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's method) in healthy individuals. In
      this design, study treatment will be dosed in 3 sequential treatment periods:

      Treatment A: Oral doses of 300mg tucatinib for 5 days

      Treatment B: Oral doses of matching placebo for tucatinib for 5 days

      Treatment C: A single oral dose of 400 mg of moxifloxacin

      Patients will be randomized based on 2-Williams-square design to 1 of 6 treatment sequences
      to maintain the study blind for tucatinib and placebo.
