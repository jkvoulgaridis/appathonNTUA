    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Established and documented diagnosis of CHI based on standard of care

          -  Experiencing ≥3 events of hypoglycemia per week (PG &lt;70 mg/dL [&lt;3.9 mmol/L]) according
             to the investigator's evaluation

          -  Previously undergone near-total pancreatectomy or being treated with a non-surgical
             approach, having been evaluated as not eligible for pancreatic surgery

          -  If somatostatin analogues or sirolimus are used, the therapy should be well
             established as judged by the investigator, especially when considering their
             biological half-life

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous administration of dasiglucagon

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the trial drug or related products

          -  Previous participation (randomization) in this trial

          -  Circulatory instability requiring supportive medication

          -  Requires exogenous insulin

          -  Body weight of &lt;4 kg (8.8 lbs.)

          -  Documented HbA1c ≥7% subsequent to near-total pancreatectomy and within 6 months prior
             to screening

          -  Known or suspected presence of significant central nervous system disease/injury such
             that in the investigator's opinion will affect trial participation

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids, e.g., hydrocortisone &gt;20 mg/m2 body surface area or
             equivalent in the 5 days before screening

          -  Use of anti-inflammatory biological agents, or other immune modulating agents in the 3
             months prior to screening

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified on echocardiogram that in the
             opinion of the investigator would affect the patient's ability to participate in the
             trial

          -  Any recognized clotting or bleeding disorders

          -  Has participated in an interventional clinical trial (investigational or marketed
             product) within 3 months of screening or 5 half-lives of the drug under investigation
             (whichever comes first), or plans to participate in another clinical trial.
