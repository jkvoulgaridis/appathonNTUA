  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project collaborates with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC
      DOHMH) to develop and test a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention for
      HIV-exposed contacts notified by its Partner Services (i.e., HIV contact tracing) program.
      The goal of the study is to develop and test the impact of this new intervention on improving
      rates of HIV testing, linkage to HIV prevention/care, and PrEP uptake among highest risk
      contacts recently exposed to HIV. We will conduct a 6-month pilot project, followed by a
      cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which 12 clusters of NYC
      neighborhoods are exposed to the intervention sequentially, with three clusters moving from
      control to intervention every 6 months (n = 1150). Primary outcomes are HIV testing, timely
      PrEP/ARV uptake, and linkage to PrEP/HIV care. Secondary outcomes are STD testing and receipt
      of STD treatment (if indicated).

    <description>The Partner Services-Sexual Health Intervention enhances the current standard of care by introducing four service innovations to the DOHMH Partner Services program: (1) enhanced field-based combination HIV and STI testing; (2) immediate field-based ARV/PrEP start; (3) navigation to a sexual health clinic for test results and treatment; and (4) enhanced linkage support to facilitate ongoing PrEP or HIV care.</description>
