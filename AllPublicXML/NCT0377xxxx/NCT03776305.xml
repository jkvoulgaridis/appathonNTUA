  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become increasingly used for lifesaving
      respiratory and/or cardiac failure support in critically ill patients, including those with
      life-threatening severe infections. This cardiopulmonary bypass device has been shown to
      enhance the profound pathophysiological changes in this patient population, resulting in an
      alteration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antimicrobial agents. The aim of this study was to
      determine the effect of ECMO on the PK of imipenem in critically ill patients supported by
      this cardiopulmonary bypass device.

      Methods The study was conducted in critically ill patients with respiratory and/or cardiac
      failure and suspected severe nosocomial infections who were supported by ECMO. All patients
      received a 1-h infusion of 0.5 g of imipenem every 6 h and imipenem PK studies were carried
      out on the fourth dose of drug administration.

    <description>1-h infusion of 0.5 g of imipenem diluted in 100 mL of normal saline solution, delivered via infusion pump at a constant flow rate, every 6 h. The imipenem PK studies were carried out during administration of the fourth dose of each regimen (18-24 h after the start of the regimen). Blood samples were obtained by direct venipuncture at the following times: before (time zero) and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after the fourth dose of each regimen.</description>
