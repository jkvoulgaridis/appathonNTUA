  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is one of the treatments for Nasopharyngeal carcinoma . The most common
      side effects of post-radiation may be radiation-induced oral mucositis . When severe, oral
      mucositis increases the risk of infection and may affect clinical outcomes due to treatment
      interruption, dose reduction, and reduced treatment compliance. In China, a quadruple mixture
      of dexamethasone, gentamicin, vitamin B12, and lidocaine is commonly used in patients who
      begin to have radiation-induced oral mucositis . However, the incidence of radiation-induced
      oral mucositis remains high. Recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor is a
      multifunctional cell growth factor that stimulates the growth of cells derived from mesoderm
      and neuroectodermal cells and thus has a wide range of biological activities. The drug has
      different degrees of promotion on the three stages of the wound repair process, namely the
      local inflammatory reaction stage, cell proliferation and differentiation, granulation tissue
      formation stage and tissue reconstruction stage. The purpose of this randomized controlled
      trial was to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor as an
      intervention in radiation-induced oral mucositis for the treatment of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma , with a commonly used quadruple mixture (from dexamethasone, gentamicin , vitamin
      B12 and lidocaine composition) were compared.

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a Quality-of-Life Instrument proposed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), for use in International Clinical Trials in Oncology. The QLQ-C30 incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale.</description>

    <description>Recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor is prescribed at the beginning of radiotherapy for free. Patients are asked to start application of recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor at the onset of radiotherapy, four times a day (after meals and before bedtime), until completion of their radiotherapy. All patients will receive conventional health education and medical care for prevention and treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis. When grade ＞ 3 OM happened, other interventions, such as prophylactic or therapeutic antibacterial therapy, will be used, and radiotherapy should be interrupted.</description>
