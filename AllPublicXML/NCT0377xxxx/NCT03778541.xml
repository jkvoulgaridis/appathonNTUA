  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center randomized phase III trial was conducted to investigate the feasibility and
      safety of adding temozolomide to hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large brain
      metastases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previous single arm phase II trial and propensity- matched study of our institution have
      shown that HFSRT combined with concurrent TMZ was safe and efficient for patients with BMs of
      ≥ 6cc in volume. The 1-year local control, intracranial progression free survival,
      progression free survival and overall survival rates were better than HFSRT alone group.
      Thus, the investigator conducted this randomized phase III trial to broad the sample size and
      verify our previous results. To finish the study in time, the investigator designed a
      multi-center trial.
