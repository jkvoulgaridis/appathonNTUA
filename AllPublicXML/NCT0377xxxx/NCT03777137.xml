  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, single-blinded, long-term exploratory study using participant
      as his/her own control to evaluate and compare the potential analgesic effect on experimental
      heat pain of Transcutaneous Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS will be delivered by a
      commercially available device (Rapid2, Magstim Corp) at three different cortical target sites
      and one sham target site in healthy participants 18-88 years of age. The quantitative
      evaluation measure is the change in the painful heat threshold Quantitative Sensory Testing
      (QST) of thresholds for cutaneous heat stimuli before and after TMS.

      After subjects contact the office to express interest in being involved with this protocol,
      subjects will take the telephone screening questionnaire. Those who meet inclusion criteria
      with no exclusions will come for first visit. At this visit, subjects will discuss and sign
      the consent form, and have a one sequence MRI scan which is used to localize sites in the
      brain to be stimulated with TMS.

      The subjects will then have four visits at intervals of two weeks; each visit will have TMS
      intervention designated (SITE1), (SITE2), (SITE3), and (SITE4). TMS will be applied each of
      four sites (SITE1, SITE2, SITE3, and SITE4) which will be randomly assigned among stimulation
      sites Medial Frontal (MF), Dorsolateral Frontal (DL), Primary Motor Cortex (M1 and superior
      Interparietal sulcus (Sham) and counterbalanced across subjects (see Diagram below).

      During each of visits 2 to 5, the participant will undergo baseline Quantitative Sensory
      Testing (QST), followed by TMS stimulation and then by repeat QST. QST will consist of pain
      thresholds for cutaneous hot stimuli. Visits 2 through 5 will last for approximately 1 hour
      each and will occur at two-week intervals. The total study duration will be 50 days for each
      subject. Study enrollment will last for three years and total study duration will be four
      years.

    <description>Volunteers will take a telephone screening questionnaire and those meeting inclusion criteria will attend their first visit. Those signing the consent will have a T1 weighted MRI scan to localize sites in the brain to be stimulated with TMS. The subjects will then have four visits at intervals of two weeks; each visit will have a TMS intervention including SITE1, SITE2, SITE3, and SITE4. The sequence of the testing TMS four different visits (SITE1 to SITE4) will be randomly assigned among stimulation sites Medial Frontal (MF), Dorsal Lateral Frontal (DL), Primary motor cortex (M1) and Interparietal Sulcus (Sham) and counterbalanced across subjects (see Diagram below). During each of visits 2 to 5, each participant will undergo baseline Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), followed by a TMS intervention, and then by repeat QST. QST will consist of pain thresholds for contact heat.</description>
