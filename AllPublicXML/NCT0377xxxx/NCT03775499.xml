      This trial is a multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, 2 by 2 cross-over
      design (i.e. 2-sequences, 2-periods, 2-treatments) for each specific population (i.e.
      self-reported Non Coeliac Gluten Sensitivity and Coeliac Disease subjects).

      1 capsule of BL NCC 2705 or placebo will be given twice a day in the morning and in the
      evening with a meal over 2 periods of 4 days.

      On day four a single dose of gluten (3g) will be administered and duodenal fluid will be
      collected in the following hours through a naso-intestinal catheter. The viability of BL NCC
      2705, the production of serpin and its effects on gluten digestion and intestinal enzymatic
      activity will be determined.

      No chronic administration of gluten as a challenge is foreseen in the study.

      After a wash out period of minimum 2 weeks, period will be repeated.
