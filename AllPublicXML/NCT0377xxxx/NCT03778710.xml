      D2 gastrectomy is standard treatment of early gastric cancer in Japan but in other countries
      there is still some discord, especially in Europe and North America. Although the quantity of
      metastasis cancer in lymph node defines survival regardless of which country the patient is
      treated, the total number of lymph nodes harvested is an important factor to predict accurate
      staging and/or D2 gastrectomy. Both of the number total lymph nodes and the metastasis lymph
      node status in gastric cancer are important factors to decide each prognosis. This study
      evaluated the correlation between total lymph nodes retrieved and metastasis node by lymph
      node ratio (LNR) status to determine the recurrence rate after curative resection of gastric

      A retrospective chart review was made of all patients who presented with gastric cancer after
      curative surgery resection from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2016 in Ramathibodi
      Hospital.Data of metastasis node by lymph node ratio (LNR) were evaluated. The total of lymph
      node less than 15 and more than 15 were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier curve estimates
      recurrence survival (Log-rank test). The p-value &lt; 0.05 is statistically significant.

      OBJECTIVE :

      The outcome of this study was evaluated lymph node ratio (LNR) status that determined by the
      ratio of total lymph node metastasis and the total lymph node which retrieved after performed
      the curative surgery and lymphadenectomy of gastric cancer. The correlation of LNR and
      prognosis of recurrence and survival of gastric cancer patients were evaluated and reported
      in this study.
