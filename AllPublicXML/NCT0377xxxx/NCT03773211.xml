      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of Renaparin in adult patients receiving a
      deceased donor kidney treated ex-vivo with Renaparin prior to transplantation. Half the
      patient group will receive a kidney treated with Renaparin, while the other half of the
      patient group will receive a kidney treated with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the last resort for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A key problem
      after transplantation is Delayed Graft Function (DGF). Short term, DGF will result in
      patients being put on dialysis in the immediate time-period after transplantation. In the
      longer perspective DGF is associated with increased risk of graft failure, thus decreasing
      the efficacy of the kidney transplantation.

      Renaparin is a new product under development for the prevention of DGF in association with
      kidney transplantation. The product binds to the kidney vascular endothelium and its
      pharmacological effect is based on a local and effective presentation of heparin. Renaparin
      is administered ex vivo to the kidney by adding it to the preservation solution during
      Hypothermic Machine Perfusion (HMP) prior to transplantation.

          -  Patient has been listed for kidney transplantation from a deceased donor at the
             clinical sites included in this study.

          -  Negative crossmatch test prior to transplantation and no existence of donor-specific

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Organs:

          -  Organs from donors deceased due to cardiac death.

          -  Organs which have not been adequately perfused during HMP, as judged by the
             transplantation surgeon on call.

        Patients:

          -  Use of an investigational drug or other investigational treatment, that could
