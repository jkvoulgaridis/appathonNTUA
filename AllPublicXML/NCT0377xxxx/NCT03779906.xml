      This is a Phase IV prospective, multicenter, observational study to estimate the proportion
      of subjects 0 to 3 years of age who develop abnormal thyroid function after exposure to
      intravascular administration of ISOVUE for the required radiologic procedure as part of their
      standard of care.

             placement of a central line;

          -  Has any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly decrease
