  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-Acute Care(PAC) had been inaugurated in Taiwan for almost four years and current essays
      revealed positive effects upon general improvements in stroke patient after PAC training.
      During acute phase, a stroke patient would admit to internal medicine or surgical ward and
      transferred to rehabilitative ward for more intensive therapeutic programs, restoring muscle
      power and promoting activity of daily life(ADL) ability. Under relative stable condition, the
      patient would transfer to PAC institution or hospitals afterwards for continuing
      rehabilitative program if the patient is acknowledged to have rehabilitative potentials.
      However, there's still lacking of investigation upon whether the length of stay in PAC
      correlates to general improvements. Thus, stroke patients' functional ability, such as
      activities of daily living (ADL) function, swallowing ability and so on, as well as their
      corresponding scales were assessed on the first and last day during PAC hospitalization.
      Statistical analysis was conducted via SPSS ver21.0 to compare the relationship of
      improvements in functional ability and the length of stay in PAC. We're looking forward to
      the final results!

      Functional ability in stroke patients are evaluated by following measurements. Activity of
      daily life (ADL) function was estimated through modified Rankin scale(MRS) and Barthel
      index(BI), swallowing ability by functional oral intake scale, nutritional status via mini
      nutritional assessment, life quality through EuroQoL-5D, instrumental ADL function by
      Lawton-Brody IADL Scale(IADL), balance/coordination via Berg Balance Test, walking speed
      through Usual Gait Speed, cardiopulmonary capability by Six-Minute Walk Test, occupational
      mobility (amount use/quality) via Motor Activity Log, language through concise Chinese
      aphasia test, motor function of upper extremities by Fugl-Meyer Assessment and so on.

    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Activity of daily life function is evaluated by both Barthel index(Range: 0~100 score; higher score indicates better function) and Modified Rankin Scale(Grade 1~6; the lower grade indicates better function). Task-oriented activity of daily life is assessed by Industrial activity of daily life(Range: Male 0~5 score and female 0~8 score; Higher score indicates better function)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional status is evaluated by Mini nutritional assessment(Range: 0.0~30.0). Higher score indicates better function</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral intake function</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Oral intake is evaluated by Functional oral intake scale(Range: level 1~7). Higher level indicates better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiopulmonary capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiopulmonary capacity is evaluated by 6-minute walk test, which requires the patients to walk as much as they can within 6 minutes. Walking length is presented in meters. Longer distance and more meters indicate better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking speed</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed is evaluated by Usual Gait Speed, which require the patients to walk certain distance and record the time that needed to finish the whole course. Time is presented with seconds. The shorter time and lower seconds indicate better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper motor hand function</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Upper motor hand function is evaluated by Fugl-Meyer assessment(Range 0~44 scores) Higher scores indicate better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Life quality</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Life quality is evaluated by EuroQoL-5D(Range: 5~15 scores). Lower scores indicate better life quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance and coordination</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Balance and coordination is evaluated by Berg-Balance test(Range: 0~56). Higher scores indicate better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition is evaluated by Mini-Mental Sate Examination(Range: 0~30 score). Higher scores indicate better cognition.</description>

    <measure>Speech function</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Speech function is evaluated by Concise Chinese Aphasia Test(Range: 1~12 scores). Higher scores indicate better speech function</description>
