      This phase 2 multicenter, open-label clinical trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of two
      of three potential doses/schedules of oral seliciclib in patients with newly diagnosed,
      persistent, or recurrent Cushing disease. Up to 29 subjects will be treated with up to 800
      mg/day oral seliciclib for 4 days each week for 4 weeks and enrolled in sequential cohorts
      based on efficacy outcomes. The study will also evaluate effects of seliciclib on quality of
      life and clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing disease.

             two months prior to screening and must agree to continue the oral contraceptive
             throughout the course of the study and for 3 months after the study has ended. Male
             patients who are sexually active are required to use condoms during the study and for

             increased reproductive risk with the study drugs)

             treatment to seliciclib for the tumor

             baseline visit

          -  Patients who have been treated with radionuclide at any time prior to study entry

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to seliciclib

          -  Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable or will be unable to complete the entire study
