  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research is to improve the care of community dwelling patients
      with dementia and their family caregivers through an innovative model of supportive care that
      combines an existing, evidence-based intervention for dementia care with an innovative
      intervention for palliative care in dementia. The intervention projects this care into the
      homes of patients and caregivers, empowering caregivers, and integrating with ongoing care.
      IN-PEACE will enroll 200 patient-caregiver dyads, randomizing 100 dyads each to the
      intervention and usual care arms and follow for 24 months with quarterly outcome assessments.
      The core of the multi-component intervention is regular, proactive telephone contact by a
      dementia care coordinator (DCC; social worker or RN) to anticipate and identify patients'
      symptoms and caregivers needs and address by utilizing specific, evidence-based protocols.
      Protocols cover basic dementia care, caregiver distress, neuropsychiatric symptoms, pain,
      navigating the hospital, feeding difficulties, and transition to hospice. The intervention
      also involves advance care planning and support with caregivers tailored to decisions faced
      in dementia care, highlighting where palliative care options can replace the default that
      often results in burdensome treatments.

      The primary aim of IN-PEACE is to test the effect of the intervention on patients'
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. Other aims include testing the effect of IN-PEACE on patients'
      overall symptom outcomes, caregiver mood and distress, and the provision of burdensome
      treatments to patients (hospitalizations and emergency room visits).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is an increasingly prevalent, costly and burdensome condition. The dramatic aging of
      the US population is creating a dementia &quot;epidemic&quot; that our health care system is poorly
      prepared to handle. More than 5 million people are affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
      related dementias in 2016, with that number estimated to nearly triple to 13.8 million by
      2050. The direct health care costs alone for dementia care are projected to increase from
      $236 billion in 2016 to more than $1 trillion in 2050. In addition to cognitive and
      functional deterioration, patients with dementia experience behavioral and psychological
      complications such as agitation and depression. Family caregivers of patients with dementia
      experience higher levels of anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue, and an increased mortality
      risk.

      Dementia and palliative care are national research priorities. Both dementia and palliative
      care have been identified as priority conditions for research and quality improvement by
      numerous organizations such as the Institute of Medicine, National Quality Forum, the Centers
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and NIA.
      In addition, a workgroup developing milestones for care and support under the U.S. National
      Alzheimer's Plan has explicitly stated that palliative care needs to be incorporated
      throughout the course of caring for patients and families affected by dementia.

      2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms
      (e.g., agitation/aggression, anxiety, repetitive behaviors). Mixed effects models will be
      used to compare repeated NPI-Q scores obtained at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months.
      Repeatedly measured NPI-Q scores will be the dependent variable in the model.

      Aim 2: To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on patients' overall symptom outcomes.
      Analyses in this aim will use repeatedly measured SM-EOLD scores over 24 months of follow-up
      as the dependent variable in the mixed effects model, similarly to the approach described for
      Aim 1.

      Aim 3: To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on caregivers' distress and mood. Aim
      3 analyses will use repeatedly measured caregiver NPI-Q distress scores and caregiver PHQ-9
      over 24 months of follow-up as the dependent variables in separate mixed effects models,
      similar to the approach for Aim 1.

      Aim 4: Evaluate the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on ER/hospital use.
      ER/hospitalization events will be obtained from accessing electronic medical records
      maintained by the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) and the Indiana Network for
      Patient Care (INPC). Poisson regression models will be used to compare rates of any
      ER/hospitalization event between the two groups while adjusting for dementia severity and
      significant baseline variables that differ between the two groups.

    <description>To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation/aggression, anxiety, repetitive behaviors). Repeatedly measured NPI-Q scores will be the dependent variable in the model. Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire is a questionnaire completed by caregivers about patients designed to measure both neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver stress. There were 12 symptoms included in NPI-Q. Each domain includes an initial response of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If &quot;yes&quot;, then the caregiver rates the severity of the symptom on a 3-point scale and caregiver distress in a 5-point scale. The NPI-Q provides a total severity score ranged 0-36 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Symptom Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>0-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on patients' overall symptom outcomes. Analyses in this aim will use repeatedly measured Symptom Management - End of Life for Dementia (SM-EOLD) scores as the dependent variable in the mixed effects model. Symptom Management in End of Life Dementia (SM-EOLD) is a 9-item scale that measures comfort in patients with advanced dementia. The symptoms assessed are pain, fear, depression, anxiety, dyspnea, agitation, skin breakdown, resistance to care, and calm (reverse scored). For each symptom, the frequency over the preceding 90 days is reported by a caregiver on a scale of 0 to 5 (daily, several days a week, once a week, 2 or 3 days a month, once a month, never). The SM-EOLD score is constructed by summing the value of each item, and ranges from 0-45 with higher scores indicating better symptom control.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Mood, Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>0-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To test the effect of the IN-PEACE intervention on caregivers' distress and mood. Analyses will use repeatedly measured caregiver Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) distress scores and caregiver Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) over 24 months of follow-up as the dependent variables in separate mixed effects models. See above for NPI-Q. The NPI-Q distress score is constructed by summing the values of the distress score of each symptom and ranges from 0-60 with higher score indicating more distress.
PHQ-8 is a 8-item depression scale with a total score ranging from 0 to 24 with higher score indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>
