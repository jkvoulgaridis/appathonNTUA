  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) consists of a triad of gait disturbance, cognitive
      deterioration, and urinary incontinence and is characterized by enlarged cerebral ventricles.
      Current treatment recommendations are based on surgical diversion of Cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF), by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. When patients are appropriately selected, shunting
      for NPH has a sustained effect in one-half to two-thirds of patients with a reasonable
      complication rate. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of shunt surgery consists largely
      of observational studies with relatively short-term follow-up.

      With regards to the adverse effects of shunting, even though decreased substantially in
      recent years, shunt complications are still common. Recent studies report ten to twenty-two
      percent of serious adverse effects following shunt surgery, mainly subdural hematoma (SDH)
      requiring surgery, infection, and cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Most complication occur
      in the first year after the procedure. Many others suffer from adverse events that considered
      non-serious, such as postural headache and asymptomatic SDH.

      Since shunt complications are common and potentially severe, there is a need for a better way
      to identify those patients that will likely benefit from shunting, and find alternative
      treatments for those unwilling or unable to withstand surgery.

      Acetazolamide has been shown to reduce the production of CSF in clinical cases of raised
      intracranial pressure. It is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). Intuitively, acetazolamide can be effective
      for the treatment of NPH by reducing the volume of CSF in the brain, and serve as a medical
      alternative to shunting. Few case reports and small series demonstrated improvement in MRI
      abnormalities in NPH-patients after administrating the medication.

      This open-label study will examine the feasibility and effectiveness of acetazolamide in
      NPH-diagnosed patients who are shunt-candidates. Patients will be treated from time of
      diagnosis, and gait and cognition will be evaluated after 2-6 weeks. This trial would
      possibly pave the way to a larger randomized placebo-controlled trials, and perhaps offer a
      medical alternative to surgery for elderly patients and for patients for which operation is
      contraindicated.

    <description>Patients will be assign and treated by acetazolamide from time of allocation until surgery (2-6 weeks after treatment initiation). The maximal dose of acetazolamide will be the same dose used to treat glaucoma, considering similarity of patients' characteristics, such as age and polypharmacy. We will start at a low dose of 250 mg once a day, and increase it slowly to a maximal dose of 500 mg twice a day. Dose will be individualized according to side-effects and tolerability. Renal and liver function tests will be performed before initiation of treatment, and will be examined again two weeks after treatment had begun.</description>
