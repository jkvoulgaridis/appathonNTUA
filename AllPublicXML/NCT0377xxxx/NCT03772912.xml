  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-market observational registry is to collect additional data on the
      safety and effectiveness of the HEMOBLAST™ Bellows device in total knee arthroplasty
      procedures.

      A maximum of 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 centers in the United States.

      Enrollment occurs intraoperatively after confirmation of eligibility criteria. Data
      collection will occur during the surgical procedure as well as during patient follow up and
      will follow site standard of care. Subjects will be discontinued from the study after
      completion of the final follow up visit. The estimated duration of the study is approximately
      10 months from the time of first subject enrollment to completion of the last subject follow
      up.

    <description>The HEMOBLAST™ Bellows hemostatic agent consists of a bellows pre-loaded with 1.65g of powder composed of collagen, chondroitin sulfate, and thrombin (1500 IU). HEMOBLAST™ Bellows is indicated in surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis when control of minimal, mild, and moderate bleeding by conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical, except in neurosurgical, ophthalmic, and urological procedures.</description>
