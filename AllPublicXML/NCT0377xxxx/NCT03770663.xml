  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) is one of the most severe inflammatory myopathy (IM), due to
      pulmonary involvement (interstitial lung disease, ILD). Until now, the most commonly used
      immunosuppresive therapy in Europe is Cyclophosphamide followed by different
      immunosuppressive drugs as maintenance therapy, including Azathioprine (and so called &quot;
      European Strategy &quot;). In the USA however, the first-line immunosuppressive treatment is
      Tacrolimus (so called &quot; American Strategy &quot;). None of these two different strategies has ever
      been studied prospectively, and there is no clear comparison of short and long-term treatment
      efficacy and tolerance. Thus, there are yet no evidences helping the clinicians in the
      therapeutic management of patients with ASS-related ILD.

      The aim of this study is therefore to compare both strategies as first line treatments or in
      relapsing patients : CATR.PAT study is a 52 weeks, randomized, comparative, controlled,
      open-labeled, phase III, therapeutic clinical trial, comparing two treatment strategies.&quot;

      &quot;During the study period, according to randomization into two groups (n=38 patients,
      respectively), patients will receive either:

      - Group 1 &amp; 2 : 3 IV pulses of Methylprednisolone (7.5 mg/kg/day followed by tapering doses
      of oral Prednisone, started at 1 mg/kg/day from D4 to M12

      In association with :

        -  Group 1 : European Standard of care :

           6 IV pulses of Cyclophosphamide (1000 mg) followed from M5 to M12 by oral Azathioprine
           (2 mg/kg/day), with a maximum of 150 mg/d)

        -  Group 2 : American Strategy Tacrolimus is given orally from M0 to M12 (started at the
           initial dose of 2x2mg/d). Tacrolimus doses are regularly adapted to its serum
           concentration to reach 5-15 ng/ml.&quot;
