      ABSTRACT Objective: This randomized controlled double-blinded experimental study was carried
      out to determine the effects of daily exercise program on bone mineral density and cortisol
      level in preterm infants with very low birth weight matched for birth weight, gestation week,
      and gender.

      Study design: The study was performed with preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal
      intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Ethical committee approval, institutional
      permission, parental written consent were obtained. Daily exercise program was implemented in
      preterm infants in the exercise group for 30 days, once a day, and continuing for 7-10
      minutes. Before and after the study the following were evaluated in preterm infants in the
      exercise and control group: anthropometric measurements, tibia speed of sound (SOS) for bone
      mineral density, serum biochemical parameters and cortisol levels.

    <description>To measure SOS values, the preterm infant was placed on his/her back and his/her right leg was placed to obtain an angle of 900. The middle of the medial malleolus and distal patella apex was found and then gel was poured between the skin and the probe. The probe was put parallel to the bone to contact the point determined to be in the middle of the tibia and was moved from inside the leg. Afterward, the probe was placed from outside the leg toward the inside. In this study, The SOS from tibia was measured.</description>

    <description>Daily exercise program involved &quot;Range of Motion (ROM) exercises against extremity resistances&quot; and &quot;extension and flexion in upper and lower extremities.&quot; Exercises were implemented on wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles, knees, and hip joints of the infants by the same researcher (YSE). The daily exercise program was repeated 5-8 times, 1 session/day (a similar time of the day), for 30 days. Each session continued for 7-10 minutes.</description>
