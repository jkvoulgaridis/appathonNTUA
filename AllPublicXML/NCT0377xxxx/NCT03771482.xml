      This study aims to evaluate the impact of spaced education, delivered via a smartphone
      application, on provider prescribing patterns.

      As part of a medical center educational initiative at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
      (VUMC), two educational modules will be sent to prescribing providers through either email or
      short message service (SMS) text messaging. The first educational module consists of a set of
      multiple choice questions concerning best practices for prescribing intravenous fluids in the
      inpatient and perioperative setting. This module is based upon recent literature and
      specifically derived from the results of the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal
      Events Trial (SMART) and Saline Against Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte in the Emergency
      Department (SALT-ED) trial, both published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018 and
      led by Vanderbilt investigators. Similarly, a second educational module concerning
      evidence-based pain management and opioid prescribing practices will be distributed via email
      or SMS text messaging.

      Participants will receive one question per day. If the participant does not answer the
      question correctly, they will receive the opportunity to attempt the question again after
      reviewing evidence-based education. All questions have been curated and reviewed by a panel
      of experts and piloted within VUMC for feasibility and acceptability. Key concepts are
      repeated in each module and questions are strategically ordered throughout each module to
      accomplish spaced education.
