  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if a physical barrier, created by the nasal gel Nascum®-
      Plus, is able to prevent or minimize the induction of nasal symptoms during allergen
      challenge in the Fraunhofer Allergen Challenge Chamber (ACC). Furthermore, the effect on
      soluble and cellular inflammatory markers induced by the allergic reaction will be assessed.
      Nascum®-Plus contains no active pharmaceutical ingredient, only monographed pharmaceutical
      excipients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Able and willing to give written informed consent.

          -  2. Male and female subjects, aged 18-65 years. Women will be considered for inclusion
             if they are: Not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test (see flow chart), and not
             nursing. Of non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming
             pregnant, including any female who is pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with
             documented proof of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meets clinical criteria for
             menopause and has been amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the screening
             visit).

        Of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception during the
        entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle of the female should
        be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks prior to the
        first dose of study medication until at least 72 hours after treatment -, implants,
        injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs or double-barrier methods, i.e.
        any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical
        cap).

          -  3. Body mass index between 18 and 32 kg/m²

          -  4. History of seasonal allergic rhinitis to grass pollen

          -  5. Positive skin prick test for Dactylis glomerata pollen at screening or within 12
             months prior to the screening visit.

          -  6. Normal lung function Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 80 % pred and
             FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &gt;70% at screening

          -  7. Adequate level of rhinitis symptoms in a grass pollen challenge, defined as a Total
             Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) of at least 6 (of 12) within the 2-hour grass pollen
             challenge at performed at the Screening ACC visit (V2).

          -  8. TNSS of 3 prior to entering the pollen chamber at screening.

          -  9. Non-smokers or ex-smokers since at least 6 months with a history of less than 10
             pack years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, clinical
             chemistry, hematology, urine analysis, vital signs, lung function or Electrocardiogram
             (ECG) at screening visit , which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put
             the subject at risk because of participation in the study or may influence the results
             of the study, or the subject's ability to participate in the study

             confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cystic
             fibrosis).

          -  3. History of an acute infection four weeks prior to the informed consent visit

          -  4. Specific Immunotherapy (SIT) within 2 years prior to the study

          -  6. Asthma requiring more than inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists.

          -  7. Conditions or factors, which would make the subject unlikely to be able to stay in
             the Fraunhofer ACC for 4 hours.

          -  8. Any contraindication for adrenalin use (e.g. use of local and systemic
             beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors

          -  9. Treatment with antipsychotic medications with antihistaminic effect (e.g.
             chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, clozapine, olanzapine, tioridazine)

          -  10. Use of any medications according to section 8.2 in the period indicated before
             allergen challenge
