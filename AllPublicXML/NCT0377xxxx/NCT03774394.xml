  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk
      of atherothrombotic events. Clopidogrel is the most widely used platelet P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, despite its benefits, many
      patients still experience recurrent atherothrombotic events. The proposed study will test the
      central hypothesis that in DM patients the presence of CKD reduces clopidogrel-mediated P2Y12
      inhibitory effects through synergistic mechanisms, which include upregulation of the P2Y12
      signaling pathway and impaired clopidogrel metabolism.

    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and coexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at
      increased risk of atherothrombotic events, underscoring the importance of secondary
      prevention antiplatelet therapy in these high-risk patients. Clopidogrel is the most widely
      used platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
      However, despite its clinical benefits, many patients still experience recurrent
      atherothrombotic events. This is in part due to the impaired effects of clopidogrel in DM
      patients, particularly among those with coexisting CKD. However, underlying mechanism(s)
      leading to magnification of impaired clopidogrel response among DM patients with CKD remain
      unexplored. The ever growing prevalence of CKD in patients with DM and their high risk of
      recurrent events underscores the need to define such mechanism(s) as this may set the basis
      for identifying treatment regimens leading to more effective platelet inhibition and
      cardiovascular protection in these high-risk patients. The proposed study will test the
      central hypothesis that in DM patients the presence of CKD reduces clopidogrel-mediated P2Y12
      inhibitory effects through synergistic mechanisms, which include upregulation of the P2Y12
      signaling pathway and impaired clopidogrel metabolism. Comprehensive pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic assessments, including ex vivo and in vitro experiments, evaluating the
      impact of CKD on antiplatelet drug response in DM patients are proposed.
