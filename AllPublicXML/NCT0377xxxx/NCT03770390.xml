  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to characterize the cardiorespiratory functional gain in
      patients with pectus excavatum following corrective surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To measure the quality of life of patients operated on for pectus excavatum

        -  Identify and describe post-operative complications

        -  Follow-up on the body mass index changes post-surgery

        -  Evaluate intraoperative hemodynamic parameters before and after the retrosternal bar is
           placed non-invasively
