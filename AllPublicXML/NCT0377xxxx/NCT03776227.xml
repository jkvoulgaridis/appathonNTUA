      Primary Objective:

      To determine the bioequivalence of a single dose of one tablet of sotagliflozin (test)
      compared to two tablets of sotagliflozin (reference) under fasting conditions in healthy male
      and female subjects

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin following administration
           of one tablet sotagliflozin (test) compared to two tablets of sotagliflozin (reference)
           in healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of one tablet sotagliflozin (test) compared to two
           tablets of sotagliflozin (reference) administered under fasted conditions in healthy
           male and female subjects

      Study duration per participant is approximately 103 days including a screening period up to
      21 days before first dose, 4 periods of dosing and pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling each lasting
      7 days, a washout period of 8-21 days between dosing, and an end of study visit 10-15 days
      after the last dose.

             ≤450 ms if female and normal ECG tracing unless the Investigator considers an ECG
             tracing abnormality to be not clinically relevant.
