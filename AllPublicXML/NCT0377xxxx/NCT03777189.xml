    <textblock>
      This study aims to perform an open-series pilot trial to examine the efficacy of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy delivered in a guided self-help format (CBTgsh) with added
      content related to physical activity (PA), for the treatment of binge-eating disorder (BED),
      operationalized as BED full diagnostic criteria or BED with the full criteria except for the
      binge episode size criterion.
