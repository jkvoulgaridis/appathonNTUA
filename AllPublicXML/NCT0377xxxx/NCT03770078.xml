    <measure>Trans Epidermal Water Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trans epidermal water loss is an objective skin measurement that is measures the evaporation of water on the skin surface using a probe (DermaLab).The trans epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always aloss of water from the skin due to evaporation. When the skin barrier is damaged this evaporation of water increases. Thus, transepidermal water loss can be used to assess skin damage</description>
