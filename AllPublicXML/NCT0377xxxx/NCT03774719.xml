  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if trainees can accurately rule out dilation of the renal collecting
      system on ultrasound (hydronephrosis) using hand-carried ultrasound (HCU). Trainees will
      undergo a short ultrasound training program. Patients will be adults that are hospitalized
      and have acute or subacute kidney dysfunction. The investigators will assess sensitivity,
      specificity, positive and negative predictive value of HCU compared to radiology performed
      ultrasound, and calculate potential cost savings to the patient and to the healthcare system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand-carried ultrasound is an increasingly popular imaging modality and is widely used by
      emergency physicians, intensivists, trauma doctors and cardiologists. Renal ultrasonography
      is commonly ordered for patients with acute kidney injury, with a main focus on identifying
      obstruction of the collecting system, a rare but potentially reversible cause of acute kidney
      injury.

      This study's aim is to evaluate if nephrology and internal medicine trainees can accurately
      rule out dilation of the renal collecting system on ultrasound (hydronephrosis) using
      hand-carried ultrasound (HCU). Trainees will undergo a short, uniform and well described
      ultrasound training program. Patients will be adults that are hospitalized and have acute or
      subacute kidney dysfunction. The investigators will assess sensitivity, specificity, positive
      and negative predictive value of HCU compared to radiology performed ultrasound, and
      calculate potential cost savings to the patient and to the healthcare system.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Direct costs of hand-carried ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Direct costs in $ of hand-carried ultrasound will be calculated and compared to the costs of radiology performed ultrasound. For hand-carried ultrasound, this will include costs of purchasing the device, training costs, yearly depreciation of the hand-carried ultrasound device. For radiology performed ultrasound, this will include the sonographer's fee, radiologist fee for interpretation of the result, transportation fee by hospital transport and depreciation of the ultrasound machine.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ultrasound image quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound image quality assessed by a blinded independent radiologist. The quality will be deemed either excellent, good, fair or poor by the radiologist.</description>

    <measure>Technical difficulty of the ultrasound study</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>How technically difficult was it for the trainees to obtain the images (patient intubated, obesity etc.) as graded by the trainees who performed the ultrasound scans themselves. Trainees will grade difficulty using the following measurement scale (1) Technically easy: trainee able to get clear images of both kidneys within a timeframe of 10 minutes (2) Technically challenging: Trainee able to get clear images of kidneys but requiring more than 10 minutes of scanning time (3) Technically difficult: trainee unable to get clear images of both kidneys independent of time spent scanning.</description>
