  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a positive psychology intervention
      paired with a health behavior intervention is successful in decreasing perceived stress and
      increasing positive affect in residents of Vance and Granville County. Participants will
      attend 4 classes that occur once a week. The first class will focus on nutrition, the second
      class will focus on exercise, the 3rd class will focus on tobacco use, and the 4th class that
      will review the previous 3 classes and help participants incorporate the strategies taught in
      the Destress for Health Program into their everyday lives. The duration of each class is 1
      hour and the classes will be held once a week for a total of 4 weeks. Participants in this
      research study will be asked to complete 2 surveys. The first survey will occur during class
      1, and will ask participants about their demographic information, health behaviors, stress
      levels, emotions, and behaviors. The second survey will be conducted over the phone and will
      occur 30-days after the final class and will ask participants about their health behaviors,
      stress levels, emotions, behaviors and also about whether or not they felt the classes they
      attended were useful to them. Total study duration is about 2 months.

    <description>The program will consist of 4 in person sessions that are based on empirically supported Positive Psychosocial Well-Being PPWB components including Optimism, Mindfulness, Positive Reprisal as well as Strengths-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (SBCBT) to improve behavioral self-regulation towards health-related goals. Research staff will conduct face-to-face surveys with participants at baseline and at end of program. Finally, we will conduct a phone-based survey 30 days after program completion to assess sustainability of intervention effects.</description>
