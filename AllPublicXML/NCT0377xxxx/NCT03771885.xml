    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years at screening.

          -  Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at least 6 months prior to screening
             according to SLICC 2012 criteria; at least 4 criteria must be documented.

          -  Positive test results for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) (human epithelial cell-2 ANA
             greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 1:80) and/or anti-dsDNA antibody at the Screening visit.
             To be performed by Central Laboratory.

          -  At screening visit a &quot;clinical&quot; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index
             (2K), (SLEDAI 2K) score of ≥ 4 points. The &quot;clinical&quot; score is the SLEDAI 2K
             assessment score without the inclusion of points attributable to any blood laboratory
             results including immunologic measures. Neurologic descriptors of the SLEDAI 2K are
             not counted towards the SLEDAI 2K study entry criteria.

          -  Has received all scheduled vaccines according to local guidelines and Investigator
             judgement. Live or live-attenuated virus vaccines are not permitted within 1 month
             prior to screening or during screening. For all other vaccines there must be at least
             2 weeks between the vaccination(s) and the date of randomization at Day 1.

          -  For male patients: Men who are permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy are not
             required to use contraception. Men whose partner (or potential partner) is a women of
             childbearing potential*, for the duration of the study (including 30 days after the
             last dose of study drug) must use a condom. For female patients: Women of childbearing
             potential* must be willing and able to use a double-barrier contraception (barrier in
             the meaning of method) with at least one highly effective method of birth control per
             ICH M3(R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly for the duration of the study including 4 weeks after the
             last dose of study drug. Medically accepted methods of contraception in this study
             are:

               -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation in combination with male condom.

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal birth control associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  in combination with male condom.

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD) and intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) in
                  combination with male condom Or

                    -  The patient must have only vasectomized sexual partner(s) (vasectomy at
                       least 1 year prior to enrolment), Or

                    -  The patient must follow true abstinence from male-female sex. This is
                       defined as being in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                       patient. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                       post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of
                       exposure to IMP; and withdrawal are not acceptable.

                         -  A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile,
                            following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless
                            permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include
                            hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. Tubal
                            ligation is NOT a method of permanent sterilisation. A postmenopausal
                            state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
                            medical cause.
