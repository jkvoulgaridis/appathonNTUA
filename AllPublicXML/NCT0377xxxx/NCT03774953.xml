    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to reduce the patient's loss of lean body mass by
      protein supplementation during hospitalization and 60 days after hospital discharge. Also,
      the study aims to reduce the risk of readmission to the hospital due to relapse or
      complications and thereby improving the overall health for the patients.

      The intervention group will receive protein supplementation during hospitalization and after
      discharge, while the control group will continue their normal diet.

    <textblock>
      Infections are globally the biggest cause of mortality. In Denmark community acquired
      pneumonia is one of the most common causes for infections in patients. Mortality in pneumonia
      has been stable high over the past 10 years. Therefore, it is relevant to look at improving
      the prognosis of these patients. After a longer period of hospitalization, patients generally
      have a poor condition with loss of body weight and lean body mass. Hereafter, patients must
      often undergo a longterm rehabilitation period and they become inactive and fatigue.

      This is a threat for the patients, due to the fact that there is a higher risk of
      complications and readmissions.

      Proteins are the body's building blocks. Thus, supplementing patients with a daily higher
      protein content, it is believed to reduce their loss of lean body mass, and thereby reduce
      the total loss of body weight as well. Protein supplementation together with vitamin- and
      mineral supplementation is thought to improve all these health risk markers for the patients.

      Methods:

      Inclusion: 40 men and women &gt;60 years hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia
      Intervention: The patients will be randomized to either the control- or intervention group.
      They will receive the same treatment and care, the only difference is that the patients in
      the intervention group will receive protein- and vitamin supplementation.
