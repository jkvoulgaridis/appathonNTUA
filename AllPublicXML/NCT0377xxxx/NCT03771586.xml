        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a body weight ≥50 kg and body mass index ≥18.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2 at
             screening.

          2. If female, subject is post-menopausal (at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
             with confirmatory follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 mIU/mL), or surgically sterile
             (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, and/or hysterectomy).

          3. Subject is healthy with no history or evidence of clinically relevant medical
             disorders as determined by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a history or presence of any psychiatric disease or condition including
             suicidal ideation or behavior, has answered YES to any question on the C-SSRS at
             screening or admission, or is currently at risk of suicide in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          2. Subject has a history or presence of a neurologic disease or condition, including but
             not limited to epilepsy, closed head trauma with clinically significant sequelae, or a
             prior seizure.

          3. Subject has a family history of epilepsy.

          4. Subject has obstructed venous access and/or has skin disease, rash, acne, or abrasion
             at venous access site that may affect the ability to obtain a PK sample or affect the
             ability to receive the ketamine infusions.

          5. Subject has had previous exposure to or is known to be allergic to ketamine or any of
             its excipients.
