  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies had stated that the coeliac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is a safe and effective
      treatment method of pain associated with pancreatic cancer. The neurolytic injectate is
      usually alcohol 50-100%; however, phenol &gt;5% is also possible to use. Nowadays, there are
      several techniques to access the coeliac plexus (per cutaneous using fluoroscopy or computed
      tomographic imaging (CT), surgical and endoscopic ultrasound). However, the percutaneous
      computed tomography guided technique is the gold standard technique, it has multiple
      drawbacks as availability and cost of imaging modality, exposure to radiation and multiple
      complications.Surgical technique in spite of being easy, cheap but there is a controversy
      about its efficacy. Also there is no head to head comparison between the surgical technique
      and the percutaneous technique.In this study we hypothesized that intraoperative technique
      has the same efficacy of percutaneous celiac block technique with less complication and cost

      This study aimed to compare the efficacy of the surgical technique versus the per cutaneous
      computed tomographic guided technique of celiac plexus neurolysis for pain management in
      unresectable pancreatic cancer . all patients suffering from pain of pancreatic cancer with
      VAS≥5 undergoing laparotomy and proved to be unresectable either undergoing biopsy or bypass
      surgery will receive celiac plexus neurolysis either intraoperative or post operative CT
      guided . All patients will be managed by systemic analgesic if the block not sufficient . In
      this study we will give the patient the analgesic according to WHO recommendation as starting
      by non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs as diclofenac sodium, if it is not sufficient we
      will give them opioids as tramadol, and for neuropathic pain gabapentin. All drugs will be
      given with escalating dose . Failed block defined as change in VAS between VAS BASELINE AND
      ONE MONTH ≤ 3 may need to repeat the block by percutaneous technique .

    <description>Intraoperative celiac plexus neurolysis Before closure of the abdomen the surgeon will expose the aorta at the level of the celiac trunk.With the stomach retracted inferiorly, the index and second finger of the surgeon's left hand straddle the aorta with the index finger placed on the splenic artery and the second finger on the common hepatic artery. we will use of a 20- gauge spinal needle (in contrast to the usual short intravenous needle) allows better visualization and access to this area, especially in deep patients, while a 10 ml syringe permits the surgeon to control the injection with the right hand alone.(10) Twenty ml of 90 % alcohol, five ml lidocaine 2%, five mg dexamethasone will be injected in each side of the aorta after aspiration to exclude intravascular or subarachnoid injection.</description>

    <description>CT guided celiac plexus neurolysis After one week of the operation and the patient completely awake, the patient will be transferred to CT lab. The procedure will be done after attachment of basic monitors and transfusion of 500 ml saline in 20 G cannula before starting the procedure and the patient will be given 5 mg midazolam as a sedation. The procedure will be done by anesthetist and radiologist who had a good experience in celiac plexus neurolysis. In our study we will use the classic posterior bilateral approach. The patient will be in the prone position. After sterilization of the back by chlorohixidine 10 % , subcutaneous injection of 5 ml lidocaine as a local anaesthesia until a wheel will be formed then the procedure will be done. We will use 20 G Chiba needle under guidance of CT. Twenty ml of 95% alcohol , five ml lidocaine 2 % and five mg dexamethasone in each side of the aorta after aspiaration to exclude intravascular injection and subarachnoid injection</description>
