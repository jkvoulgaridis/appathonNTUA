    <textblock>
      The accuracy of ultrasound elastography for assessing liver fibrosis by measuring liver
      stiffness (elastic modulus) is better than traditional method. Elastography has certain
      advantage such as non-invasive, simple, real-time and it has been recommended by clinical
      guidelines.

      However, some chanllenging scientific problems showed up with further research and clinical
      practice. Firstly, present elastography machines can only calculate liver stiffness from
      shear wave speed or elastic modulus but ignore other physical characteristics such as tissue
      viscosity. So far, present technique simply assume liver as an idealized model with isotropic
      elasticity to assess liver fibrosis while liver is actually anisotropic and viscoelastic.
      What's more, theoretically, there are not only different solid state structures such as cell
      organization and vessel but also flowing liquid such as blood and bile. Thus, ignoring
      viscosity and evaluating elasticity only is unreasonable. In the other hand, a number of
      confounding factors have been found to influence liver stiffness measurement by elastography.
      Different pathological chang of liver including inflammation, necrosis, cholestasis and
      inhomogeneity among the individuals such as obesity, ascites, et,al. will decrease the
      accuracy of liver stiffness measurement and liver fibrosis staging by elastography.

      In fact, liver fibrosis is a dynamic process. Liver fibrosis is a reaction of compensation
      and repair for inflammation and necrosis as well as a contributing factor for liver damage.
      This dynamic process constitutes the common characteristic of chronic liver disease and
      result in the complicated biological mechanical characteristics of liver. In consequence, how
      to measure liver viscosity and elasticity respectively, and to evaluate liver fibrosis stage
      and Inflammation degree accurately during the complicated and dynamic pathological process is
      the key scientific problem demanding solution, which is also the urgent requirement of
      related fundamental research and clinical practice.

      Therefore, this project plan to apply LOGIQ E viscoelastography machine as research tool, rat
      liver fibrosis model and rat liver failure model as research object to investigate the
      correlation between liver viscoelastography measurement and liver fibrosis stage and
      Inflammation degree. The investigators also aim to assess the feasibility of using
      ulstrasound viscoelastography to evaluate liver fibrosis stage and Inflammation degree
      dynamically.
