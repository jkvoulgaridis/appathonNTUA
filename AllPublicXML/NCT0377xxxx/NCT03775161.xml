  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety, usability and performance of the V-LAP™
      System in adult subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III Heart Failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to demonstrate that the V-LAP™ implant can be positioned in the
      interatrial septum, and that Sensor pressure measurements correlate to standardized methods
      of intra-cardiac pressure measurements post-sensor implant and at the 3 month follow up
      visit. Safety will be monitored by the occurrence of adverse events throughout the trial.

             ACC/AHA or ESC Heart Failure Guidelines (guideline-directed medical therapy or GDMT),

             receptor blocker (ARB), beta-blocker (BB), and mineralocorticoid receptor blocker

             (ICD) or a pacemaker should be implanted at least 30 days prior to enrollment. If
