  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT) group for individuals with a somatic symptom disorder (i.e., Somatic Symptom
      and Related Disorders from the DSM-5). Patients with somatic symptom and related disorders
      are underserved by the medical system. Further, there is currently a paucity of research
      aimed at evaluating treatments for patients with somatic symptom disorders. The limited
      existing research literature supports CBT as an efficacious treatment in this population, but
      a standardized means of modifying CBT for somatic symptom disorders has not been developed,
      and it is unclear if group CBT is effective. In this study, the investigators will evaluate
      the effectives of a new six session CBT group designed specifically to address
      commonly-reported difficulties among individuals with somatic symptom disorders, such as
      somatic symptoms, psychological distress, and related cognitive interference. This study will
      allow us to validate a new intervention for somatic symptom disorders, and will help to fill
      the current void of evidence-supported evaluation and treatment protocols to better serve
      patients with somatic symptom disorders.
