      The PICU-Diary study is a prospective single centre pilot study in the Pediatric Critical
      Care Unit at McMaster Children's Hospital. We will evaluate the impressions of family
      caregivers and healthcare providers on the PICU Patient Diary, and its acceptability for use
      in the PICU, using mixed methods. We will assess the feasibility of assessing the impact of a
      patient diary on PICU outcomes and psychological distress in critically ill children, 1 month
      following PICU discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable need for research dedicated to exploring interventions to improve the
      psychological and functional effects of critical care admission on patients and families.
      Patient diaries are one approach that has been used in several adult critical care groups and
      has been shown to positively impact patient care by helping patients better understand their
      illness, acting as a therapeutic tool and debriefing aid, and providing an outlet for
      caregivers to participate in care plans. However, to date, there is minimal research
      available in the pediatric population.

      The specific objectives of this study are to evaluate the acceptability and impressions of a
      patient diary as a supportive measure for critically ill children in the PICU. Our secondary
      objective is to evaluate the feasibility of measuring the impact of a patient diary on
      psychological distress in critically ill children, following discharge from the PICU.

      The purpose of this diary is to support the recovery of critically ill children and their
      family members by:

        1. Helping patients understand visually and in written form as age appropriate, what has
           happened to them during their PICU stay, how ill they were, and in so doing, reduce
           anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms; AND

        2. Serving as an engagement tool to help families take on an informed, active role in their
           child's care plan.
