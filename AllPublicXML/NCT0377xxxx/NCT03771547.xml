  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today 11 percent of China's population is over the age of 65, and according to United
      Nations, it will take China just 20 years for the proportion of the elderly population to
      double to 25%. As life expectancy has increased, application of Endoscopic Retrograde
      Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in super-aged (≥80 years of age) is no longer limited with
      increasing prevalence of choledocholithiasis, and malignancy in advancing age. This
      increasing may come with more difficulty in cannulation or more complications in senior
      patients. Regarding difficult cannulation, little is known about grading difficulty in the
      elderly and its relation with adverse events. Therefore, it is time to evaluate the risk
      factors of adverse events in super-aged patients with difficult bile duct cannulation.

      AIM: To evaluate the incidence, causes, and management of difficult biliary cannulation
      during ERCP in elderly patients and its role as a risk factor for adverse events.

      METHODS: A total of 614 patients, with a mean age of 65.3±16.7 years, underwent ERCP during
      the study period, were prospectively managed and divided into two groups based on their age.
      There were 146 patients aged 80 years or older in group A with the mean age of 84±3.4 years.
      The primary outcome measurements were the difficulty grade of papilla cannulation, clinical
      outcomes, and ERCP-related complications in the two groups. The adverse events were analyzed
      by logistic regression about patient age, co-morbidities, indications, and difficult
      cannulation grading.
