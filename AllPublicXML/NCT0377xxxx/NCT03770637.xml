  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of Glucagon RTU when administered to subjects with a history of bariatric
      surgery during episodes of post-postprandial hypoglycemia. Twelve eligible subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive Glucagon RTU or placebo at the first of two clinical research
      center (CRC) visits, followed by the other treatment at the second CRC visit. Subjects will
      be randomly assigned to either Glucagon RTU or Placebo for the duration of a 12-week
      Outpatient Stage. A follow-up safety assessment visit will occur 14 to 28 days after a
      subject's last dose of study drug.

    <description>Change from Baseline in Hypoglycemia Fear Scale (HFS-2) Scores. The HFS-2 consists of two domains, Behavior, which has 15 questions, and Worry, which has 18 questions. Each question is assessed on a 5-point scale from 0=Never to 4=Almost Always. Lower scores indicate less fear of hypoglycemia, while higher scores indicate a greater level of fear.</description>

    <description>Change from Baseline in EQ-5D Score. This is a health assessment questionnaire with three domains. The first two domains of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression are scored on a 5-point scale from 1=no pain/discomfort; not anxious or depressed to 5=extreme pain or discomfort; extremely anxious or depressed. For these two domains, lower scores indicate less pain/discomfort or anxiety/depression, while higher scores indicate increasing levels of pain/discomfort or anxiety/depression. The third domain of Health is assessed with a series of 5 visual analog scales, each scored from 0-100. On these VAS scales, high scores indicate better health, while low scores indicate worse health.</description>
