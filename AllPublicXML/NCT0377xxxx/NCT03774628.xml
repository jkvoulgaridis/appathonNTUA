  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A rabies vaccine (human diploid cell) for human use, Freeze-dried produced by Chengdu Kanghua
      Biological Products Co.,Ltd is used to prevent human rabies. The vaccine was completed in the
      Phase III clinical trial from August 2008 to February 2009 in Lianshui County, Jiangsu
      Province (Approval of Drug Clinical Trial No. 2008L03156). A total of 1200 subjects aged
      10-60 years were randomly assigned trial group (Kanghua vaccine group, 600 participants) and
      control groups (Pasteur vaccine group, 600 participants). The result showed that this vaccine
      could provide good immunogenicity and mild adverse reactions. On April 28, 2012, the drug
      registration approval was obtained (Approval No. 2012S00222).

      To disclose the effects of booster immunization of human diploid cell rabies vaccine (HDCV)
      after eight years of primary vaccination. Sixty subjects who had participated the phase Ⅲ
      clinical trial of freeze-dried HDCV were selected and given booster immunization after eight
      years of primary vaccination. The result showed that the freeze-dried HDCV has good immune
      effects with one-dose of booster immunization after eight years of primary vaccination． In
      order to find a ten years of immunization persistence and booster dose immune effect, the
      investigators decided to perform this immunization persistence and booster immunity trial
      among these subjects who had received five doses of rabies vaccine vaccines (around ten years
      after the fundamental immunity). The investigators do the recruitment among these subjects
      who had participated in the previous phase Ⅲ trail and the subjects were divided into two
      layers, such as trial group (Kanghua vaccine group) and the control group (Paste vaccine
      group). Each layer of the subjects randomly received one booster dose (Day 0) and two booster
      doses (Day 0, 3) the freeze-dried HDCV in a ratio of 1:1.
