  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little data are available on the genital haemorrhages in woman of childbearing age treated
      for venous thromboembolic disease by oral anticoagulant, especially the impact on the quality
      of life. A recent systematic review in 2016 described for the first time in patients with
      venous thromboembolic a lower incidence in men of major haemorrhages and minor haemorrhages
      but clinically significant compared with women (5,3% and 7,9% respectively; RR: 0,635, 95%CI
      0,54-0,74 ; p&lt;0,001). It appears that this difference is related to genital haemorrhages and
      some direct oral anticoagulants are more associated with hemorrhagic surge. In post-hoc
      analyzes of phases III trials, rivaroxaban was most of the time associated with genital
      haemorrhages compared to vitamine K antagonists, effect not found with apixaban. Four other
      retrospective studies seem to find the same conclusions with a higher haemorrhagic risk with
      the rivaroxaban than with vitamine K antagonist or apixaban.

      However, haemorrhagic risk is defined in these studies with criteria of severity (anemia,
      transfusion, use of a health professional, menstrual periods of more than 8 days, inter
      mentrual bleeding, presence of blood clots) and these studies do not take into account of
      minor haemorrhages that may affect on the quality of life and asthenia due to anemia.

      Our objective is : 1- studying the proportion of women with abnormal genital haemorrhages
      among women of childbearing age treated for venous thromboembolism disease by oral
      anticoagulant including using a semi quantitative score of menorrhagia. 2- To compare this
      proportion according to the four molecules of oral anticoagulants (fluindione, warfarin,
      rivaroxaban and apixaban) and 3- to evaluate the impact of these haemorrhages on the quality
      of life. Our study would have a control group of women of childbearing age followed in
      vascular medicine for superficial venous insufficiency without thrombosis and without oral
      anticoagulant because the proportion of genital haemorrhages in women of childbearing age in
      PACA region is not known.
