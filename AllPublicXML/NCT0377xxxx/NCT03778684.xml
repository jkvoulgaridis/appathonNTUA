  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has been associated with menstrual irregularities, chronic an-ovulation, infertility,
      and poor outcomes in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.

      There is strong evidence that obesity is associated with a higher n vitro fertilization cycle
      cancellation rate (despite administration of higher doses of exogenous gonadotrophins), a
      lower mature oocyte yield and lower number of cryopreservation cycles.

      Furthermore, obese women have been shown to have impaired response to ovarian stimulation and
      significantly lower live births after in vitro fertilization. Indeed, obesity affects many
      ovarian intra-follicular steroidogenic, metabolic and inflammatory pathways.This is
      particularly evident in women with abdominal (central obesity). Waist circumference
      measurement is used to identify individuals with abdominal obesity but it cannot
      differentiate between intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat accumulation.

      The reliable measurement of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat is not only important as a tool
      to predict cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk, but it is also essential to evaluate
      the effect of these fat compartments on female reproductive function. Intra-abdominal fat
      accumulation is related to insulin resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and in
      these women the resulting hyperinsulinemia contributes to an-ovulation.

      Obese anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome who resume ovulation during a 6-month
      lifestyle program lose more visceral fat with no difference in the change of subcutaneous fat
      compared to the women who did not resume ovulation.

      Another recent study that enrolled 140 non-polycystic ovary syndrome in vitro fertilization
      women demonstrated that women with increased waist circumference and higher follicular fluid
      leptin have less oocytes fertilized and failed in vitro fertilization outcomes. Increased
      intra-abdominal fat during early pregnancy is associated with insulin resistance and
      increased diastolic blood pressure and it can predict glucose intolerance in later pregnancy.
