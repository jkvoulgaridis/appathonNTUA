  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hysteroscopy has now become a gold-standard technique carried out for uterine cavity
      assessment in infertile women. Apart from direct visualizing of the endometrium by the naked
      eye, pathologies missed by other modalities of investigation can be picked up and managed
      appropriately. Unfortunately, the procedure itself is not free from complications e.g.
      perforation, cervical laceration, bleeding, limited access in cases of cervical stenosis and
      considered as an invasive procedure.

      Two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography (2D-TVS)and Three-dimensional TVS (3D-TVS) are
      non-invasive methods for evaluating the uterine cavity. The3D-TVS is superior to 2D-TVS in
      identifying uterine cavity abnormalities due to its ability to obtain a view of three
      different planes of the uterus, which could be used to locate the position of intracavitary
      pathology. Reports vary regarding the diagnostic accuracy of 3D-TVS that was reported to have
      41.3-81.5% sensitivity and 94.6-98.7% specificity. So it became clear that 3D-TVS is a
      non-invasive and safe diagnostic tool for evaluation of the uterine cavity abnormalities but
      its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy still a matter of debate and warrants more
      evaluation.
