  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis (including adenomyosis) is one of the most common gynecological diseases among
      women of childbearing age. Common symptoms such as menstrual pain, excessive menstrual flow,
      infertility, chronic lower abdominal pain, and painful intercourse. According to the
      literature statistics, the prevalence of endometriosis in women of childbearing age is about
      10-20%, while the prevalence of adenomyosis is about 5%. Traditional medical treatments
      include hormones (danazol, gestrinone, oral lutein). Oral contraceptive, there is a
      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in the injection form, and a levonorgestrel-releasing
      intrauterine system in the intrauterine administration system. The choice of drugs has many
      influencing factors, such as the severity of endometriosis in patients (according to the
      classification of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine), the need for fertility,
      the convenience of drug use, and the patient's tolerance to drug side effects. Surgery is
      also one of the treatment options for endometriosis and adenomyosis, including traditional
      open or minimally invasive endoscopic ovarian cyst resection, oophorectomy, and lesion
      resection; adenomyosis surgery includes traditional methods Open abdominal, transvaginal or
      minimally invasive endoscopic hysterectomy, conservative uterine sparing adenomyomectomy and
      cytoreduction surgery (partial adenomyomectomy). For endometriosis, the common treatment
      consensus of obstetricians and gynecologists is to follow the surgical treatment of the
      lesions and then follow-up medication. For women with adenomyosis, if they have completed the
      birth, it is recommended to have a total hysterectomy, so that there is no recurrence. The
      possibility. However, for women who have not completed birth, conservative uterine
      preservation surgery is performed. According to research statistics, endometriosis or
      adenomyosis does not receive follow-up medical treatment after completion of surgical
      treatment, there is a high probability of recurrence, but the side effects caused by drugs
      will also affect the patient's compliance with medication.The Department of Women's Medicine
      of the hospital has a wealth of experience in the treatment of endometriosis and adenomyosis.
      Each year, about 500 cases of endometriosis (including adenomyosis) are performed. This study
      was designed to analyze the differences in prognosis and recurrence of patients with
      endometriosis and adenomyosis after receiving various surgical and medical treatments.
