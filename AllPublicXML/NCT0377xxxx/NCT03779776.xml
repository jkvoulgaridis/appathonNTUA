  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most prevalent longterm morbidity among surviving
      extremely preterm infants and has a multifactorial etiology. BPD is associated with later
      risk of reactive airways disease, such as asthma, post neonatal mortality and adverse
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common retinal neovascular
      disorder and a major cause of vision impairment or blindness in preterm infants, even with
      aggressed current standard care.Accumulating epidemiologic evidence suggests that vitamin D
      (VD) deficiency or insufficiency is associated with respiratory disease in children.Vitamin A
      (VA) plays an integral part in lung growth and differentiation. VA is an essential
      micronutrient for normal visual function.

      Our prospective multicenter double-blinded randomized controlled trial will include infants
      born at &lt;32 weeks' gestation and admitted to one of 2 tertiary NICUs in China. Infants in the
      intervention (vitamin AD drops) group will receive the daily dose VA at 1500 IU/day with VD
      500 IU/day, added to their enteral feeds in drop form as soon as minimal feeding was
      introduced, and continued to 28 days or discharge. Infants in the control group will receive
      an equivalent volume of a placebo solution. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will
      be randomly allocated to the control or VAD group. The primary outcome is bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD) or ROP, and the secondary outcomes are mortality; NEC ≥ stage 2; ; late-onset
      sepsis; weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference;
      time to full enteral feeds; and number and type of critical incident reports.
