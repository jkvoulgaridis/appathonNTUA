  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Butantan
      Institute Trivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in comparison with the Sanofi Trivalent
      Seasonal Influenza Vaccine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To detemine whether immunogenicity elicited by a single-dose Butantan Institute Trivalent
      Seasonal Influenza Vaccine is not inferior to that elicited by a single dose of Sanofi
      Trivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in adult and elderly populations measured by HI GMT for
      the three vaccine components 21 days post-immunization.

      To describe the safety profile of Butantan Institute Trivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine and
      Sanofi Trivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine after a single dose in adult and elderly
      populations.

    <description>Butantan Institute and Pasteur-Mérieux (present, Sanofi Pasteur) established a technology transfer in 1999 for the production of a trivalent influenza vaccine of inactivated split-virion using embryonated eggs. The technology transfer followed a progressive approach from importing the finished product, to packaging and quality control test for release (1999), and, finally, to the first batch of influenza vaccine entirely produced by Butantan (2011). In 2013, the Butantan vaccine was registered by the Brazilian National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA).</description>

    <description>VAXIGRIP® was launched in 1968 and since then has been licensed in more than 100 countries and prequalified by WHO in 2011. Several clinical studies by Sanofi Pasteur have examined the safety and immunogenicity of Vaxigrip® in older children (8-10 years), adults (18-59 years), elderly (&gt; 60 years),11,12 children (six months to three years) 13 and pregnant women.</description>

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications such as systemic corticosteroids or
             chemotherapeutics, or immunosuppressive illness. It will be considered
             immunosuppressive dose of systemic corticosteroids the equivalent to a dose ≥10 mg of
             prednisone per day for over 14 days;

          -  Women who report being pregnant or have plans to become pregnant during the study
             period;

          -  Participation in research involving another investigational product within 30 days
             before planned date of first vaccination or anytime through the last study safety
             visit;

          -  Acute febrile illness (axilar temperature ≥ 37.8°C);

          -  Hypersensitivity to egg or chicken proteins;

          -  History of Guillain-Barre Syndrome;

          -  Thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular vaccination;

          -  Unstable chronic illness (defined as illness requiring hospitalization or a clinically
             significant change in medication in the previous 12 weeks);

          -  Alcohol abuse or drug addiction;

          -  Any vaccination within the previous 4 weeks;

          -  Seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous 6 months.
