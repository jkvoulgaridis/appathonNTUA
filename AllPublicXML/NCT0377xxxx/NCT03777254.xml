  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single intravitreous injections,single ascending doses, of RC28-E(a
      chimeric decoy receptor trap fusion protein by dual blockage of VEGF and FGF-2) in subjects
      with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD).

      This is an open-label, non-randomized,double-center phase 1 study evaluating
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single intravitreal injections of RC28-E in the
      patients with AMD.RC28-E is recombinant dual decoy receptor IgG1 Fc-fusion protein,can block
      VEGF-A and FGF-2. In preclinical studies suggested that RC28-E might be more effective in
      inhibiting pathological angiogenesis than other VEGF antagonists on CNV. Every subject will
      only accept one dose. In addition to safety and preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of RC28-E will be evaluated as well.
