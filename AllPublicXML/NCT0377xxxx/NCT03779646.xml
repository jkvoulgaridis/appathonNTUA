  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of bisoprolol therapy for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy(DMD) and preserved
      ejection fraction. On top of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) , half of the
      participants will receive bisoprolol in combination, while the other half will not receive
      any beta-blocker.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By the age of 20 years, almost all the patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy(DMD) have
      experienced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition that contributes significantly to their
      morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown ACEI to be an effective therapy for DMD boys with
      early cardiomyopathy. Although bisoprolol has been demonstrated as an effective neurohumoral
      drug for adult patients with DCM, few data exist concerning its safety and efficacy for the
      patients with DMD. The investigators hypothesize that the treatment with bisoprolol in
      addition to background ACEI therapy for 12 months in participants with DMD and early
      myocardial damage evident with late gadolinium enhancement and preserved ejection fraction,
      would blunt decline in left ventricular systolic performance.

    <intervention_name>Bisoprolol Fumarate</intervention_name>
    <description>Bisoprolol was initiated at a dose of 1.25 mg every 24hr. At subsequent biweekly visits, the bisoprolol dose was increased 1.25mg progressively until a daily dose of 0.2mg/kg or the maximum tolerated dose (The rest heart rate &lt;75bpm and systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg) is achieved. If the participant feel dizziness or the rest heart rate below 60 bpm or systolic blood pressure below 85mmHg or there is any new onset contraindication to bisoprolol, the doctor will decide to return back to the previous dose or stop bisoprolol. Each time the dose is increased, the medication is administered in an outpatient clinic setting, with assessment of the participant's heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms and ECG. Once reach the target dose, the patients will be followed up every 8 weeks in an face-to-face or video visit. After 12 months , the participants will repeat cardiac MR besides heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, ECG and brain natriuretic peptide(BNP), echocardiography records.</description>
