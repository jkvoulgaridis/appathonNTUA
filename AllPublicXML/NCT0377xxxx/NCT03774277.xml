    <textblock>
      This study, the Chickasaw Healthy Eating Environments Research Study (CHEERS), will be
      conducted in partnership with Chickasaw Nation. CHEERS comprises several mutually reinforcing
      strategies to improve blood pressure (BP) control in people with hypertension. Environmental
      strategies include the investigator's innovative &quot;Packed Promise for a Healthy Heart&quot; program
      that provides hypertensive adults ages 18 and older with a voucher for fresh vegetables and
      fruits (referred to as a &quot;fresh check&quot;) and home delivered food boxes that contain Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-approved ingredients for preparing low-salt, and
      traditional healthy Chickasaw meals. The study facilitates demonstrations of healthy cooking
      practices in participating communities. At the individual level, tribal members with
      uncontrolled hypertension will receive heart-healthy recipes (available at
      getfreshcooking.com) that are tailored to traditional Chickasaw diet and culture, educational
      materials, along with invitations to attend cooking demonstrations, fresh checks to improve
      access to fresh produce, and a Chickasaw Nation culturally-informed smartphone walking app
      called &quot;AYA.&quot; At the policy level, CHEERS will culminate in a multimedia documentary
      presentation for tribal leadership detailing the intervention and featuring personal success
      stories by hypertensive community members. Study findings, including a health economics
      assessment, will be used to encourage policies for further expansion of the Packed Promise
      for a Healthy Heart Program; and policies promoting expansion of brick and mortar grocery
      outlets in rural Chickasaw communities.

      This study is guided by the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR).

      Aims and Methods: Co-led by an AI (Choctaw) Investigator, the study will:

      Aim #1: Evaluate CHEERS' ability to improve healthy food access by collecting quantitative
      data on changes in perceived ability to purchase and prepare healthy food, and by using
      qualitative methods to evaluate the reach, saturation, and acceptability of the CHEERS
      intervention.

      Aim #2: Measure the intervention's effect on change in BP and secondary outcomes among
      hypertensive community members with poorly controlled hypertension.

      Aim #3:Disseminate a multimedia documentary of the study's findings and evaluate the
      documentary's effect on tribal leaders across the Chickasaw Nation and other tribal
      communities.

      Innovation: This study will evaluate the effects of a multilevel, tribally-run, food
      environment intervention. The study will also be one of the few food environment
      interventions ever implemented in an AI community, and the first to objectively measure its
      effects on BP and BMI.

      Significance and Impact: Study findings, including a health economics assessment, will be
      used to encourage policies for further expansion of the Packed Promise for a Healthy Heart
      Program; and policies promoting expansion of brick and mortar grocery outlets in rural
      Chickasaw communities.

    <description>USDA Household Food Security Scale (6 Item Short Module) - The sum of affirmative responses provides a household raw score. Food security status of households with raw scores of 0-1 are high or marginally food secure, raw scores of 2-4 are low secure, and raw scores of 5-6 are very low food secure. High raw scores indicate food insecure households.</description>

Total scores are calculated by summing the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of walking, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity activities. High scores indicate better levels of physical activity.</description>
