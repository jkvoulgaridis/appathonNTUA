    <textblock>
      Aim of this trial is to define if Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction, detected analyzing
      changes between pre-operative and post-operative Neurocognitive Test, relate to concentration
      of effector's site concentration of propofol and remifentanil TCI and to the common
      intraoperative neuromonitoring values.

      Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction has not been yet investigated after general anaesthesia
      with Targeted-Controlled-Infusion (TCI) and Laryngeal-Mask-Airway (LMA), daily used in the
      investigator's Hospital to anesthetize women undergoing breast surgery. Aim of this trial is
      to define if neurocognitive tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test A and B,
      Digit Span Test) before and after surgery relate to concentrations at effector's site (Ec) of
      propofol and remifentanil TCI and the values of Bispectral Index and Entropy monitoring and
      Surgical Plethysmographic Index (SPI).

        Women subjected to breast surgery in general anaesthesia with Laryngeal-Mask-Airway (LMA)
        anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil delivered by Targeted-Controlled-Infusion (TCI)
        pumps. Women will be subjected to neurocognitive tests (MOCA, TMT A and B, DST) the day
        before surgery and on the first post-operative day. These test will be related to propofol
        and remifentanil concentrations at effector site during surgery and awakening, to BIS and
        Entropia values and to SPI value.
