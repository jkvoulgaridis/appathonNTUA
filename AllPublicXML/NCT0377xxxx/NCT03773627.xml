  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periperative neurocognitive disorder(PND) is consistently associated with increased morbidity
      and mortality, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Moreover, valid biomarkers for the
      prediction or diagnosis of the development of delayed neurocognitive recovery in aged
      patients have not been identified so far. The purpose of this study is trying to find the
      functional MRI marker of PND.
