  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodule patients with suggestion of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) offered by
      ultrasound are enrolled in the study. CTCs tested by Optimizing method and FNAB will be
      performed simultaneously. This is a double blind trial which pathologists and inspectors of
      CTCs don't know the result of each other. Surgical pathology and diagnostic results of FNAB
      is the primary endpoint and comparison will be made to see if CTCs combined with ultrasound
      can get similar diagnostic performance as FNAB. The diagnostic results of FNAB included
      Bethesda class II and more than V which are defined as benign and malignant, respectively.

      Some retrospective analysises showed CTCs is considered to be valuable for diagnosis,
      staging, prognosis and follow-up in several types of cancers and some mRNA markers are
      helpful in differentiating patients with benign versus malignant thyroid disease. However,
      the lack of sensitivity and specificity of mRNA measurements restricted their clinical
      application. The aim of this study is to see if optimizing test method combined with
      ultrasound can get similar diagnostic performance. 200 patients with thyroid nodules (≤2cm)
      which need to undergo FNAB will be enrolled in four centers of northern China. Patients will
      simultaneously undergo CTCs tests and FNAB. And following treatments will be performed
      according to the previous standard. Allowed by the patients, the investigators will obtain
      10ml peripheral blood samples from the participants to make a CTCs test before any FNAB. The
      primary end point is the pathologically confirmed benign versus malignant thyroid disease,
      which including surgical pathology and diagnostic results of FNAB.

    <description>Patients with malignant results of FNAB (Bethesda V and VI)non-diagnostic results of FNAB (Bethesda class I , III, IV)will be suggested to undergo surgery. Those patients who underwent surgery are enrolled in our study and are performed a post-operative pathology, which have a higher evidence rank than FNAB. According to post-operative pathology, any type of thyroid carcinoma is defined as malignant, and patients who have not been strong enough to be diagnosed with carcinoma is defined as benign disease.</description>

    <description>10 ml Peripheral blood are drawn from patients enrolled before surgery/FNAB and centrifuged to collect the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Then, negative and positive immunomagnetic selections are used to exclude white blood cells and enrich tumor cells. After isolating mRNA, RT-PCR array is used to measure expression of target genes.</description>
