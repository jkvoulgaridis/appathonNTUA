      This study is a double blind, randomized, investigator initiated study on glucose-lowering
      effects and Safety of Adding 0.25 or 0.5 mg Duvie (Lobeglitazone) in Patients With Type 2
      Diabetes With Inadequate Control on Metformin and DPP-4 Inhibitor Therapy. The primary aim of
      the study is to compared changes of HbA1c between 0.25mg robeblitazone add-on group and 0.5mg
      robeglitazone add-on group.
