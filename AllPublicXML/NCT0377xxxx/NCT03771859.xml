        Adults with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have
        undergone complete resection, and who receive adjuvant nivolumab under real-world
        conditions in Belgium or Luxembourg. Patients will be enrolled after complete surgical
        resection and following a screen procedure (according to standard practice) that shows no
        evidence of disease. Patients currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial will
        not be eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a primary diagnosis of melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or
             metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection and have no evidence of
             disease.

          -  Decision to treat with adjuvant nivolumab therapy has already been taken

          -  At least 18 years of age at the time of treatment decision

          -  Patients who provide written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with a current diagnosis of persisting advanced melanoma

          -  Any patient currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial for his/her
             melanoma treatment (note: patients who have completed their participation in an
             interventional trial or who are no longer receiving the study drug and are only
             followed up for OS/RFS can be enrolled. In case of a blinded study, the treatment arm
             needs to be known).
