  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relapsing nature of opioid use disorder is a major obstacle to successful treatment.
      About 90% of those entering treatment will relapse within one year. To improve treatment
      outcome, new interventions targeting the underlying brain biomarkers of relapse vulnerability
      hold significant promise in reducing this critical public health problem. Transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modulate
      brain connectivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive flexibility, the ability to change maladaptive behavior, depends on dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) input to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; Gruber, Hussain, and
      O'Donnell 2009). DLPFC stimulation may increase input to NAcc to facilitate proper selection
      of goal-directed behavior and may also decrease craving in individuals with substance use
      disorder (Boggio et al. 2008).

      We will use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate the DLPFC. TDCS is a
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can modulate brain connectivity. TDCS involves
      applying a weak electrical current (2mA or less) to the scalp via anodal and cathodal
      electrode sponges, causing either increases or decreases in cortical excitability,
      respectively. Research has shown in both healthy subjects and patients (e.g. Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression) that tDCS has the potential to modulate
      synaptic strengthening and neurotransmitter-dependent plasticity underlying changes in
      behavior and learning (Lang et al. 2005).

      We are anticipating enrollment of 30 participants. Fifteen participants will be randomly
      assigned to the interventional tDCS condition, while 15 participants will be randomly
      assigned to sham tDCS. Both conditions will undergo five sessions of tDCS across five days.
      Participants will undergo pre- and post-tDCS MRI scans, in addition to clinical interviews
      and questionnaires. Follow-up interviews will be conducted in person 1 and 2 months after
      intervention completion to inquire about relapse status.

    <description>TDCS will be performed with Neuroelectrics Starstim Enobio 20, an approved research device without an investigational device exemption due to meeting criteria for non-significant risk. It has built-in safety mechanisms which allow for immediate cessation of stimulation if the subject becomes uncomfortable. The current will be administered via two electrode sponges for 25 mins with 1-2 milliamperes. These administration protocols are in line with protocols that have outlined safe administration (Nitsche 2007; 2008). No side-effects have been reported with the exception of slight itching under the electrode and occasional occurrence of headache, fatigue, or nausea (Poreisz 2007). Electrodes placement: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); cathode on left DLPFC, anode on right DLPFC.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  20 abstinent individuals (18-60 years old; 1-2 weeks of abstinence) who meet DSM-V
             criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD) will be recruited from the Lodging Plus
             Program, part of University of Minnesota Medical Center

          -  This 28-day program provides a supervised environment to treat individuals with OUD in
             which patients receive random drug screenings. Lodging Plus has 50 beds and admits an
             average of 20 patients per week and about 50% of patients admitted have a diagnosis of
             opioid use disorder.

          -  Ability to provide written consent and comply with study procedures, meet the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria for
             OUD. Subjects may have current comorbid drug use, but their primary substance use
             disorder diagnosis needs to be based on opioid use. Subjects must have the intention
             to remain in the Lodging Plus program (4 weeks) until the end of the intervention
             portion of the study. Vulnerable populations will not be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition or treatment with neurological sequelae (i.e. stroke, tumor,
             loss of consciousness&gt;30 min, HIV)

          -  A head injury resulting in a skull fracture or a loss of consciousness exceeding 30
             minutes (i.e., moderate or severe TBI)

          -  Any contraindications for tDCS or MRI scanning (tDCS contraindication: history of
             seizures; MRI contraindications; metal implants, pacemakers or any other implanted
             electrical device, injury with metal, braces, dental implants, non-removable body
             piercings, pregnancy, breathing or moving disorder)

          -  DSM-V criteria for psychiatric disorder, may have a lifetime diagnosis of depression

          -  Presence of a condition that would render study measures difficult or impossible to
             administer or interpret

          -  Age outside the range of 18 to 60

          -  Primary current substance use disorder diagnosis on a substance other than opioid
             except for caffeine or nicotine

          -  Clinical evidence for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome

          -  Nicotine use will be recorded.
