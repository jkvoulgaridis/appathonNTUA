      UCLA researchers looking for healthy individuals (age 45-60) to participate in a study
      investigating whether an anti-inflammatory medication can impact daily life, including mental
      and physical health, and the immune system.

      Everyday for four weeks, participants will take either an anti-inflammatory medication
      (naproxen) twice daily, or a placebo pill twice daily. Participants will also answer daily
      questions during the 4-week period. Participants will also come to the UCLA campus twice for
      blood draws, to fill out questionnaires, and complete a few tasks on the computer: once prior
      to the 4-week period and once immediately after the 4-week period.

      Participants (ntotal=100) will be men and women, ages 45-60. All interested participants will
      first complete a structured telephone interview in order to assess eligibility.

      The study will begin with a session lasting approximately three hours, in which you will
      complete a blood draw, fill out questionnaires, and complete some tasks. You will then be
      randomly assigned to take either an anti-inflammatory medication (naproxen) or placebo
      (inactive substance) to take twice daily everyday for the following four weeks. You will also
      be contacted by text message to remind you to take your pills, to ask if you have taken your
      pills, and to send you a link to fill out questionnaires once daily. After the four weeks are
      over, you will come back in for a second session lasting approximately three hours to again
      complete a blood draw, fill out questionnaires, and complete some tasks. Two weeks after the
      second session, you will receive an email to fill out questionnaires online. Finally, four
      weeks after your second session, you will receive another email to fill out questionnaires
      online.
