    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        In compliance with AAPD, 2017 guidelines for pulp therapy &quot;IPT is indicated in a primary
        tooth with no pulpitis or with reversible pulpitis when the deepest carious dentin is not
        removed to avoid a pulp exposure. The pulp is judged by clinical and radiographic criteria
        to be vital and able to heal from the carious insult&quot;

        In addition to:

        I-Subjects:

          1. Medically free children, their parent(s) accepts to sign the informed consent.

          2. Age range from 4-8 years.

        II-Molars:

          1. Presence of at least 1 primary molar with deep carious lesion extending to more than
             one half of the dentin on radiographic examination (to make the trial regardless of
             number of carious molars).

          2. Clinically: Normal mobility and normal appearance of gingiva (vital teeth).

          3. Radiographically: Normal roots without physiological resorption, normal lamina dura
             and normal periodontal membrane space (indicated for IPT).

        Exclusion criteria:

        I-Subjects:

          1. Uncooperative children.

          2. Parents unable to attend follow up visits (even after explaining the importance of
             recall visits).

        II-Molars:

          1. History of spontaneous pain (to exclude reversible pulpitis).

          2. Clinically: Presence of swelling, sinus, fistula or tooth mobility (to exclude non
             vital teeth).

          3. Radiographically: Presence of radiolucent lesions at furcation or periapical region or
             external or internal resorption (to exclude teeth not indicated for IPT).
