      Determine the association between duration and dose of chronic conventional therapy with Pi
      and renal (nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis), vascular (endothelial function), and
      cardiovascular function (echo- cardiography) in patients with hereditary hypophosphatemic
      rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) and patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia
      (XLH), when matched for duration and dose of phosphate (Pi) therapy to patients with
      hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH), will evidence greater
      cardiovascular and vascular debility than patients with HHRH. The overall objectives of this
      project are to utilize our existing longitudinal databases for individuals with XLH and HHRH
      through an interdisciplinary collaboration between pediatric and adult endocrinology to: i)
      quantify the impact of exposure to Pi therapy across the lifespan on cardiovascular and renal
      complications, which are key aging endpoints, ii) determine the acute response to Pi loading
      in XLH and HHRH by studying the changes in surrogate markers of cardiovascular and renal
      function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded, if they are children younger than age 13 years

          -  Subjects that have other diseases likely to impact bone and mineral metabolism (e.g.

          -  Subjects that received medical therapy or developed any condition, which in the
             opinion of the investigator, could present a concern for either subject safety or
             difficulty with data interpretation.

          -  Subjects will be excluded from Aim 2, if they are unable to tolerate supplemental
             phosphate.
