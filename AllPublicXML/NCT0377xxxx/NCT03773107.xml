      The primary objective of Phase I is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone. The primary objective of phase
      II is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months in multiple myeloma subjects
      who receive the combination treatment carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and ruxolitinib.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of carfilzomib, ruxolitinib, and low-dose
      dexamethasone for carfilzomib-refractory multiple myeloma. Phase I is designed to evaluate
      overall maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone in the following cohorts: Cohort 1) 5mg ruxolitinib, Cohort 2) 10mg
      ruxolitinib, Cohort 3) 15mg ruxolitinib. Phase II is designed to evaluate 4-month
      progression-free survival (PFS) in the following cohorts: Cohort A) non-responders to Phase I
      regimen, Cohort B) responders to Phase I regimen. Up to 18 evaluable subjects will be
      enrolled in Phase I over approximately 12 months. An additional 30 evaluable subjects will be
      enrolled in Phase II over 24 months.

               2. Urinary M-protein excretion of ≥200 mg over a 24-hour period

               3. Involved free light chain level ≥10 mg/dL, along with an abnormal free light
                  chain ratio

          3. Adequate bone marrow reserves, as defined by the following:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000 cells/mm3 within 1 week of the initiation
                  of treatment

               2. Platelet count of ≥75 ,000 cells/mm3 for subjects who have bone marrow
                  plasmacytosis of &lt;50%, or ≥50,000 cells/mm3 for subjects who have bone marrow
                  plasmacytosis of &gt;50%

          4. Adequate hepatic function, as defined by the following:

          5. Adequate renal function, as defined by the following: creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30
             mL/min., as measured by a 24-hour urine collection, or estimated by the Cockcroft and
             Gault formula.

          6. Adequate cardiac function defined as LVEF ≥ 40% by MUGA, echocardiogram or cardiac
             MRI.
