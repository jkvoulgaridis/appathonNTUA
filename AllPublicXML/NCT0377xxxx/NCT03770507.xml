  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand how different kinds of exercise affect
      the human body and the health of the heart and lungs. For example, some people like to
      exercise continuously for relatively long periods of time while others like to exercise for
      short periods of time with rest periods in between. Children tend to exercise in frequent
      bouts of brief exercise interspersed with periods of rest. Also, some people like running or
      treadmill exercise while others like to work out on stationary bicycles. To date, standard
      exercise testing is based on a century-old paradigm used predominantly for adults that
      involves maximal exercise protocols (cardiopulmonary exercise testing-CPET). Moreover,
      different but widely used exercise modalities such as cycle ergometer and treadmills are
      currently impossible to compare in children, and this has limited the clinical and research
      application of such testing in the pediatric age-range. A major premise of this laboratory is
      that laboratory testing of cardiopulmonary fitness in children should be based on protocols
      that mimic naturally occurring patterns of exercise in children, rather than those that have
      been artificially employed to assess maximal efforts in adults. This research project
      designed to begin the process of systematically identifying protocols can be best used for
      children and young adults. Participants will exercise in different protocols on a bicycle
      ergometer or treadmill. This research could lead to improved and more accurate fitness
      assessment and pave the way to an improved personalized exercise program in health and
      illness.
