    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, placebo controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover
      study to determine the effects of MEDI6012 on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100)
      lipoproteins in individuals with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis, characterized by excess fat deposit in arteries, is a progressive and
      life-threatening condition. Therefore, treatments that can remove fat deposits from the
      arteries are being developed. These treatments may prevent subsequent heart attacks or other
      cardiovascular events, addressing an unmet medical need. MEDI16012 is a new drug that targets
      a substance produced by the body to assist participants in breaking down the bodies &quot;good&quot;
      fat. The investigators are interested in understanding why MEDI6012 increases the good fat,
      but also why it increases other types of &quot;bad&quot; fat such as low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C).

    <description>MEDI6012 is recombinant human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (rhLCAT), an approximately 60 kilodalton, glycosylated, single-chain protein consisting of 416 amino acids produced via Chinese hamster ovary cell culture. It is being explored as an acute treatment to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events as an adjunct to the standard of care in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). MEDI6012 and ACP501 have the identical amino acid sequence and are therefore considered the same molecular entity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male and female subjects (non-childbearing potential for females) ages 35
             through 80 years at the time of screening who are capable of providing informed
             consent prior to screening and any protocol-related procedures.

          2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (e.g., Health
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA) obtained from the
             subject prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening
             evaluations.

          3. Ability to complete and meet all eligibility requirements for randomization within 28
             days of informed consent (56 days if washing out from lipid altering agent other than
             statins or ezetimibe).

          4. A diagnosis of stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) documented prior to
             screening:

               -  Coronary artery disease defined as a history of prior myocardial infarction,
                  coronary revascularization, history of coronary atherosclerosis based on invasive
                  or non-invasive imaging, and/or abnormal stress testing diagnostic of coronary
                  artery disease.

               -  Carotid artery disease (extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis)
                  defined as evidence of carotid atherosclerosis by carotid imaging, or history of
                  percutaneous or surgical carotid revascularization

               -  Peripheral artery disease defined as ankle-brachial index &lt; 0.90 and
                  claudication, or prior peripheral revascularization for ischemia, or evidence of
                  lower extremity (below the inguinal ligament) atherosclerosis on invasive or
                  noninvasive imaging

          5. Currently receiving statin as standard of care, at a stable dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior
             to screening and intended to remain at a stable dose throughout the study duration.
             Subjects may also be receiving ezetimibe, 10 mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening.

             potential must use condom and spermicide from Day 1 through the end of their
             participation in the study. Because male condom and spermicide is not a highly
             effective contraception method it is strongly recommended that female partners of a
             male study subjects also use a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             this period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             treatment with advanced therapies (cardiac transplant, ventricular assist device,

             valvular heart disease.

             cause and a follicle-stimulating hormone level in the central laboratory's normal
             range for post-menopausal phase is required at screening.

          8. Use of lipid-lowering medications, with the exception of statins and ezetimibe, and
             the following dietary supplements: ≥ 2 grams/day of fish oil (≥ 2 grams/day

             flaxseed, red yeast extract, &gt; 100 mg/day of niacin. At the investigator's discretion,
             subjects may undergo a 6-week washout period of any exclusionary lipid-lowering agents
             with the expectation that post-washout lipid levels will be rechecked and acceptable
