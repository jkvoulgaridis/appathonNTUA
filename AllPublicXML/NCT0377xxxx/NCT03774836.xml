  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the analgesic efficacy of intravenous (IV) tramadol (AVE-901)
      compared to placebo in the management of postoperative pain following abdominal surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (Non-clinical summary) Tramadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic of the
      aminocyclohexanol group with opioid-like effects. Tramadol is extensively metabolized
      following administration, which results in a number of enantiomeric metabolites that display
      different opioid-receptor binding properties, and monoaminergic reuptake inhibition.
