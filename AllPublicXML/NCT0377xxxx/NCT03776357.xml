  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the research study of a rehabilitation tool that informs, guides and empowers
      clinicians to care for their patients. We hope to learn ways to improve patient outcomes,
      reduce costs and increase value to the healthcare system

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator hope to learn co-relation between the rehab tool and clinical findings and
      analyse association if any. Rehab tool will optimize care according to the patient's specific
      needs and provided insights to patients length of stay in the hospital. these data driven
      insights will be used to observe correlation between machine and clinic data
