  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effect of rapid maxillary expansion with
      and without microosteoperforation in patients with skeletal maxillary
      constriction.Theoretically, the force generated by the activation of the Hyrax expander leads
      initially to the compression of the periodontal ligament, bending of the alveolar bone, and
      tipping of the anchor teeth. This in turn contributes to the unfavorable changes in the
      supporting tissues; such as root resorption, buccal crown tipping, reduction of buccal bone
      thickness, marginal bone loss and alveolar bone fenestration and dehiscence. In this trial,
      it is assumed that by reducing the cortical bone resistance, using micro-osteoperforation
      (MOP), the alveolar bone bending and buccal tipping that usually occur during expansion will
      be reduced and thus facilitating the bone expansion.

      The study consists of 2 groups that are divided divided equally and randomly.The first group
      will receive a tooth borne Hyrax expander supported on first premolar and first permanent
      molar , whereas the second group will receive the same appliance associated with
      microosteoperforation(MOP). The MOP will be performed on the buccal segment bilaterally along
      the maxilla starting from the distal of the canine till the distal of the first permanent
      molar. The assessment will be done using CBCT scans immediately after expansion and 6 months
      postretention.
