  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most effective drug in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is
      statins. The protective effects of statin on developement of cardiovascular disease has been
      demonstrated in elderly individuals aged over 75 years. Since side effects of statin are more
      common in elderly individuals than in younger individuals, clinical guidelines recommend that
      use of low intensity statin is considered in elderly individuals. However, there are few
      randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of different intensity statins
      in elderly individuals.

      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial to compare efficacy and safety
      between low and high intensity statin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in
      elderly individuals.

    <textblock>
      Healthy elderly individuals who are eligible to use of statin for primary prevention will be
      enrolled. They are randomly assigned to moderate intensity statin group and low intensity
      statin group by 1:1 manner. Blood tests, physical examinations, and evaluation of statin
      associated muscle symptoms are conducted every 3 months after enrollment. General medical
      care for prevention of cardiovascular disease is continued after 6 months. The accrual period
      is 2 years and follow-up period is 4 years, so the total study period is 6 years.
