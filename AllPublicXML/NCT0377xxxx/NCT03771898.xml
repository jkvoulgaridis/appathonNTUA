  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of intrathecal (IT)
      administration of SHP611 on gross motor function, using the Gross Motor Function
      Classification in Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (GMFC-MLD) compared with matched historical
      control data in children with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).

    <measure>Response in Group A Evaluated Using Gross Motor Function Classification in Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (GMFC-MLD) at Week 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>The response in Group A is defined as maintenance of gross motor function at 2 years (Week 106), evaluated as no greater than 2 levels decline from baseline in GMFC-MLD. The GMFC-MLD is an instrument developed specifically for MLD participants. It is applicable from the age of 18 months onward and can be assessed retrospectively based on medical records. The GMFC-MLD covers clinically relevant gross motor stages occurring in participants with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and consists of 7 levels of walking, sitting, locomotion, trunk and head control. The scoring range is from 0 (walking without support with quality of performance normal for age) to 6 (loss of any locomotion as well as loss of any head and trunk control).</description>

    <measure>Response in Group A Evaluated Using Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)-88 at Week 106</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 106</time_frame>
    <description>The response in Group A gross motor function is defined as maintenance of gross motor function at 2 years (Week 106), defined as a GMFM-88 total score greater than (&gt;) 40. The GMFM-88 is a clinician-evaluated assessment of motor function across 5 dimensions: 1) lying and rolling 2) sitting 3) kneeling and crawling 4) standing and 5) walking, running, and jumping. Scoring is based on the percentage of accomplished tasks within each of the dimensions, and a total score is calculated by averaging each of the dimension scores. Each of the 88 items is rated on a 4-point scale: 0=does not initiate; 1=initiates; 2=partially completes; and 3=completes. GMFM-88 total score range is between 100 percent and 0 percent, with 0 percent corresponding to no mobility.</description>
