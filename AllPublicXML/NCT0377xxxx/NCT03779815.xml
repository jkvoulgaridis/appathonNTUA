        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is over 19 years old and male or female of any race/ethnicity

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma by a hemato-oncology specialist

          -  Subject has undergone clinical, laboratory, or imaging work-up if amyloidosis is
             suspected

          -  Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative does not provide written
             informed consent.

          -  Female subject is pregnant or nursing. Exclusion of the possibility of pregnancy is

             of menses for more than 2 years), 2) woman is surgically sterile (has had a documented
             bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy, or 3) if the woman is of
             childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test performed within 24 hours
             immediately prior to administration of [18F]Florbetaben has to be negative and the
             women is advised to apply contraceptive measures during her participation in this
             study.

          -  Subject has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease
             (which could compromise participation in the study) in the judgment of the
             investigator.

          -  Subject has received any investigational drugs or devices within four weeks prior to
             the study enrollment.

          -  Subject has been previously included in this study.

          -  Subject has any other condition or personal circumstances that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, might make collection of complete data difficult or impossible.

          -  Subject is allergic to Florbetaben or any of ingredients of Florbetaben
