  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythromycin and clindamycin are believed to have anti-inflammatory aspects. This study
      investigates the possible anti-inflammatory effects of erythromycin and clindamycin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Convincing mechanistic reports on the immunomodulatory action of erythromycin and clindamycin
      are scarce, rarely based on experiments in freshly isolated human immune cells, and
      potentially contradicting. Moreover, direct immunomodulatory effects of both antibiotics have
      never been demonstrated in vivo. The Centre for Human Drug Research Biomarker lab has studied
      in depth the immunomodulatory actions of erythromycin and clindamycin in vitro. These in
      vitro experiments on primary human immune cells demonstrated that both erythromycin and
      clindamycin are able to modulate the immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      upon stimulation with different immune triggers such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyI:C.
      In this current study the in vitro work will be translated to an in vivo study where it will
      be made into an intradermal LPS skin challenge model in healthy volunteers.

    <description>2 day pre-treatment with prednisolone daily dose 0.5mg/kg (0.25mg/kg in the morning and 0.25mg/kg in the evening). Prednisolone tablet (0.5mg/kg; parallel comparison): Prednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid with predominant glucocorticoid activity and as such it is widely used in the treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone exerts its effect by binding to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently activates glucocorticoid receptor mediated gene expression. This results in synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins, while inhibiting the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators.</description>

    <description>2 day pre-treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% topical formulation applied twice daily on marked area on left or right side of the volar lower arm.
Clobetasol propionate 0.05% topical formulation (crossover comparison):
Clobetasol propionate is a potent synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Clobetasol propionate exerts its effect by binding to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently activates glucocorticoid receptor mediated gene expression. This results in synthesis of certain anti-inflammatory proteins, while inhibiting the synthesis of certain inflammatory mediators. Specifically, clobetasol propionate appears to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, thereby controlling the release of the inflammatory precursor arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.</description>
