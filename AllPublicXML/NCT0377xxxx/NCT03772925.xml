    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies side effects and best dose of pevonedistat and belinostat in
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has come back
      or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pevonedistat and
      belinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for a regimen
      combining MLN4924 (pevonedistat) with belinostat in patients with refractory/relapsed acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities of this regimen. II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.
      III. If responses are observed, to determine what relationship, if any, exists between such
      responses and TP53/FLT3 mutational status.

      IV. To describe pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions, if any, between MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and
      belinostat.

      V. To test the feasibility of performing correlative studies involving nuclear RelA, p-ATR,
      p-Chk1, Cdt-1, gammaH2A.X, p-BRCA1, p-FANCD2, Ac-H3K56, Ac-H4K16, BCL-2, BIM, BCL-xL, or
      MC-1.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive belinostat intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 30 minutes on days 1-5
      and pevonedistat IV QD over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2
      months for 2 years.

A Chi-square test and a Fisher exact test will be used to determine whether there is a significant association between clinical responses and TP53/FLT3 mutational status. An ordinal regression (where best clinical responses are considered as an ordinal outcome variable) and a logistic regression (where best responses are dichotomized as yes or no responses) will be used to test the association between responses and TP53/FLT3 mutational status, with adjustment of potential factors (e.g., dose level, age, sex, etc.).</description>

          -  The effects of belinostat and/or MLN4924 (pevonedistat) on the developing human fetus
             are unknown. For this reason and because histone deacetylase inhibitors and
             NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitory agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must use 1 highly effective method and 1 additional
             (barrier) method of contraception at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 4 months after the last dose of study drug (female and male
             condoms should not be used together). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and belinostat
             administration

             blood pressure &gt; 95 mm Hg)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% as assessed by echocardiogram or
             radionuclide angiography

          -  Prolongation of the heart-rate corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;= 450 ms (i.e., grade 1 or
             higher) on electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiation of study treatment.

               -  If baseline QTc on screening ECG is &gt;= 450 ms (i.e., grade 1 or higher):

                    -  Check potassium and magnesium serum levels, and

                    -  Correct any identified hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia and repeat ECG to
                       confirm QTc interval

               -  For patients with baseline heart rate &lt; 60 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt; 100 bpm,
                  manual measurement of QT interval by cardiologist is required, with Fridericia
                  correction applied to that manual measurement to determine the QTc for
                  eligibility consideration

                    -  Note: For patients with a heart rate of 60-100 bpm, manual measurement of QT
                       interval and use of the Fridericia formula to determine QTc is NOT required

                       or controlled with device (e.g., pace maker), or ablation

                    -  Patients with paroxysmal a fib or &lt; grade 3 a fib for a period of at least 6
                       months are permitted to enroll provided that their rate is controlled on a
                       stable regimen

                    -  Ventricular rate &lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 120 bpm

          -  Treatment with clinically significant metabolic enzyme inducers within 14 days before
             the first dose of the study drug. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product

          -  Patients should discontinue breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors (e.g.,

          -  Any known UGT1A polymorphism, heterozygous or homozygous

             disease, and pulmonary fibrosis

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following:

               -  In situ cervical cancer,

               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer,

               -  Adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in
                  complete remission, and

               -  Any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 1 year

          -  Medical, psychological, or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the patient's risk, interfere with the patient's participation in the
             study, or hinder evaluation of study results

          -  Pregnant or nursing. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of study therapy.

               -  Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MLN4924 (pevonedistat)
                  is a NEDD8 inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects
                  and because belinostat may cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality by
                  virtue of targeting actively dividing cells. Because there is an unknown but
                  potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment
                  of the mother with MLN4924 (pevonedistat) or belinostat, breastfeeding should be
                  discontinued if the mother is treated with MLN4924 (pevonedistat)/belinostat
