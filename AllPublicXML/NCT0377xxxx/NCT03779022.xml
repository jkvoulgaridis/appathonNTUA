  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of endogenous non-coding RNA. They are responsible for
      post-transcriptional regulation and participate in many vital biological processes.
      Expression profiling has shown that miRNAs can distinguish between normal breast and tumor
      tissues. In recent years, circulating miRNAs have become promising biomarkers based on their
      stability and their non-invasive testing and feasibility in clinical practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current reports showed that serum microRNA expression could be used as an early marker for
      determining the breast cancer risk. The concentrations of some circulating microRNAs in human
      breast cancer have been correlated with tumor development and progression. Aberrant miRNA
      expression may be involved in drug resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents in breast
      cancer. Therefore, we hope to investigate the value of miRNAs in predicting the effect in
      breast cancer neoadjuvant treatment.

      For each patient, 4 mL of peripheral blood will be collected as per predesigned schedule.
      Within 4 hours of blood drawl, samples will be centrifuged at 1500g for 10min at 4℃ to
      separate the plasma supernatant. The plasma and the blood cell will be aliquoted and stored
      at -80℃ until analysis, respectively.
