      The study aims to compare the effect of a lifestyle intervention programme (LIP) using mobile
      application (MetS app) vs using booklet for MetS adults living in the community.

      Methods A multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three arms, namely, MetS app
      group (Group A), booklet group (Group B), and control group (group C). Three hundred and
      sixty subjects will be recruited from six community centers and randomized into either one
      arm. Inclusion criteria are those MetS adult, able to use a smart phone. Group a participants
      will receive a 30-minute educational session and a MetS app while Group B will receive same
      educational session and a MetS booklet and the control group receive a placebo booklet only.
      The MetS app or booklet, has been well developed by the team with the support of internal
      grant, aims to support MetS individual's self- monitoring and record of health measures (body
      weight, blood pressure, waist circumference) and exercise. The primary outcomes of this study
      include the body weight and total physical exercise (GSLTPAQ). The secondary outcomes include
      cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular endurance, self-efficacy for exercise (SEE) and
      stress level (PSS-10). Data will be collected at baseline (T1), 4 week (T2) and week 12 (T3)
      and week 24 (T4). SPSS and Generalized Estimating equations (GEE) model will be employed for
      data analysis.

      Significance This study will provide empirical evidence and inform about the effective way to
      enhance patient's self-management of MetS, exercise sustainability that will be beneficial to
      clients' health.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body weight</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>change in body weight will be measured at the same scale in the follow up centre</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total physical exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total physical exercise will be quantified with a modified version of the GSLTPAQ [31-32]. The patients will be instructed to indicate the amount of exercises undertaken and rank the exercises in the order of difficulty (strenuous, moderate, or mild). The total score will be calculated. This measure has been widely used in empirical studies and shown to exhibit good Psychometric properties [31-32]</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of Self-Efficacy for Exercise (SEE-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SEE-C consists of nine items, and responses are made on a 0-10 scale. The sum of the responses to all nine items yields the final composite score ranging from 0-90. The C-SE has been proved to be reliable with good psychometric properties of Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.75 for Taiwan Chinese older adults [33-34].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular endurance test.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>it is a three -minute step test to test the cardiovascular functional endurance after exercise across the age span and gender. A participant step on and off of a 12 inch high bench / or stair for 3 minutes. Then pulse will be taken afterward while the participant remain standing. Compare the heart rate with the table according to the age and gender to determine the fitness in a range of 7 score from excellent, good, above average, average, below average, poor and very poor . Validity of this test has been established in previous studies. [35] .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress scale (PSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ten self-report items measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful and the current levels of experienced stress in the last month. Summative scores range from 0 to 40, with a higher score indicating higher stress level. These scores have been used as outcome measures of experienced levels of stress. The psychometric properties of the Chinese version of PSS-10 were satisfactory with Cronbach's alphas &gt;0.75 in a local study for Chinese cardiac patients. [36]</description>
