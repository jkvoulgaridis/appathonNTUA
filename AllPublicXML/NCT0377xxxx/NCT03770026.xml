  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective self-controlled clinical study. Women with clomiphene Citrate failure
      with thin endometrium less than 7 millimeters for at least 3 cycles will be selected (N =
      30). Patients will receive 2 ovarian stimulation cycles with Clomiphene citrate (CC) 100 mg/
      day for 5 days from cycle day 3. A control cycle (CC only cycle) woman will continue on CC
      alone plus cervical irrigation of cervix with 1 ml of 0.9% normal saline at cycle day 8 and
      10 to assure patient-blinded method. The study group, the same will be done plus the
      intrauterine infusion of Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in 8th and 10th days of the
      cycle. In both groups, the endometrial thickness and Power Doppler evaluation of their
      endometrial and sub-endometrial blood flow will be measured on the day of Human Chorionic
      Gonadotropin (HCG) administration.

      This is a pilot prospective self-controlled clinical trial. Women with Clomiphene Citrate
      failure with documented thin endometrium less than 7 millimeters for at least 3 stimulation
      cycles will be chosen (N = 30). Patients will experience 2 ovarian stimulation cycles with
      Clomiphene citrate (CC) in a dose of 100 mg/ day for 5 days starting from cycle day 3. A
      control cycle (CC only cycle) woman will continue on Clomiphene Citrate alone plus cervical
      irrigation of cervix with 1 ml of 0.9% normal saline at cycle day 8 and 10 to confirm
      patient-blinded process.

      The study group, the same will be done in addition to the intrauterine infusion of with
      Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in 8th and 10th days of the cycle.

      In both groups, the endometrial thickness and Power Doppler evaluation of their endometrial
      and sub-endometrial blood flow will be measured on the day of HCG administration.
