  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to clinically evaluate peri-implant soft tissue esthetics around
      single delayed implants in the esthetic zone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of soft tissue augmentation on the peri-implant soft tissue esthetics
      along with immediate temporization to immediate temporization only.

      Population (P): patients with a single missing tooth in the esthetic zone Intervention (I):
      Delayed implant placement with immediate temporization and subepithelial connective tissue
      graft Comparator (C): Delayed implant placement with immediate temporization Primary outcome:
      Pink esthetic score (PES) Time frame: 6 months Study design: Randomized controlled clinical
      trial

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pink Esthetic Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post definitive prosthesis</time_frame>
    <description>Pink esthetic score evaluates the soft tissue esthetics around implant supported crowns. Using a 0-1-2 scoring system, 0 being the lowest, 2 being the highest value. The maximum achievable PES is 14. 7 variables are measured: mesial and distal papillae being 0 if absent, 1 if incomplete and 2 if complete. Alveolar process, soft tissue level, contour, texture and color being 0 if major discrepancy, 1 if minor discrepancy and 2 if matches the contralateral</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction by Visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post definitive</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated using a questionnaire which is based on a visual analog scale (VAS). A horizontal VAS bar, 100 mm long, with the right anchor labeled &quot;much less than natural teeth&quot; which is marked by zero and the left anchor labeled &quot;much more&quot; which is marked by 10 will be used. Five questions will be formulated to record the patients' satisfaction in terms of functionality and from an esthetic point of view. Participants will look in a mirror and also be viewed a photograph before recording their answers on the horizontal calibrated line.</description>

             status (e.g., phenytoin, dihydropyridine, calcium antagonists and cyclosporine) within
             1 month before baseline visit;

          3. Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine or once daily aspirin
             (more than 81 mg);

          4. HIV or Hepatitis;

          5. Physical handicaps that would interfere with the ability to perform adequate oral
             hygiene;

          6. Alcoholism or chronic drug abuse;

          7. Heavy smokers (&gt;10/cigarettes per day);

          8. Lack of adequate primary stability at implant insertion that enables immediate
             provisionalization (insertion torque ca 30 Ncm).
