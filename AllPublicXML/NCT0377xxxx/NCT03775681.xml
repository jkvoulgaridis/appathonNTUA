    <textblock>
      This trial determines the feasibility of Laryngeal Mask Airway Gastro (Laryngeal Mask Airway)
      when used on patients who are undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for
      pancreas and bile duct disorders. Laryngeal Mask Airway is a device that helps patients
      breathe while they are asleep during procedures.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the successful completion of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP) with the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Gastro.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine gastroenterologist satisfaction with the LMA Gastro.

      II. To determine anesthesia provider satisfaction with the LMA Gastro.

      III. To determine the rate of unsuccessful LMA Gastro placement.

      IV. To determine the ability of LMA Gastro to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation
      throughout the procedure.

      V. To determine and describe the rate of adverse events.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients wear Laryngeal Mask Airway Gastro after receiving general anesthesia and falling
      asleep. Patients then undergo standard of care endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography. Patients also complete a 5-minute interview following ERCP
      procedure.

    <description>The success rate will be estimated using an exact 95% confidence interval. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all study data. Frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize the failure and success rates. Interval estimation of rates will be provided using Clopper-Pearson exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</description>

    <measure>Gastroenterologist satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surveys for gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist satisfaction with the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Gastro contain items measured on a 10-point Likert scale with 1 reflecting strong disagreement and 10 strong agreement. Mean scores and standard deviations will be used to provide summaries for each survey item. Summaries will be stratified by gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist. Paired differences in survey items between gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist scores will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 95% CIs.</description>
