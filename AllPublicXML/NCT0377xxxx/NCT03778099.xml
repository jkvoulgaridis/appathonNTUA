      Title: The effect of cinnamon supplementation on ovulation induction in women with polycystic
      ovary syndrome, Jeddah 2019: Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-controlled trial

      Phase: III

      Population: 118 women with polycystic ovary syndrome will be recruited from Obstetrics and
      Gynecology clinics in King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Jeddah 2019.

      Subject Participation Duration: Each participant will be followed for three months.

      Intervention: 2g of cinnamon capsules daily will be provided.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

        1. To compare the effectiveness of cinnamon supplement in combination with clomiphene
           citrate versus clomiphene citrate alone on ovulation in women with PCOS, in King
           Abdul-Aziz University Hospital in Jeddah 2019.

        2. To measure the difference in insulin resistance after three months of cinnamon
           supplementation in women with PCOS in King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Jeddah 2019.

        3. To determine the effect of cinnamon and CC on menstrual cyclicity, approximated by
           menstrual frequency, during the study period, in women with PCOS in King Abdul-Aziz
           University Hospital, Jeddah 2019

        4. To evaluate the quality of life in women with PCOS in King Abdul-Aziz University
           Hospital, Jeddah 2019.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To measure the pregnancy rate in women with PCOS in King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital,
           Jeddah 2019

      Description of Study Design:

      The participants will be randomized in 1:1 fashion. Allocation concealment will be ensured
      using similar bottles labeled by letters A and B, to receive either the combination of
      cinnamon supplement and clomiphene citrate or clomiphene citrate with placebo.

      First visit: Patients will be evaluated during the early follicular phase for progesterone
      level and HOMA-IR and QUICK-I. Follow up: 3 months.

      Last Visit: Patients will be re-evaluated to compare the difference.

    <description>The 36 FertiQoL items are rated according to 5 types of response scales.
The response scales are:
Very poor (0), poor (1), neither poor nor good (2), very good (4) Very dissatisfied (0), dissatisfied (1), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied (2), satisfied (3), very satisfied (4) Always (0), very often (1), quite often (2), Seldom (3), never (4) An extreme amount (0), very much (1), a moderate amount (2), a little (3), not at all (4) Completely (0), a great deal (1), moderately (2), not much (3), not at all (4)
Scores on the response scales are reversed, summed and scaled to range from 0 to 100. Higher scores on the subscales and total scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
