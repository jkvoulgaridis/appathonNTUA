  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific studies show that the introduction of digital tools led to: Significant
      improvement in glycemic control, greater patient satisfaction, reduction of emotional burden,
      reduction of fear of hypoglycaemia, reduction of anxiety of the regimen, significantly fewer
      of additional visits to the doctor in addition to those scheduled and a reduction of
      resources.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the MyDose Coach digital tool in patients with T2D
      with basal insulin or candidates for the use of basal insulin.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Evaluate demographic variables and control variables (HbA1c, SMPG, FPG). Measure the units of
      insulin used before and after the intervention

      The maximum study duration will be 29 weeks per patient that will consist of a 12-week
      screening period, a 16-week treatment period, and 1-week follow-up period.

             you will administer the titration safely according to your physician's guidance).
