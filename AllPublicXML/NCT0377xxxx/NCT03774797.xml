  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test and disseminate tools that drive successful immediate
      postpartum Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) implementation. The long-term goal is
      to reduce unintended pregnancy soon after childbirth by increasing access to immediate
      postpartum LARC for women who desire it.

    <textblock>
      Based on previous work, the investigators have generated a toolkit to guide the integration
      of immediate postpartum LARC services into widespread clinical practice. In the proposed
      work, this toolkit will be used to initiate immediate postpartum LARC services in a single
      site with low baseline immediate postpartum LARC uptake (Michigan Medicine). The
      investigators will conduct a feasibility study using mixed methods to assess acceptability
      and appropriateness of toolkit items; patient experience of care; immediate postpartum LARC
      utilization rate; and prenatal contraceptive counseling rate.
