  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that the intervention video - based on strategies from cognitive
      psychology - can correct women's misinformation about long-acting reversible contraception
      (LARC) and result in higher use of LARC. While there are no direct benefits to participants
      from being in the study, the research could benefit women in general by providing evidence to
      help prevent unintended pregnancy. Unlike many interventions that are not feasible for
      scaling up once shown to be effective in changing people's behavior, the proposed
      intervention has been carefully designed to impose a low burden to clinic staff and require
      few resources for translating to wider use. Thus, the investigators expect the intervention
      to have high potential for influencing clinical care and research for addressing the overall
      goal of reducing unintended pregnancy.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial (RT) of consenting adult women (N=220) to
      test the effectiveness of the final intervention video.

      Participants in the RT will complete the &quot;Enrollment Questionnaire&quot; and then will be
      randomized to either watch a short video on 1) debiasing about LARC safety (intervention arm;
      n=110) or 2) vector control (control arm; n=110) (Figure 2). Participants then will have the
      option of receiving routine contraceptive services that follow standard care. After three
      months, trained interviewers will contact participants to administer the short &quot;Follow-up
      Questionnaire&quot; via telephone. To corroborate participant reporting of contraception use
      during follow-up, the investigators also will extract data on LARC use from participant
      medical records.
