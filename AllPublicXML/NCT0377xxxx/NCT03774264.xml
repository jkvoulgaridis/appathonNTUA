      Xiaflex, Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is the only FDA approved medical
      treatment for correcting penile curvature associated with Peyronie's disease. Xiaflex is
      efficacious in approximately 60% of patients with an average improvement in penile curvature
      of 17 degrees as defined by global response assessment.

      Previous analysis indicate that men who were more likely to demonstrate a greater response to
      Xiaflex were those men with: 1) penile curvature 30-60°; 2) disease duration &gt;4 years; 3) no
      plaque calcifications; and 4) IIEF score 1-5 (no sexual activity) and ≥17.

      Current evaluation of Peyronie's Disease at the University of Miami incorporates the use of
      penile duplex ultrasound following administration of intracavernosal vasoactive agent.

      The investigator hypothesize that men with thicker plaques with more shadowing as seen on
      ultrasound imaging. The investigator will test the hypothesis using the following aims:

        -  To identify the prevalence of different types and grades of plaques among men with PD

        -  To identify pre-treatment factors those predict response to Xiaflex, specifically
           ultrasonographic characteristics

      Xiaflex, Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is the only FDA approved medical
      treatment for correcting penile curvature associated with Peyronie's disease.

      Xiaflex is efficacious in approximately 60% of patients with an average improvement in penile
      curvature of 17 degrees as defined by global response assessment. Identifying predictors of
      Xiaflex non-response is extremely important, as the treatment is expensive, time- consuming,
      and may, in some cases be associated with severe adverse effects such as penile pain,
      hematoma and penile fracture. Prospectively identifying men who are likely to benefit from
      CCH therapy would provide significant benefits, in terms of safety, resource allocation, and
      personalized treatment.

      Previous analysis indicate that men who were more likely to demonstrate a greater response to
      Xiaflex were those men with: 1) penile curvature 30-60°; 2) disease duration &gt;4 years; 3) no
      plaque calcifications; and 4) IIEF score 1-5 (no sexual activity) and ≥17.

      Multiple imaging modalities have been evaluated in Peyronie's disease, including ultrasound,
      CT and MRI. Current evaluation of Peyronie's Disease at the University of Miami incorporates
      the use of penile duplex ultrasound following administration of intracavernosal vasoactive
      agent Duplex ultrasound serves two purposes. The first goal of ultrasound is to evaluate
      underlying vasculogenic etiologies in patients with Peyronie's disease and identify any
      co-existent erectile dysfunction. The second goal is to characterize the size and location of
      the plaque.

      Ultrasound has been used to categorize Peyronie's plaques based upon the amount of
      calcification within the plaque: Type 1: The plaque appears as a thickening of the tunica
      albuginea without acoustic shadowing. Type 2: A moderately calcified plaque with a typical
      ultrasound shadow. Type 3: A severely calcified plaque with typical ultrasound shadowing.
      This will be referred to &quot;Pawlowska Type&quot;. A second plaque categorization scheme (plaque
      grading) was proposed by Levine in 2013 that looked at the size of the plaque calcification
      on ultrasound: grade 1 (&lt;0.3 cm), grade 2 (&gt;0.3 cm, &lt;1.5 cm), grade 3 (&gt;1.5 cm; or ≥ 2
      plaques &gt;1.0 cm). This will be referred as &quot;Levine Grade&quot;. In Levine's study, the focus was
      on progression to surgery and never specifically evaluated the use of Xiaflex.

      The investigator hypothesize that men with thicker plaques with more shadowing as seen on
      ultrasound imaging (Pawlowska type 2 and 3) and larger plaques (Levine grade 2 and 3) will
      have less improvements in curvature and PDQ score after Xiaflex treatment. Whereas thinner
      (Pawlowska type 1) and less calcified (Levine grade 1) will have greater improvements in
      curvature (degree and percent) and PDQ score. The investigator will test the hypothesis using
      the following aims:

        -  To identify the prevalence of different types and grades of plaques among men with PD

        -  To identify pre-treatment factors those predict response to Xiaflex, specifically
           ultrasonographic characteristics

    <description>The 15-question International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire is a validated, multi- dimensional, self-administered investigation that has been found useful in the clinical assessment of erectile dysfunction and treatment outcomes in clinical trials. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction.The IIEF-5 score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 items.
22-25: No erectile dysfunction 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction</description>

    <description>Patients will be evaluated in our urology clinic at baseline for possible inclusion in our study. All patients at baseline evaluation will be evaluated for duration of symptoms, relationship stability, IIEF and PDQ. All patients will obtain a penile Doppler ultrasound with the aid of a vasoactive substance by a specially trained technician. During this visit, plaque measurements will be taken: location of plaque, distance of plaque from the tip of the penis, degree of curvature measured by goniometer.
Ultrasound characteristics will be documented: Type (Type 1: The plaque appears as a thickening of the tunica albuginea without acoustic shadowing. Type 2: A moderately calcified plaque with a typical ultrasound shadow. Type 3: A severely calcified plaque with typical ultrasound shadowing) and Grade of calcification (grade 1 (&lt;0.3 cm), grade 2 (&gt;0.3 cm, &lt;1.5 cm), grade 3 (&gt;1.5 cm; or ≥ 2 plaques &gt;1.0 cm).

    <intervention_name>Xiaflex</intervention_name>
    <description>The plaque is injected transversely through the width of the plaque, towards the opposite side of the plaque without passing completely through it. For the second injection in a cycle, the site of injection is made approximately 2 to 3 mm apart from the first injection.
Approximately 24 to 72 hours after the second injection of each treatment cycle subjects will undergo investigator initiated penile plaque modeling. The procedure is repeated 3 times (a total of 4 cycles). Subjects are also advised to gently attempt to straighten the penis without pain during spontaneous erection. The treatment cycle is repeated after 6 weeks for up to 4 treatment cycles. Patients may drop out from the study at any time during the study. .
Post-treatment follow up data is collected at 26 weeks (6 months), 39 weeks (9 months) and 52 weeks (12 months) from baseline evaluation. Post treatment measurements will mirror that of baseline evaluation: symptoms, IIEF, PDQ, degree of curvature, penis length.</description>
