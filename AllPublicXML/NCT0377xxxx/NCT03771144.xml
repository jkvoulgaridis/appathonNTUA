  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POPB is a consequence of the stretching of the nerve roots (C5, C6 + / C7, C8 or T1) of the
      brachial plexus at birth. One third of patients will have sequelae. The most common is the
      appearance of a deficit of passive and active mobilities in the movements in external
      rotation of the shoulder especially in external rotation (RE) elbow to the body, despite
      daily rehabilitation. At present, this stiffness is attributed to an imbalance between the
      external rotator muscles (mainly infraspinatus) that would be atrophied and the internal
      rotator muscles (subscapularis, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi) that would be slightly
      affected In case of no or negative RE from the age of 1 year, there is a surgical indication
      to operate these children. At present, surgery to lift internal retractions is the only
      therapy used, but despite this surgery and intensive rehabilitation, in some patients
      mobility deficits re-occur in a few years. Thus, some teams systematically perform a muscle
      transfer to strengthen the outer rotator muscles deficit during the initial operation. Other
      teams (of which principal investigator is part) do this transfer only secondarily and in some
      patients. Investigators lack objective and scientific criteria for the indication of this
      second muscle transfer surgery and the etiology of retractions is not clearly defined.

      In humans, subscapularis is innervated by the C5 and C6 roots, which are constantly affected
      in POPB. It can be assumed that subscapularis may have an atrophy in POPB patients. To date,
      no anatomopathological study has been performed on the internal / external rotator muscles of
      patients with POPB that can give indications on recurrences.

      Based on our clinical observations and literature data, the main hypothese is there is
      amyotrophy of subscapularis and / or infraspinatus in POPB patients with shoulder stiffness.

    <description>Surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The usual duration of this surgery is on average 1h30. This surgery requires an anterior approach and a posterior approach. The patient is placed in lateral decubitus. The arthroscope of 2.7 is introduced by a posterior route. An anterior instrumental track is made from inside out through the rotator interval.</description>
