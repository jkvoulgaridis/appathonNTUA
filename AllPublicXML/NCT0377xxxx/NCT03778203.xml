      More information is needed on how children fight off influenza virus, as they are at greater
      risk for developing severe influenza infection and tend to have weaker responses to influenza
      vaccination. The purpose of this study is to understand how a child's early exposure to
      influenza vaccine or infection with influenza virus prepares him or her to combat future
      infections with this virus. Investigators will learn about how protection develops following
      an influenza infection or vaccination and the impact this has on future vaccine responses.
      The information learned may allow us to develop better vaccines against influenza virus in
      the future.

    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend yearly influenza vaccination for all children ≥6 months of age;
      however the effect this has on the evolution of the anti-influenza immune response through
      childhood and into adulthood is poorly understood. Though far from idea, yearly vaccination
      is necessary at present due to the ongoing antigenic drift that occurs as viruses continually
      evolve to evade neutralizing antibody. There is currently much interest in the development of
      a universal influenza vaccination that would be able to provide protection against both
      seasonal and potentially pandemic strains of influenza. However, a growing body of evidence
      suggests that early childhood influenza exposures result in imprinting that profoundly shapes
      lifelong CD4 T cell and B cell mediated immunity to this virus. An improved understanding of
      immunity to influenza virus in early childhood is thus needed if a more broadly protective
      approach to influenza vaccination is to be successful.

      There are profound antigenic differences between natural influenza infection, which
      stimulates vigorous inflammation with abundant intracellular antigen, and inactivated
      influenza vaccination, which contains predominately the surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) and
      promotes weak inflammatory signalling. This study will investigate how the context of these
      different routes of early childhood influenza exposure affect the functional potential of the
      anti-influenza immune response and determine the consequences this has on subsequent
      influenza vaccination. This improved knowledge of how early childhood influenza vaccination
      shapes the establishment of anti-influenza immunologic memory will enable both optimization
      of current influenza vaccination strategies and development of novel vaccines able to provide
      highly efficacious universal protection against both seasonal and potentially pandemic
      influenza strains.
