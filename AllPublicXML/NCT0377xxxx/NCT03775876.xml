  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operative shoulder arthroscopy under regional block anesthesia often presents with
      hemodynamic challenges for the anesthesiologist, knowing that a low systolic blood pressure
      is required to minimize the bleeding. Regional anesthesia is successfully performed to many
      patients in whom tracheal intubation or the placement of a laryngeal tube is undesired.
      Propofol has traditionally been used to provide sedation in patients undergoing shoulder
      arthroscopy under regional anesthesia. In contrast to Propofol, Dexmedetomidine is a highly
      selective Î±-2 adrenoceptor agonist that has been shown to provide sedation, analgesia and
      anxiolytic effects with minimal respiratory depression. Due to the effect of both drugs on
      blood pressure, the investigators set out to compare intraoperative hemodynamics of both
      drugs, along with the surgeon's satisfaction and the degree of comfort provided to patients
      undergoing interscalene brachial plexus block for shoulder arthroscopy. The investigators
      also assessed whether the type of anesthetic agent used for sedation accounted for other
      differences in intra and post-operative outcome measures.
