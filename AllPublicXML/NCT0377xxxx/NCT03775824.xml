      This study evaluates the intestinal microbiome and disease activity in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Patients will be analysed at two
      time points in reference to two predefined primary endpoints:

        -  Changes in intestinal microbiome

        -  Response to therapy

      The investigators want to evaluate if successful treatment of rheumatoid arthritis coincide
      with specific changes in the gut flora.

    <textblock>
      Methotrexate (MTX) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -inhibitors are two efficient medications
      for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In a substantial number of cases however, these
      medications remain ineffective. At present, the scientific community has limited
      understanding of why some patients are resistant to these medications. The purpose of this
      study is to understand if the gut flora may associate with treatment response.

      Recent studies have associated rheumatoid arthritis with intestinal dysbiosis. Specifically,
      the bacteria Prevotella copri, has been associated with this disease, an observation that has
      been supported also by mechanistic studies. In patients receiving methotrexate, normalization
      of dysbiosis has been associated with successful treatment.

      This study is of observational character and integrated in the routine clinical care of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis at the Rheumatology Clinic, Skane University Hospital,
      Lund, Sweden. Study participants are asked to deliver blood and fecal sampling at two
      time-points together with clinical evaluation of disease activity. With an estimated
      inclusion of 50 patients, at least 20 responders and 20 non-responders are expected to be
      included and to be compared to each other.

      If successful treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis is associated with specific
      alterations of the gut flora, these results may guide future studies on the impact of
      dysbiosis and probiotics on this disease.

        This study encompasses consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis who by their
        physician at the Rheumatology Clinic, Skåne University Hospital, have been prescribed any
        of the predefined drugs.
