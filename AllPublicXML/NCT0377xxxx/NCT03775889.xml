  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on several years of working with Navajo communities to increase gardening
      and healthy eating. In collaboration with the Dream Din√© Charter School in Shiprock, NM, the
      investigators propose to develop a school garden intervention to increase fruit and vegetable
      consumption and reduce risk for obesity among Navajo families. The intervention will
      integrate: an enhanced school garden plot; a curriculum for elementary school children on
      gardening and healthy eating; and family engagement in the curriculum and at community
      gardening fairs.
