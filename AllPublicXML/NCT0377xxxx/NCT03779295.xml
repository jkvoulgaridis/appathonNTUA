  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioral dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin around the mouth. The cause of perioral
      dermatitis is unknown. Current treatment methods include oral antibiotics and topical
      calcenurin inhibitors, both of which produce side effects and have been relatively
      ineffective in the treatment of perioral dermatitis. The investigators hope to assess the
      efficacy of laser therapy in treatment of perioral dermatitis by using laser therapy on one
      half of the patients face and having patients apply topical medication (clindamycin) to their
      face for 8 weeks. The side of their face that receives laser therapy will be randomized. The
      investigators will assess the efficacy of laser therapy by counting the number of lesions
      that patients have before and after laser therapy, comparing photos of patient's perioral
      dermatitis before and after treatment, and having patient's rate their satisfaction of the
      treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a split face prospective trial. The face will be treated in halves. The halves will be randomized to receive topical clindamycin or PDL therapy and clindamycin. Both halves of the face will be treated with topical clindamycin. Per randomization, half of the face will be treated with pulse dye laser therapy at 595 nm, using 6.5 J/cm2, 10 mm spot size and a 6 millisecond pulse width.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The investigators will not remind the participant or other investigators which side of the face received laser therapy, however the investigators cannot completely &quot;blind&quot; either the participant or other investigators as they will be awake or performing the therapy, respectively.</masking_description>
