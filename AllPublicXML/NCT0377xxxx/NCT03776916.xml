  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to comparing the different simethicone administration
      strategies for esophagogastroscopy. Recent studies have indicated that the administration of
      simethicone before endoscopic examination could shorten the procedure time and improve the
      diagnostic rate of the gastric mucosal lesions. But the time interval between simethicone
      administration and the examination has not been fully determined. This study will test
      whether the time of taking simethicone before endoscopy could influence the performance of
      the procedure in a randomized controlled trial. The results may benefit the current clinical
      practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophagogastroscopy can enable the direct examination of the esophageal and gastric mucosal
      lesions, which has been widely applied in clinical practice. However, during the examination,
      too much water, foam or residues in the stomach will not only increase the procedure time and
      the misdiagnosis rate, but also decrease the patients' tolerance, for more efforts should be
      made to deal with the excessive water, foam or residues in order to obtain a clear view of
      the mucosa. Simethicone is also called poly-dimethylsiloxane, which can be used to remove the
      foam and water. Although simethicone has been routinely administrated before the
      esophagogastroscopy, the optimal strategy of administrating simethicone has not been clearly
      investigated, especially the time to administrate simethicone. Intaking simethicone too early
      will result in too excessive water in the stomach, while if the patients take it too late it
      doesn't take effects. Thus, this is a study to determine whether selecting different
      simethicone administration strategies could improve the performance of the
      esophagogastroscopy and minimize the patients' dissatisfaction.

    <description>A 10-point scale was used to evaluate the patients' satisfaction (0 worst, 10 best). All the symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension and the like were all recorded.
It is anticipated that the use of simethicone will significantly improve patients' satisfaction.</description>
