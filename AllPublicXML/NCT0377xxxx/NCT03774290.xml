    <textblock>
      The present trial is an exploratory study aiming at evaluating the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of a 15-day, once daily administration of 10 mg PBF-680 in subjects with persistent,
      mild-to-moderate atopic asthma.

      Purpose and rationale: Extracellular adenosine, produced from dephosphorylation of adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine monophasphate (AMP), is an important signaling molecule in
      asthma, involved in bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. PBF-680 is an A1 adenosine
      receptor antagonist that has successfully completed single dose escalation and
      treatment-period phase-I trials in healthy volunteers, plus a crossover, proof-of-concept
      Phase-IIa trial in mild and moderate asthmatics, where a single dose significantly attenuated
      airway hyperresponsiveness to AMP challenge and increased 8-hour post-challenge FEV1. In
      terms of exploratory efficacy, the primary purpose of this study is to determine whether
      PBF-680 compared to placebo, improves the FEV1, as well as to provide comparative safety data
      from this population of asthmatics. Measurements made in this study will also be used to
      establish whether this treatment improves other variables related to asthma control and lung
      function.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to demonstrate an improvement in trough FEV1 upon a
      15-day treatment with PBF-680 compared to placebo in mild-to-moderate asthmatics that, on
      study entry, are managed in Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) therapeutic steps 2-3.
      Secondary objectives include determinations of FEV1 area under the curve (AUC), evaluations
      on pre- and post- bronchodilator FEV1, and patient reported outcomes (PROs) including Asthma
      Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) and Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire
      (AQLQ(S)).

      Study design and population: this is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
      controlled trial with a 2-arm parallel design. The treatments studied are once-daily PBF- 680
      10 mg and placebo, as two orally administered, 5-mg PBF-680 capsules or two placebo capsules,
      respectively. The study comprises: (i) a minimum of 5-days screening period, during which,
      the subject's clinical stability and overall eligibility for the study will be assessed; (ii)
      a weaning phase where a stepwise tapering of the asthma medication will be done upon 7-day
      periods; (iii) the randomized, parallel-arm treatment period; and (iv) an end-of-study
      follow-up visit. The asthma medication weaning period comprises three possible visit pathways
      in order to adjust for each subject's asthma therapy on study entry. The study will comprise
      a primary analysis population of 58 stable asthmatic subjects managed as described for the
      objectives, who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria and complete a full,
      valid data set for the primary variable. The total recruitment estimates to meet this target
      is 78 subjects.

    <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7) comprises 5 patient-reported symptoms that are scored from 0 to 6.The points are added and divided by 5. According to the result:
Less than or equal to 0.75: Adequate control of asthma From 0.75 to 1.50: partially controlled asthma More than 1.50: Inadequate control of asthma. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire AQLQ(S) scores symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental exposure through 32 questions. The overall AQLQ score is the mean of the responses to each-of the 32 questions on a 7- point scale (7=no impairment, 1 =severe impairment)</description>

             the asthma symptoms during the trial.

          -  A respiratory tract infection requiring the use of antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to
             visit V1, or pneumonia within 6 months prior to visit V1.

             managed exacerbations using an &quot;action plan&quot;.

          -  Subjects with any other underlying diseases that may compromise safety or may
             interfere with eﬃcacy outcomes (e.g. tuberculosis, clinically relevant bronchiectasis,

             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject
             in case of participation in the study. The investigator must determine this in
             consideration of the subject's medical history and/or clinical or laboratory evidence
             of the following conditions, including but not limited to: inﬂammatory bowel disease;
             digestive tract ulcers; gastrointestinal or rectal bleeding; major gastrointestinal
             tract surgery such as gastrectomy or bowel resection; pancreatic injury or
             pancreatitis; liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function.
