  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the amount of study drug that gets into
      your blood after the administration of each of the three formulations of cetirizine under
      different conditions. Another objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on
      the amount of study drug that gets into your blood after the administration of the
      investigational formulation. Other objectives of this study are to determine the sensory
      experience and ease of swallowing the investigational formulation, as well as to determine
      the safety of test and reference formulations of cetirizine.

      The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of a cetirizine 10 mg chewable
      tablet manufactured at Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Inc. (McNeil LLC) with two commercially
      marketed cetirizine 10 mg immediate release (IR) tablets (ZYRTEC®, US reference) and
      (Australian/EU reference), establish bioequivalence between the two commercial products
      (ZYRTEC®, US reference and REACTINE®, Australian/EU reference), and to evaluate the effect of
      food on bioavailability of the cetirizine 10 mg chewable tablet compared to the
      bioavailability of cetirizine 10 mg chewable tablet administrated with water only. In
      addition, subject's sensory experience and ease of swallowing of the test product will be
      assessed.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, single-dose, four-treatment crossover bioequivalence and food effect study of Cetirizine Chewable Tablets versus ZYRTEC® Immediate Release (IR) Tablets (US reference) and REACTINE® IR Tablets (EU and Australian marketed reference product).
The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will have a randomized, four way crossover study design in which 40 healthy subjects, ages 18 to 55 years, will be randomized to four sequences of Treatments A, B, D and E over consecutive periods. No less than approximately 40% of either gender will be represented in the study population. Part 2 of the study will assess a potential food effect in which all subjects will be administered Treatment C in the fifth period.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding of the test and reference products to study subjects is not feasible, because the products are different dosage forms (chewable tablets and IR tablets) and administered in different ways (with or without water and fasted or fed). Personnel conducting the bioanalyses of samples will not know the treatment sequence. The randomization code will not be available to them until the analytical tables have been finalized and audited by the Algorithme Pharma (An Altasciences Company) Quality Assurance (QA) department.</masking_description>

             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of prescription or non-prescription medications within 5 half-lives before the

             study drug.

         10. Preplanned surgical procedures during the study period as this may interfere with the
             conduct of the study.

         11. History of alcoholism or substance abuse, as judged by the Investigator, within the
             past 6 months preceding this study.

             estimated lost blood volume equaled or exceeded 50 mL.

         16. Donation or loss of blood within 56 days prior to the first treatment visit if the
             estimated lost blood volume equaled or exceeded 500 mL.

         17. Has any acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition(s) that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or IP administration or may interfere with
             the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the medically qualified
             Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

         18. Relationship to persons involved directly in the conduct of the study (i.e., principal
             Investigator, sub-Investigators, study coordinators, other study personnel, employees
             or contractors of the sponsor or Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiaries, and the family of
             each).

         19. Has any clinically important abnormal value for serum chemistry, hematology, or
             urinalysis at screening. Laboratory values will generally be within the normal ranges,
             although minor deviations in tests (except those explicitly specified in the inclusion
             criteria) that are not considered clinically important by the Investigator are
             acceptable.

         20. Has a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2 antibodies,
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV).
