      The trial is an open-label, 2-period, randomised, crossover study of the plasma
      concentrations of aramchol, in which subjects will receive oral doses of aramchol at 300 mg
      twice daily (every 12 h) for 9 days in one period, with a single dose in the morning of Day
      10, and 600 mg once daily (every 24 h) for 10 days in the other period. A pharmacokinetic
      profile will be obtained over the dosing interval on Day 10 of each period.

      Enrolment of 16 subjects is planned with each subject taking part in the 2 study periods. The
      subjects will be randomised 1:1 so that 8 subjects receive each regimen in the first period
      and the alternate regimen in the second period.

      Subjects will be screened within 21 days before their first dose of study medicine. In each
      period they will remain resident on the ward from Day -1 until the morning of Day 11.
      Subjects will attend a follow-up visit 14 days (Â±2 days) after the end of the second period.
      There will be an interval of at least 7 days between Periods 1 and 2.

             values that are within 5 mm Hg for blood pressure or 5 beats/min for heart rate) will
             be repeated. Subjects can be included if the repeat value is within range or still
             borderline, but deemed not clinically significant by the investigator.

         16. Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

         17. Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing.
