    <textblock>
      The study uses a mixed method study to evaluate wether the use of the indicators of the
      Quality of end-of-life cancer care, developed by Earle et al [Earle JCO 2003; DOI:
      10.1200/JCO.2003.03.059] would be relevant and measurable in France. The qualitative part of
      study was designed to investigate the representations of quality by face-to face interviews
      with family carer of recently deceased cancer patients, and with their oncologists, and
      nurses. The quantitative part of the study, consisted in a decedents case series analysis,
      diagnosed with advanced cancer and followed up in 5 centers. Data on trajectory of care were
      collected from different complementary sources associating national mortality data, hospital
      activity data, and health records.

      The study was approved by the French data protection authority (CNIL) number 611273.
