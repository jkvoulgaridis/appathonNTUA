  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center Ib / II study of triple targeted drug combination (aromatase
      inhibitor letrozole，novel HER2-targeted small molecule inhibitor pyrotinib and CDK4/6
      inhibitor SHR6390) as a first or second line of therapy in patients with relapsed/metastatic
      hormone receptor positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.

      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study
      of letrozole in combination with novel human epidermal growth factor
      receptor-2(HER2)-targeted tyrosine kinase Inhibitor pyrotinib and cyclin-dependent kinase
      4/6(CDK4/6) Inhibitor SHR6390 in subjects with hormone receptor(HR)+/HER2+ relapsed or
      metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll natural postmenopausal women, or women who
      have undergone bilateral oophorectomy.The phase Ib part of the study will determine safety
      and tolerability of the combination of letrozole, pyrotinib and SHR6390 to define that
      appropriate dose of SHR6390 for phase II.The dose of letrozole and pyrotinib will be constant
      through the study period. Once the recommended regimen has been identified, subjects with the
      selected tumor type will be enrolled into expansion cohorts for the purpose of assessing
      efficacy and safety of the combination treatment.
