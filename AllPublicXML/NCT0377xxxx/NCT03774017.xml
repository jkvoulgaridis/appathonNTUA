  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) in ≥3 Spetzler-Martin grades have long been
      challenges among cerebrovascular diseases. None of the traditional methods, such as
      microsurgical operation, endovascular intervention, or stereotactic radiotherapy, can
      completely eliminate complex bAVMs without a risk of neural function deterioration. The
      multistaged hybrid operation solved part of the challenge but remained risky in the
      installment procedures and intervals. The one-staged hybrid operation was applied in the
      surgical treatment of cerebrovascular diseases and proved to be a potentially safe and
      effective method for curing complex bAVMs. However, lacking the support of high-level
      evidence, its advantages remain unclear. This study was proposed to validate the benefits and
      risks of one-staged hybrid operation in the treatment of complex bAVMs, as well as its
      indications, key technologies, and workflows.

      The study is being conducted from Jan 2016 to Dec 2020 with 20 cooperation units. It consists
      of 2 sets. The registry set is designed as a prospective real-world registry. The trial set
      is designed as a prospective pragmatic clinical trial, specifically for the patients with
      perforating arterial feeders. The two sets share a common grouping: the traditional operation
      group and the one-staged hybrid operation group. The assignment is based on the clinical
      condition in the registry set and is randomized in the trial set. End points will be
      evaluated at scheduled time points. The safety and efficiency of one-staged hybrid operation
      in treating complex bAVMs will be validated.
