  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well umbralisib and pembrolizumab work in treating patients
      with classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to
      treatment (refractory). Umbralisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving umbralisib and pembrolizumab may work
      better in treating classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 for up to 16 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive umbralisib
      orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, then up to 1 year.

             therapy, hormonal therapy, surgery and/or tumor embolization, prednisone &gt; 10 mg or
             equivalent) or any investigational drug within 21 days of cycle 1 day 1. Patients
             receiving radiation therapy within 14 days from cycle 1 day 1. Anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1
             therapy in patients with less than a CR after 18 weeks of such therapy is permitted to
             continue on schedule

             (hepatitis C virus [HCV]), active cytomegalovirus (CMV), or known history of human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV). If hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody, HCV antibody or CMV
             immunoglobulin (Ig)M is positive, the patient should be evaluated for the presence of
             HBV, HCV or CMV by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) to

               -  Concomitant use of medication known to cause QT prolongation or torsades de
                  pointes. Poorly controlled or clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular
                  disease including cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack

             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, breast or cervical cancer in situ, or

             unless approved by the protocol principal investigator

             hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP] or vitiligo)
