  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REACT is a randomized intervention to examine the benefits of African Dance as a method to
      increase physical activity behaviors in older adults. In this 6- month intervention, older
      African Americans will be randomly assigned to either an African Dance or an Africana Culture
      class. Both before and at the completion of the intervention, the investigators will collect
      a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and MRI scans of brain health and function to
      better study how physical activity influences neurocognitive health in African Americans.

      Aim 1: Examine whether the African Dance intervention improves cognitive performance compared
      to an educational control group. H1: The dance group will show cognitive improvements in a
      domain-specific fashion such that executive and memory functions will be enhanced more than
      other cognitive domains; Aim 2. Examine whether African Dance influences brain morphology,
      task-evoked neural responses, cerebral blood flow, and resting state connectivity. H1: It is
      predicted that African Dance will increase volume, white matter integrity, perfusion, and
      functional activation/connectivity in a regionally-specific fashion such that prefrontal and
      hippocampal areas will be more sensitive to the intervention than other brain regions. Aim 3.
      Explore potential physiological and socio-emotional mechanisms of the dance intervention. The
      investigators will collect measures of physical and psychosocial health such as waist
      circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, mood, anxiety, depression, and
      loneliness and examine whether intervention-related changes to these measures mediate
      improvements in cognitive performance.

    <intervention_model_description>180 African American older adults between the ages of 60-80 will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: African Dance or Africana Culture. Both groups will meet 3 times per week for 1 hour over a period of 6-months. Cognitive and brain metrics will be assessed at baseline and following the completion of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Basic Science</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Neither the investigator, nor outcomes assessors will know participants' group assignments. Participants will be instructed to refrain from speaking about their group's activities when visiting the lab for follow-up assessment. In addition, special care was taken to ensure that non-blinded laboratory staff (e.g., staff member notifying participants of their group assignments, staff monitoring the intervention classes) are not located in the same proximity in the laboratory, further preventing accidental unblinding.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A Color-Word Stroop will be administered at baseline, and then following the intervention (6-months). The main outcome from this task is the Stroop effect (in ms). A higher Stroop effect indicates worse executive functioning. Group differences will be tested on this outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flanker Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A Flanker task will be administered at baseline, and then following the intervention (6-months). The main outcome from this task an interference effect (in ms) which indicates how much longer it takes for a participant to make a directional response to a center arrow when the flanking arrows are arranged in congruent vs. incongruent direction from the center stimulus. A higher interference effect indicates worse executive functioning. Group differences will be tested on this outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hippocampal volume (mm3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Structural scans will be collected at baseline as well as following the intervention. Hippocampal volume will be calculated in mm3. The investigators will examine group differences in size of the hippocampus following the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiorespiratory fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will conduct a sub-maximal fitness test before and after the intervention in order to calculate each participant's fitness level (via estimated V02 max). The investigators will examine group differences in fitness following the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy steps per day</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will collect objective physical activity levels via wrist-worn accelerometers every 6 weeks throughout the intervention. Steps per day will be a primary outcome from the actigraphy. The investigators will examine changes in physical activity over the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be weighed on a calibrated stadiometer both before and after the intervention. The investigators will examine percent changes in body weight in the groups before and after the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are collecting a questionnaire measuring self-perceived loneliness, the University of California Loneliness Scale (UCLALS). This is a 20-item scale in which participants rate frequency of feelings of loneliness and social isolation on a 4 point scale ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;often&quot;. A total score is computed which can range from 20- 80. Higher scores indicate more loneliness. The questionnaire will be assessed at baseline as well as at the 6-month followup.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are collecting a questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a 20-item measure that asks caregivers to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. The questionnaire will be administered at baseline as well as at the 6-month followup.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete an N-back task while in the scanner. Task-evoked activation will be the primary outcome. The investigators will examine whether the pattern of task activation changes following the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>resting state functional connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine changes in resting state functional connectivity using a region-of-interest-based approach centered on the hippocampus. The investigators will examine whether the strength of connectivity (z) of the hippocampus changes following the intervention.</description>

    <description>Basic principles and guidelines for exercise programming will be followed including adequate warm-up and cool-down, progressive and gradual increments in duration, and instruction regarding avoidance of physical activity (PA) related injury. The African dance group will receive moderate intensity dance 1 hour per day, twice per week, for 6 months. The prescribed intensity will begin at light to moderate and progress to a moderate to high intensity level. Frequent assessment of heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion will ensure appropriate levels of intensity during each dance session. Levels of exertion during the dance will be prescribed and monitored based on baseline assessments of heart rate and cardiorespiratory fitness.</description>
