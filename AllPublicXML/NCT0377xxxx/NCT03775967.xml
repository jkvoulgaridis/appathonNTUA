  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sialic acid (SA) is the generic term given to a family of acetylated derivatives of
      neuraminic acid. SA is a 9 carbon monosaccharide. An important function of host SA is to
      regulate innate immunity. SA is present in several acute phase proteins which are known to be
      associated with periodontitis. There exists a need for a biomarker, for early detection of
      disease evolution and more robust therapy efficacy measurements. Till date, there is very
      little data regarding simultaneous estimation and comparison of total SA content in saliva.
      IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, regulates the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      such as IL-1, -2, -6 and stimulates protective antibody production. IL-10 is expressed in
      both healthy and diseased human periodontal tissues and is reported to be reduced in patients
      infected with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.

      The present study was therefore undertaken with an aim, to not only assess the levels of
      TSA(Total sialic acid levels),but also of IL 10 levels in saliva from stage 1(mild) to stage
      2(moderate) periodontitis patients

      Selection of patients by grading the patients according to criteria stage 1 and 2
      Periodontitis

      Obtaining consent from patients participating in the study

      Collection of saliva-unstimulated whole saliva, the samples will be stored at -20 degree
      Centigrade and later placed in a 1.5ml centrifuge tubes which will be placed in a vacuum cool
      box indicated for laboratory samples and transported to the lab for investigations. It will
      be centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 mins,stored at -80 deg C. SA(sialic acid) levels will be
      determined by thiobarbutic acid method of aminoff and ELISA methods. SA levels will be
      measured in mg/dl,IL10 as in direct measurement.
