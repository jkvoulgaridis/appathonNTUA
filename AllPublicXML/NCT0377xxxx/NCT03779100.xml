    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on mRECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions.</description>
