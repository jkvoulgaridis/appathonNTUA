  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involves adapting 3 new intervention components, and then testing them, in
      combination with a multi-level, community-based intervention, to promote HIV prevention and
      sexual health among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Lima, Peru. The total
      intervention has a community-based intervention and a systems-level intervention at the
      hospital where people living with HIV get care and medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mpowerment (MP) is an evidence-based community-level, structural, social and behavioral
      intervention for HIV prevention for young men who have sex with men (MSM). MP targets
      individual and community empowerment and community mobilization, self-affirmation, sexual
      self-knowledge and creation of a supportive and affirming social environment. MP has been
      widely used in the U.S. but not in Peru, with the exception of earlier pilot research. In the
      earlier research, MP was adapted for the sociocultural issues facing MSM and transgender
      (trans) women in Peru, and only focused risk reduction and increasing HIV testing. In
      addition to the MP (which is called the community-based intervention), a health systems
      component has been added. The health systems includes (1) sensitization of hospital staff
      (where people living with HIV obtain their medication) to the issues facing transgender women
      and MSM; (2) the use of Navigators, who help MSM and trans women at the hospital navigate the
      system of care and remain in care; and (3) a focus on &quot;positive prevention&quot;, in which
      providers talk about the positive aspects of maintaining in care and being virally suppressed
      instead of only talking about &quot;avoiding death.&quot; There is a 2.5 year implementation of the
      intervention, called &quot;Projecto Orgullo Plus&quot; or Project Pride Plus, which involves a
      longitudinal cohort of MSM/trans in two large districts of Lima, Peru. Primary outcomes will
      be unprotected anal sex and HIV testing. Secondary outcomes will be self-reported visits to
      hospital for care and adherence to medications.

    <description>Generacion Actual includes Community-based and a Health Systems Components. This multi-level intervention reaches out to all MSM/trans by mobilizing them to encourage friends to reduce risk behavior and increase HIV testing, and for HIV+ friends, encourage them to link, stay in care, and take medications regularly. The community based component includes a leadership group, community space, community mobilization events, and group sessions to address a variety of psychosocial issues as well as HIV literacy. The Health Systems component includes sensitization of the HIV testing and care staff to working with MSM and trans, Navigators to help MSM/trans to navigate the complex health system; and positive prevention training of providers; all evidence-based approaches.</description>
