      To evaluate the efficacy of water bath, water + bleach, and water + vinegar (acetic acid) in
      the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To perform a randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of adding dilute acetic
      acid to the bath twice weekly on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score as compared
      to adding dilute bleach to the bath including a control arm in which no solution is added to
      the bath.

    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score improvement from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score is a validated composite score that ranges from 0 (clear) to 72 (very severe). The EASI is assessed and calculated as: the proportion of affected body surface area (BSA) was estimated from 4 designated body regions (head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs), and the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs was determined for each region. The Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs grades signs of AD (erythema, edema/induration/papulation, excoriation, oozing/weeping/crusting, scaling, and lichenification) on a 4-point scale, ranging from absent to severe. Both the proportion of affected BSA and the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs score are used to calculate the EASI score.</description>

    <measure>Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)</measure>
    <time_frame>At each visit until the last visit at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The POEM measures the severity of eczema from a scale of 0-28 with 0 being clear and 28 as having severe eczema.
0 to 2 = Clear or almost clear
3 to 7 = Mild eczema
8 to 16 = Moderate eczema
17 to 24 = Severe eczema
25 to 28 = Very severe eczema</description>

    <description>This quality of life (QoL) measures the patient quality of life from 0 - 30 with 0 being the patient's eczema doesn't have an affect on the patient's QoL while 30 means it has a profound effect on the patient's QoL.</description>

    <description>This quality of life (QoL) measures the patient quality of life from 0 - 30 with 0 being the patient's eczema doesn't have an affect on the patient's QoL while 30 means it has a profound effect on the patient's QoL.</description>
