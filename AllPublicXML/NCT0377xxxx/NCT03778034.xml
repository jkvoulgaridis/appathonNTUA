  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forward head posture and temporomandibular disorder are two common problems in post-pubertal
      females. They are closely related to each other. Previous studies showed influences of head
      posture on the mandibular rest position, range of functional movements and the jaw and neck
      muscles work together during rhythmic movements. They affirm that patients with TMD present
      more alterations in head positioning than patients with no dysfunction .

      However, no studies up to date has been evaluated the effect of FHP on TMJ proprioception.
      The proprioceptors in the human TMJ play important key role in identification of mandibular
      position when the teeth are not occluded. TMJ receptors provide the greater afferent activity
      regarding perceptual awareness of joint position and movement . Proper assessment of TMJ
      proprioception may be critical for designing not only rehabilitation but also
      pre-habilitation interventions for patients with FHP aiming to prevent TMD. Therefore, this
      study will be the first one which aims to investigate the effect of FHP on TMJ proprioception
      in post-pubertal females. This study may expand the role of physiotherapy in woman's health.

    <measure>Testing TMJ proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>TMJ proprioception will be tested through a digital vernier caliper for each female in both groups. Each female will be asked to sit on a stool, feet will be rested on the floor, arms will be supported on armrests, knees and elbow joints will assume right angles, and the chair's back will not exceed suprascapular border. With closed eyes, the female's mouth will be opened passively by 3 cm measured by adigital Vernier caliper, which is considered as functional position of jaw for eating and speech. The procedures will be repeated 3 times and maintained for 3 seconds. Then, each female will be asked to open her mouth actively for the target distance and the distance will bemeasured by the caliper.</description>

    <description>The angle formed at the intersection of the line between the midpoint of the humerus and spinous process of C7 and the horizontal line through the midpoint of the humerus. The investigators considered 52Â° as the reference angle and will be measure like CVA</description>

    <gender_description>Forward head posture and temporomandibular disorder are two common problems in post-pubertal females.Females exhibit more incidence of FHP after puberty than males. This posture of greater flexion in females can be attributable to psychosocial issues, such as stress, or partly associated with the development of secondary sex characteristics in females.Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common pain conditions that have the highest prevalence among females of reproductive age.the male to female ratio of TMD patients is estimated at around 1:3 and The pattern of onset after puberty and lowered prevalence rates in the postmenopausal years suggest that female reproductive hormones may play an etiologic role in TMD</gender_description>
