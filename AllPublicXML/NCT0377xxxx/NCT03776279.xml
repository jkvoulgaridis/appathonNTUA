  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in Relapsed or refractory peripheral t-cell
      and NK/T-cell lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      The dosage regimen of Liposome-entrapped Mitoxantrone is multi-cycle 20mg/m2 intravenous
      infusion. Every 4 weeks is a treatment cycle, with administration on the first day of each
      cycle. End-of-treatment visit will be made to the subjects within 4 weeks after the end of
      the last administration. Progression-free survival (PFS) follow-up will be conducted to the
      subjects in stable or improved condition after treatment and the subjects with early
      termination of treatment due to intolerance in Week 8 after the last administration of study
      drug, and thereafter once every 8 weeks until PD, death, withdrawal of informed consent form
      (ICF), starting another new treatment or end of the entire study (whichever occurs first).
      Meanwhile, overall survival (OS) follow-up will also be conducted to the subjects with PD and
      starting another new treatment once every 8 weeks until death, withdrawal of ICF or end of
      the entire study (whichever occurs first).
