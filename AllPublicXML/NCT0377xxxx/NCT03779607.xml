  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      evaluation of color difference between zirconia reinforced lithium silicate (celtra press) VS
      lithium disilicate (Emax) in relation to natural tooth structure to determine which
      monolithic material will provide restoration with exact shade and optical properties as
      natural tooth structure.

      eligible patients will be randomized in 2 equal group between study group (celtra press) and
      control group (Emax) .

      Single tooth in esthetic zone requiring full coverage crown is prepared to receive an all
      ceramic crown of .

      Grouping: The crowns will be divided into two groups:

      I:Teeth receiving crowns fabricated from IPS emax press ( ivoclarvivadent) II:Teeth receiving
      crowns fabricatedfrom Celtrapress(dentsplysirona).

      Shade will be measured using intraoral spectrophotometer and evaluated.

      The color difference (ΔE ) will be calculated for each sample using the following equation:
      ΔE =[(ΔL*)²+(Δa*)² + (Δb*)²]½

      ΔE (perceptibility threshold ) will be evaluated for each group.

    <description>Lithium disilicate reinforced glass ceramics are available in the market in two forms according to the technique of manufacturing, either heat pressed ingots or CAD/CAM blocks for milling. The heat pressed lithium disilicate glass ceramic consists of approximately 70% lithium disilicatecrystals(the main crystal phase) having a needle like shape that are embedded in a glassy matrix. The crystals length is about 3 to 6 μm. The heat pressed ingots are fully crystallized and the restoration is fabricated by the lost wax technique where the lithium disilicate ingots are pressed into the investment mold at high temperature. The pressed lithium disilicate has strong flexural strength values(range 400 ± 40 MPa)</description>

    <description>new class of zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate material available to labs for pressing. This unique material provides top aesthetics and is virtually impossible to tell apart from a natural tooth.
Celtra Press is a multiphase ceramic consisting of a glass matrix and lithium disilicate crystals having a crystal length of about 1.5 µm plus nano-scale lithium phosphate . In addition to Li2O and SiO2, Celtra Press contains about 10% zirconia (ZrO2), which is dissolved completely in the glass phase rather than in crystalline form. Celtra Press is characterized by a high strength of about 500 MPa and excellent flow properties during pressing.</description>
