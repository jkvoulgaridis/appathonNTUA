  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose (MAD)
      study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PHP-303 in
      otherwise healthy overweight or obese volunteer subjects. Within each ascending dose cohort,
      subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive PHP-303 or placebo. The primary
      objective is to establish the safety and tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      orally-administered PHP-303.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, ≥ 18 to ≤ 60 years of age.

          -  In good general health having no clinically significant diseases in medical history or
             evidence of clinically significant findings on physical examination, vital signs,
             laboratory results, and/or ECG at Screening, in the opinion of an Investigator.

          -  Willing to forego other forms of experimental treatment during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant condition that, in the opinion of an Investigator, could
             preclude the safe participation of the subject in the study or would prevent the
             subject from meeting the study requirements.

          -  Major surgery in the 6 months preceding Screening.

          -  Clinically-significant abnormal laboratory parameters.

          -  Positive urine drug test for alcohol, cotinine, and/or drugs of abuse (cocaine,
             tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamines, methamphetamines, or benzodiazepines) at Screening
             or on admission to the study site.

          -  Electrocardiographic Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) interval &gt; 450 msec for
             males and &gt; 470 msec for females, or any other clinically significant
             electrocardiographic abnormality.

          -  Blood pressure results &gt; 150 mmHg systolic or &gt; 95 mmHg diastolic

          -  Female subject who is pregnant (positive pregnancy test at the Screening Visit or on
             admission to the study site), lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the
             study period or within 3 months after the final dose of study medication.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within 1 year prior to Screening.

          -  History of cigarette smoking within 3 months of Screening.

          -  Known intolerance to lactose.

          -  Regular use of prescription drugs within 14 days of the first administration of study
             drug or non-prescription (over-the-counter) drugs within 7 days of the first
             administration of study drug or unwilling to abstain from prohibited medications
