      Introduction With increasing age the incidence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) rises and will
      increase substantially in the future according to forecasting studies. It is possible that
      oestrogens, alone or in combination with other forms of therapy, may assist in the management
      of POP by increasing collagen synthesis and thereby improving the strength of the weakened
      vaginal epithelium. Yet, studies investigating the effect of topical oestrogen and its impact
      on POP associated symptoms, both self-reported improvement and observations of objective
      improvement, are lacking.

      Objective To evaluate the subjective efficacy concerning prolapse associated complaints
      measured by the German pelvic floor questionnaire (domain POP: POP-score) after preoperative
      use of local oestrogen compared to preoperative placebo treatment in postmenopausal women
      with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. Further variables of interest are POP-score after 3
      months, differences regarding the objective prolapse quantification system (POP-Q), surgical
      outcome and tissue operability assessed by the surgeon.

      Methods In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study
      the investigators aim to include 120 postmenopausal women with symptomatic pelvic organ
      prolapse and indicated operative procedure. An analysis of covariance will be computed with
      the depending variable POP-score after 6 weeks and the independent variables group (verum
      versus placebo) and Pop-Score at baseline.
