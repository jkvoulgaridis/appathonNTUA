    <textblock>
      In this parallel randomized controlled trial (n = 33/group), the control group received
      routine care, while the intervention group received a telephone follow-up intervention, which
      consisted of a pre-discharge education program and three telephone follow-up sessions based
      on the Roy Adaptation Model.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of education and telephone follow-up intervention based on
      the Roy Adaptation Model (RAM) for improving MI patients' self-efficacy, quality of life and
      lifestyle adaptation.

      Methods: In this parallel randomized controlled trial (n = 33/group), the control group
      received routine care, while the intervention group received a telephone follow-up
      intervention, which consisted of a pre-discharge education program and three telephone
      follow-up sessions based on the RAM. Data were collected before discharge, and in the 12th
      week after discharge included quality of life, coping adaptation process, self-efficacy and
      lifestyle changes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The self-efficacy levels of the patients were measured by the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). The GSES contains 10 items and each item score ranges from 0 to 5. Cronbach's α of the GSES was 0.83. The highest and lowest possible score is between 10-40. High score indicates that the individual perceives high self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Coping and Adaptation scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the coping and adaptation processes, the Coping and Adaptation (CAPS) scale was used. The CAPS was developed by Callista Roy. The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Çatal and Dicle (2015), and the Cronbach alpha value was 0.82 for the total scale. The highest and lowest possible score is between 47-188. Higher scores indicate better use of effective coping methods.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the quality of life after the disease, the Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale (MIDAS) was used. This was developed by Thompson et al. in 2002. The Cronbach alpha values of the scale were found in seven dimensions, and ranged from 0.74 to 0.95, showing it to be a useful and highly reliable tool. The validity and reliability study of the scale was made by Yilmaz et al. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.79 to 0.90. The 10 highest and lowest possible score is between 0-100, with 0 indicating the best health condition, and 100 indicating the worst health condition.</description>
