  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, 3-arm study to evaluate progression-free survival
      (PFS) in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer treated with intermittent or continuous regimens of relacorilant in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel compared with patients treated with nab-paclitaxel alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The goals of
      this study are to evaluate the efficacy of relacorilant either administered daily
      (continuous) or on the day prior, the day of, and the day after chemotherapy (intermittent)
      in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancers compared with nab-paclitaxel alone. The safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic profile of relacorilant in combination with
      nab-paclitaxel will also be assessed.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following three treatment arms.
      Patient randomization will be stratified by treatment-free interval from most recent taxane
      (relapsed within 6 months vs &gt;6 months) and presence of ascites (yes vs no).

        -  Arm A (Continuous relacorilant): Relacorilant starting at 100mg, administered orally,
           once daily every day in combination with nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each
           28-day cycle.

        -  Arm B (Intermittent relacorilant): Relacorilant 150mg, administered orally, on the day
           before (excluding Cycle 1, Day -1), the day of, and the day after nab-paclitaxel, in
           combination with nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

        -  Arm C (Comparator): Nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

      Patients will remain on study treatment until reaching a protocol-defined event of disease
      progression (PD), experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment
      discontinuation criteria are met. All patients will be followed for progression, subsequent
      therapies and survival. Patients in Arm C who experience unequivocal PD per RECIST v1.1 will
      be given the opportunity to receive relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel after
      discussion with the Medical Monitor.

          -  Signed and dated IRB/IEC-approved informed consent form (ICF) prior to study-specific
             screening procedures.

          -  Female patients aged ≥ 18 years old at time of consent.

          -  Histologic diagnosis of high grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary
             peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma. Clear cell, mucinous
             and borderline histologic subtypes are excluded.

          -  Received at least one line of therapy with evidence of cancer progression within 6
             months after the last dose of platinum-based therapy (i.e., having a platinum-free
             interval of &lt;6 months [platinum resistant]), or progressive disease during or
             immediately after primary platinum-therapy, (i.e.platinum refractory). Patients with
             primary platinum resistance (progression within 6 months of the last dose of
             first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy) are considered eligible.

        Notes: For the calculation of the platinum-free interval, cancer progression must be
        defined by clear evidence of progression, such as radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1.
        Calculating the platinum-free interval on the basis of increased CA-125 is not allowed.

          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST v1.1:

          -  Previously irradiated lesions are not allowed as measurable disease, unless there is
             documented evidence of progression in the lesions.

          -  To be eligible with non-measurable disease, patients must have evaluable disease with
             CA 125 at least twice the upper limit of reference range (of CA-125 ≥ 70 U/mL), along
             with radiographically evaluable disease by CT/MRI.

          -  Availability and consent to provide tumor tissue for biomarker assays (archival or
             recent biopsy).

          -  No more than 4 prior chemotherapeutic or myelosuppressive regimens (not including
             maintenance therapy such as single-agent bevacizumab or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
             [PARP] inhibitor). Patients with platinum-refractory cancer cannot have had more than
             2 prior lines of treatment for refractory disease.

          -  Appropriate to treat with nab-paclitaxel, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

             insufficiency (if present), and lack of malabsorption.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication and does not have uncontrolled emesis.

          -  Able to comply with protocol requirements.

             low user-dependency are:

               -  An IUD, provided that the subject has tolerated its use for at least 3 months
                  before the first dose of study medication and undertakes not to have it removed
                  for 1 month after the last dose.

               -  Abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when it is in line with the subject's
                  preferred and usual lifestyle. Periodic abstinence and withdrawal are NOT

             randomization.

          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks prior to randomization. If subject received major
             surgery including (curative or palliative surgery), they must have recovered
             adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to
             starting therapy.

                  excluded from the study. In equivocal cases, hepatitis B or C polymerase chain
                  reaction may be performed and must be negative for enrollment.

          -  Patient has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) or which in the opinion

          -  Concurrent treatment with mifepristone or other glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
             antagonists.

          -  Drugs with a narrow therapeutic ratio that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance
             should be avoided. Caution should be exercised when co-administering known inhibitors
             of CYP3A with relacorilant. Medicines/food known to strongly inhibit CYP3A should be
             avoided.

          -  Concurrent treatment on other investigational treatment studies for the treatment of
             ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
