  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic
      enlargement in men with transperineal laser ablation (TPLA) may offer advantages in
      functional outcomes and safety over current standard therapies. As the technique is
      relatively new, indications and outcomes for this treatment are subject of investigation.
      However, the technique is already applied outside clinical studies. Clinical information from
      these treatments can be useful for future research. The aim of this study is to collect data
      on patients treated with transperineal laser ablation of the prostate outside clinical trials
      and to provide data on safety and functional outcomes in these patients in order to improve
      treatment.

      Objective: To assess long-term efficacy of transperineal laser ablation for lower urinary
      tract symptoms, to assess functional outcomes, to assess safety, to determine baseline
      patient characteristics, to collect information on possible differences between centres
      applying treatment of transperineal laser ablation and to explore the optimal treatment
      indications and possible limitations.

      Study design: This is an international prospective observational study in which data is
      recorded of patients who are treated with transperineal laser ablation for lower urinary
      tract symptoms.

      Study population: Male patients treated with transperineal laser ablation for lower urinary
      tract symptoms due to benign prostatic enlargement.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is long-term efficacy of
      transperineal laser ablation for lower urinary tract symptoms measured by the time until
      surgical retreatment.

    <time_frame>12 months following TPLA treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The experienced functional efficacy is measured by change in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The IPSS is a is a self-administered scale of 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms plus one question concerning quality of life (QoL). Each of the seven symptoms includes the assignment of scores from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 points (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). The patient's quality of life (QoL) will be evaluated separately.</description>
