  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coordination between different levels of care has been identified as one of the main
      components of care among people with chronic diseases. In this sense, an adequate referral
      and counter-reference system facilitates the management of the care process with timely
      access to the required referral. The objective of this project is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy that improves the counter- referral process in
      patients with cardiovascular diseases in the public health system.

      Population: The study will be carried out in selected hospitals of the provinces of Mendoza,
      Tucum√°n and Salta in Argentina. Patients who have been hospitalized with a diagnosis of heart
      failure, hypertension (requires hospitalization) and / or coronary disease (unstable angina)
      will be included.

      Design and methods: a Randomized clinical study by clusters. 10 hospital will be included: 5
      will be randomly assigned to receive an intervention to increase the improve counter referral
      rates (improvement cycles) and 5 to the control branch (usual care). 51 participants will be
      included in each hospital, in total, 510 participants.

      Intervention: An innovative vision is proposed, which combines a participatory and dynamic
      methodology based on improvement cycles. This approach includes the implementation of
      participatory learning sessions for health providers, involving the effectors of the design
      of the intervention. In the intervention branch at least 6 workshops (sessions) will be held
      with the members of the care system, in order to identify opportunities for improvement
      oriented to the design and application of an innovative intervention based on best practices.
      Each one of the sessions will constitute an analysis of the improvement cycle, following the
      following steps: 1) Selection of participants of the initial workshop; 2) Development of work
      model based on bibliographic review and initial qualitative phase; 3) Initial workshop with
      effectors for training in continuous improvement, objectives, interventions and data
      collection; 4) Learning workshops to discuss results, applicability of interventions and
      modifications to the work plan; 5) Closing session to evaluate preliminary results and
      discuss continuity of interventions beyond the project.

      Outcomes: 1) consultation in the PHC after hospital discharge; 2) readmission's; 3)
      consultations in the hospital; 4) follow-up in the PHC; 5) patient perspective
      (satisfaction).

The Primary Care Assessment Tool was design to evaluate attainment of features in primary care settings. Attributes identified by the tool are first contact accessibility and use, continuity, and coordination in the primary level. The tool has been adapted and validated in several countries and settings. The global index for evaluation will be composed as the sum of 10 items, ranging from 10 to 40. To facilitate interpretation the score will be transformed to a scale of 0 -100 points ( score =100 x (sum -10)/40-10), with higher score indicating more favorable satisfaction.</description>
