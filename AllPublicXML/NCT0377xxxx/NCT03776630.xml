      This trial is a non-randomized, open label and multicenter study.

      It aims to :

      for endometrial cancer.:validate the 5-miR index assessed in plasma samples as a diagnostic
      marker to assess the risk of lymph node metastases for ovarian cancer : to validate the
      previous finding on the prognostic value of the pre-/post-treatment variation of miR200b
      plasma concentrations with regards to PFS (the investigators mean the primary treatment
      including up-front or post-chemotherapy debulking and adjuvant chemotherapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNAs (miRs) have been linked to carcinogenesis and can act as metastatic activators or
      suppressors. There is now ample evidence that circulating miRs can be used as biomarkers.
      This project is focused on ovarian (OC) and endometrial cancers (EC), respectively the
      deadliest and most frequent gynecologic malignancies.

      The main challenge for physicians managing women with early-stage EC is when to opt for
      lymphadenectomy. Tools that are currently used are not accurate enough to identify women with
      increased risk of nodal metastases. Ballester's team recently found a relationship between
      the high expression of a set of 5 miRs in the primary tumor and nodal status.

      OC is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancer. The prognosis depends on the
      response of the residual tumor mass to adjuvant chemotherapy. Currently, this response
      remains largely unpredictable and even difficult to monitor with CA125 measurements and
      current imaging techniques. Busson's team recently showed that the variation of plasma
      miR200b during primary treatment is predictive of progression-free survival (PFS).

      The study involves 3 populations of participants :

        -  Patients with EC

        -  Patients with OC Patients undergoing surgery for benign pelvic lesions (control
           population)

    <description>Two blood samples (2 tubes of 4 ml for each blood sample) will be collected per patient during the study period for EC and OC. One blood sample will be collected for control population. The first sample will be collected prior to any treatment for EC, OC, and control population.
For EC, the second collection will be done one month post-surgery. For OC, the second collection will be done 6 to 9 months after the initial diagnosis, in most cases at the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. For control population, there will be no second sample.</description>
