  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of different methods of
      broccoli preparation on levels of urinary glucosinolate metabolites. The secondary objective
      is to determine the effects of different methods of broccoli preparation on levels of plasma
      carotenoids.

      Consumption of Brassica vegetables (which include broccoli, cabbage, and kale) is inversely
      associated with the incidence of several cancers, including cancers of the lung, stomach,
      liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and ovaries. Brassica vegetables are a good source
      of many nutrients including glucosinolates and carotenoids. Glucosinolates are
      sulfur-containing compounds that are converted to bioactive metabolites by an enzyme called
      myrosinase, which is released when the vesicles containing myrosinase are ruptured by chewing
      or cutting. These bioactive compounds are considered to be active agents for cancer
      prevention. Their ability to reduce risk of cancer may derive in part from their ability to
      modulate foreign-substance metabolizing enzymes, which include enzymes called Phase I
      cytochrome P450s and Phase II enzymes. Carotenoids may also have a role in cancer prevention
      and other health benefits including reducing age-related macular degeneration, and therefore
      merit research to reveal factors that affect their presence in the body.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate how various preparations of broccoli impact
      levels of these healthful nutrients in humans.
