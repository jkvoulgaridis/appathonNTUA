    <textblock>
      A global study of oral risdiplam in pre-symptomatic participants with SMA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical study to investigate the
      efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in infants aged from
      birth to 6 weeks who have been genetically diagnosed with SMA but are not yet presenting with
      symptoms. There will be a screening, treatment, open-label extension (OLE) phase, and a
      follow-up period for any participants who withdraw early. All participants will receive
      risdiplam orally once daily for 2 years followed by an OLE phase of at least 3 years (with a
      follow-up of one year for those participants who withdraw early), with a total treatment
      duration of at least 5 years for each participant enrolled.
