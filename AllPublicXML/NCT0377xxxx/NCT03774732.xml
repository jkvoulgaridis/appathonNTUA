  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) remains short after the first line of treatment with a median OS of 12.2 months in
      non squamous NSCLC and 9.2 months in squamous NSCLC . In this setting the programmed death
      1/ligand 1 (PD-1/-L1) were targeted with nivolumab (IgG4) in advanced squamous and
      nonsquamous NSCLC leading to an increase of the 1-year OS rate of approximately 10-15% in
      both histologies. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are now considered a standard of
      care in 2nd line advanced NSCLC and in 1st line for pembrolizumab but but prognosis still
      remains poor in advanced NSCLC. Overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced (stage
      III/IV) NSCLC remains limited with a median OS of 12.2 months in non-squamous NSCLC and 9.2
      months in squamous NSCLC if anti-PD1 alone. It is of around 16 months if pembrolizumab is
      combined with chemotherapy.

      Preclinical data indicates that anti-tumor efficacy is increased when anti-PD-1/-L1 are
      combined with irradiation (IR). Radiotherapy alone can elicit tumor cell death which can
      increase tumor antigen in the blood stream, favoring recognition by the immune system and its
      activation against tumor cells outside of the radiation field (=&quot;abscopal effect&quot;).

      IR may also reverse acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy by limiting T-cell
      exhaustion.

      Because of these preclinical and clinical data several studies analysing the combination of
      IR and anti-PD1 in NSCLC are ongoing. Among them, two studies are testing the administration
      of IR and nivolumab in stage III NSCLC: the NCT02768558 phase III trial (RTOG), and the
      NCT02434081 phase II trial (ETOP). Antonia et al [2017] tested the use of anti-PD-L1 after
      chemoradiotherapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC. Median time to distant metastasis was
      increased (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months, p&lt;0.001). An increase of OS is consequently expected.

      However, no study involving concurrent RT and pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in
      advanced NSCLC is ongoing, which is the purpose of the present study, NIRVANA-Lung.

    <description>In the experimental arm, patients will receive the same treatment as the control arm (chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab) in addition with conformal 3D radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) that will be delivered at C2D1, 21 days after the beginning of pembrolizumab using photons/electrons with standard field encompassing tumour.
Irradiation technique (3D-CRT or SABR) will be at physician discretion. Ideally, oligometastatic patient (defined by the presence of less than 6 metastases) should be treated with SABR and those with non-oligometastatic disease should be treated with 3D-CRT.
Radiotherapy will be delivered a dose of at least 18 Gy in 3 X 6 Gy for 3D-CRT (cf. protocol for possible schemes and volumes restriction).
Irradiated tumor size will be ≤5 cm (GTV &lt;65 mL sphere); partial tumor irradiation should be delivered if larger tumor size while respecting dose constraints.</description>
