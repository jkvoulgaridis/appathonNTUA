  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficiency of pain relief and the safety of
      NPC-06 for the neuropathic pain associated with cancer, in addition to explore the effective
      concentration of NPC-06.

      The eligible patients will be randomized into three groups, and will receive NPC-06 (high
      dose), NPC-06 (low dose) or placebo once a day for 7 days.
