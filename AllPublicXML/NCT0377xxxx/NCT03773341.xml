    <textblock>
      The aim of work is to detect the patterns and the causes of ACL injury among Egyptian
      population and to identify its risk factors. Identify the male to female ratio of injuries in
      our community. To document the patterns and frequencies of associated injuries

    <textblock>
      The ACL (Anterior Cruciate ligament) is one of the most frequently injured ligaments of the
      knee, with a prevalence estimated to be 1 in 3000 in the US (greater than 120000 cases
      annually). ACL injury frequently affects young, active individuals. It is also frequently
      associated with other structural injuries in the Knee joint like meniscal tears and
      multi-ligamentous injuries. ACL injury leads to increased laxity in the knee, predispose the
      knee to subsequent injuries and early onset osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Sports related trauma is the commonest cause of ACL rupture. Females are reported to have 2
      to 10-fold higher risk of injury than males playing the same sport. According to previous
      studies at Assuit University Hospital the impression was that the ACL injuries are more
      common in males than females. Additionally, non-sports injuries like motor cycle accidents
      and domestic injuries are expected to be a major cause of ACL rupture, besides sports
      injuries, among Egyptian population.
