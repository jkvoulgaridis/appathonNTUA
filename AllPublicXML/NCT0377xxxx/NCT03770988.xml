  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Esophageal
      adenocarcinoma has become more common in Western countries. In many Asian countries, however,
      Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) represents the most common esophageal cancer. In
      palliative chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent ESCC, A combination of 5-fluorouracil and
      platinum was prescribed as a standard treatment for about 20 years. With this traditional
      regimen, the median progression free survival is approximately 7 months, and 1-year survival
      rate is reported to be 34%. Combinations of taxane and anthracycline are also considerable,
      but also shows the median survival less than one year. Though cytotoxic chemotherapy is
      current main treatment option, molecularly targeted agents are recently incorporated to
      improve survival in ESCC. There is a strong rationale for investigation of biologic agents
      targeting Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family in ESCC. EGFR is frequently
      overexpressed in esophageal cancer and is known to be associated with poor prognosis. Several
      EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been studied in esophageal cancer subjects and
      have shown clinical effects. In a recent Phase II trial using dacomitinib, pan-human
      epidermal growth receptor TKI, Partial response was observed in 10 of the 49 esophageal
      cancer subjects, with a response rate of 20.8%.

      Based on notable rationale in exploring impact of EGFR inhibition, we suggest multicenter
      phase II study to determine antitumor activity and safety of a other potent pan-HER
      inhibitor, Poziotinib in Esophageal Squamous cell carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Includes cases with
             pathologic findings with clinical course comparable to squamous cell carcinoma. For
             example, undifferentiated carcinoma)

          2. Diseases that can not achieve curative aim with radical surgery, radiation, or
             chemo-radiotherapy. Previous palliative chemotherapy including platinum-based agents
             for advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (If the disease
             progresses within 6 months after the curative platinum-based chemotherapy or disease
             progresses within 6 months after last adjuvant chemotherapy, it is considered to be
