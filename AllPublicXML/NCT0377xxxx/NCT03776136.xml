  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of lenvatinib
      (E7080/MK-7902) and pembrolizumab following approximately 2 years of pembrolizumab therapy
      and approximately 2 years or more lenvatinib therapy in adult participants with unresectable
      or advanced melanoma who have been exposed to anti-PD-1/L1 agents approved for unresectable
      or metastatic melanoma. No statistical hypothesis will be tested in this study.
