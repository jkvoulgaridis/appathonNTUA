  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Depression is a highly frequent condition in the elderly, with a huge impact on
      quality of life, life expectancy, and medical outcomes. SSRIs are commonly prescribed in
      elderly depressed patients and, although generally safe, they may be associated with
      tolerability issues. Based on available studies, vortioxetine is likely to have a promising
      tolerability profile in the elderly, as it does not adversely affect psychomotor or cognitive
      performance, wakefulness, body weight, and electrocardiogram parameters.

      Objectives. Assessing the comparative tolerability, safety and efficacy of vortioxetine
      compared with the SSRIs as a group (including sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram,
      paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) in elderly patients affected by major depression. The
      primary outcome will be the withdrawal rate due to adverse events.

      Methods. This is a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, superiority,
      randomized trial. Twelve Italian Community Psychiatric Services will consecutively enrol
      elderly patients suffering from an episode of major depression who get in contact over a
      period of 12 months. By employing the web-based application RedCap, doctors will be able to
      randomize patients to vortioxetine or one of the SSRIs, chosen on the basis of clinical
      judgment, and to collect basic socio-demographic and clinical data. Trained and blinded
      assessors will administer five validated rating scales: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS), Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist (ASEC), EuroQual 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D),
      Charlson Age-Comorbidity Index (CACI), and Short Blessed Test (SBT). Patients will be
      assessed after 1, 3 and 6 months.

      Expected results. On the basis of current literature, the investigators hypothesize
      vortioxetine to be superior to SSRIs as a group in terms of tolerability. As vortioxetine is
      expected to reduce the withdrawal rates due to adverse events of about 12% compared to SSRIs,
      and assuming that about 23% of the participants could be lost within 6 months, the
      investigators aim to enrol 358 patients (179 in each group).

    <description>The mean change score at the Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist (ASEC). ASEC is a validated rating scale, administered by the clinician, measuring the occurrence and severity of 21 adverse events of antidepressants drugs. For each side effect, a score between 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) is reported. Also, the likelihood of its association with antidepressants is assessed with a yes/no question. Single side-effects scores are summed to obtain a total score (ranging from 0 to 63).</description>

    <description>The number of participants with a reduction of at least 50% of the baseline score of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The MADRS is a validated rating scale, administered by the clinician, measuring the occurrence and severity of 10 symptomatic dimensions of depression. For each dimension, a score between 0 (normal, no symptoms) to 6 (severely impaired) is reported. Single scores for each dimension are summed to obtain a total score (ranging from 0 to 60).</description>

    <description>Mean change scores at the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a validated rating scale, self-administered, measuring the quality of life according to 5 dimensions. In addition, the overall health status on the day of the interview is measured on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst possible health status) to 100 (best possible health status). When interpreting the scale, dimensions are to be considered separately and not summed in a total score.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive performance as assessed by the SBT</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change scores at the Short Blessed Scale (SBT). The SBT is a validated rating scale, administered by the clinician, measuring the cognitive performance. The SBT is a screening tool that aids in detecting early cognitive changes associated with dementia disorders. Further testing is warranted if dementia is suspected, the SBT should not be used to diagnose dementia. This is a weighted six-item instrument that evaluates orientation, registration, and attention.</description>
