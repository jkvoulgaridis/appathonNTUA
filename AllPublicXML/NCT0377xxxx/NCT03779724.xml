      Objective: To evaluate the effects of isokinetic exercises on muscle strength, knee joint
      position sense, pain, kinesiophobia, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Fifty patients
      with multiple sclerosis. Interventions: Fifty patients who met the inclusion criteria were
      randomized to an isokinetic exercise (n:25) or home exercise programme (n:25). Sequentially
      numbered opaque envelopes were used for randomization.

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures were the peak torque/body mass index of quadriceps and
      hamstring muscles at 60°/s and 180°/s velocities, the hamstring/quadriceps ratios at the same
      velocities, absolute angular errors of the 15°, 45°, and 60° and the mean absolute angular
      error of joint position sense of the less and more affected knees, and the scores of Multiple
      Sclerosis Quality of Life-54, Visual Analogue Scale, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.

    <intervention_model_description>This prospective randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit 50 patients with MS from the physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic of Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Health Sciences University, Ankara, Turkey. Fifty patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Fifty patients were randomized to two groups: isokinetic exercise (Group 1) (n=25) and home exercise (Group 2) (n=25). Randomization was completed using sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes by the investigator. All patients gave informed consent before the assessment. The outcome measures were assessed initially and at eighth week after the treatment. Group 1 performed isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring strengthening exercises under supervision and Group 2 performed lower extremity muscle strengthening and balance exercises at home.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (10 minutes before the start of the treatment) and 8 weeks after start of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The peak torque/body mass index of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles at 60°/s and 180°/s velocities were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multijoint Pro 3) in Newton/meter. A definite muscle strength value has not been defined. Literally, healthy controls and patients are compared. Higher scores indicate better muscle strength.</description>

    <description>Absolute angular errors of the 15°, 45°, and 60° and the mean absolute angular error of the more and less affected knees were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multijoint Pro 3) with active-active angular reproduction method. Estimating the target angel procedure was repeated at 45°, 15°, and 60° and for both the more and less affected legs. After the joint position sense testing, three angles estimated by the patients were averaged, and the angular error was calculated for each target angle. Absolute angular error was calculated by averaging the angular errors, regardless of the numbers being negative or positive. The absolute angular error values of the three target angles were averaged to obtain the mean absolute angular errors. A definite angular error value has not been defined. Literally, healthy controls and patients are compared. Higher scores indicate worser joint position sense.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (10 minutes before the start of the treatment) and 8 weeks after start of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiophobia which is described as fear of movement and physical activity was evaluated using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, which is a 17-item self-report survey. The range of scores are from 17 to 68 where the higher scores indicate an increasing degree of kinesiophobia. If the total score was above 37 points, the patient was considered to have a high level of kinesiophobia.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (10 minutes before the start of the treatment) and 8 weeks after start of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and multiple sclerosis-specific symptoms in a single instrument. The 54 items are divided into 12 multi-item and 2 single-item scales.Health distress, overall quality of life, emotional well-being, role limitations-emotional and cognitive funtion items' final scores averaged and mental composite score was calculated. Physical function, health perceptions, energy/fatigue, role limitations-physical, pain, sexual function, social function, health distress items' final scores were averaged and physical composite score was obtained.Total score was obtained by averaging the mental and physical composite scores.Final scores can be between 0-100 points for total, mental, physical and pain scores. Higher values indicate better quality of life for total, physical and mental scores and worser pain levels for pain score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (10 minutes before the start of the treatment) and 8 weeks after start of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale. Using a ruler, a 10 cm line was drawn which provided a range of scores from 0-100. Than the patients marked the point that showed their pain intensity on this line. A higher score in Visual Analog Scale indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

        <description>Absolute angular errors of the 15°, 45°, and 60° and the mean absolute angular error of the more and less affected knees were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multijoint Pro 3) with active-active angular reproduction method. Estimating the target angel procedure was repeated at 45°, 15°, and 60° and for both the more and less affected legs. After the joint position sense testing, three angles estimated by the patients were averaged, and the angular error was calculated for each target angle. Absolute angular error was calculated by averaging the angular errors, regardless of the numbers being negative or positive. The absolute angular error values of the three target angles were averaged to obtain the mean absolute angular errors. A definite angular error value has not been defined. Literally, healthy controls and patients are compared. Higher scores indicate worser joint position sense.</description>

After the joint position sense testing, three angles estimated by the patients were averaged, and the angular error was calculated for each target angle. Absolute angular error was calculated by averaging the angular errors, regardless of the numbers being negative or positive. The absolute angular error values of the three target angles were averaged to obtain the mean absolute angular errors. A definite angular error value has not been defined. Literally, healthy controls and patients are compared. Higher scores indicate worser joint position sense.</description>

        <description>This is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and multiple sclerosis-specific symptoms in a single instrument. The 54 items are divided into 12 multi-item and 2 single-item scales.Health distress, overall quality of life, emotional well-being, role limitations-emotional and cognitive funtion items' final scores averaged and mental composite score was calculated. Physical function, health perceptions, energy/fatigue, role limitations-physical, pain, sexual function, social function, health distress items' final scores were averaged and physical composite score was obtained.Total score was obtained by averaging the mental and physical composite scores.Final scores can be between 0-100 points for total, mental, physical and pain scores. Higher values indicate better quality of life for total, physical and mental scores and worser pain levels for pain score.</description>

        <description>Pain intensity was evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale. Using a ruler, a 10 cm line was drawn which provided a range of scores from 0-100. Than the patients marked the point that showed their pain intensity on this line. A higher score in Visual Analog Scale indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

            <description>The isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multijoint Pro 3) was used for isokinetic exercises. The isokinetic exercise program was implemented over eight weeks, twice a week on non-consecutive days under the supervision of a doctor. The number of repetitions undertaken by the patients over the program were as follows: first week 5 at 60°/s and 10 at 180°/s, second week 10 at 60°/s and 15 at 180°/s, third week 15 at 60°/s and 20 at 180°/s, fourth week 20 at 60°/s and 30 at 180°/s, and in the last four weeks 20 at 60°/s and 40 at 180°/s angular velocities. Each block of 10 repetitions were performed as a set.
