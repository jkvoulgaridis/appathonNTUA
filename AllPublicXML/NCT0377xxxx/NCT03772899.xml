  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has helped many cancer patients in the last 5 years by enhancing a patient's
      immune system to fight cancer. Anti-Programmed Death (PD-1) immunotherapy drugs such as
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab remove the breaks from cancer-fighting immune cells and have been
      effective in treating some melanoma patients. Despite the major breakthrough of immunotherapy
      in oncology treatment, many patients do not respond to this new class of anti-cancer drugs.
      Recently, evidence suggests that the microorganisms living in a patient's intestines play a
      major role in modifying the response to anti-PD-1drugs. Patients who respond to these drugs
      have a unique and healthy group of microorganisms in their gut. Therefore, positive
      modification of a cancer patient's gut microorganisms to create a more diverse and healthy
      microbiome may improve the response to immunotherapy. One method of modifying the microbiome
      is Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) that is already being successfully used in the
      clinic to treat non-cancer patients with persistent bacterial infections.

      In this study, the investigators will combine FMT with the approved immunotherapy drugs
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab that are the standard of care for the treatment of advanced
      melanoma. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of combining these two therapies
      in melanoma patients. The investigator will use fecal material from a healthy donor selected
      via our stringent protocol that is Health Canada approved. In addition to assessing the
      safety of the combination, the investigator will also study the effect of FMT on the immune
      system and microbial ecosystem of the gut.

    <description>All patients in this trial will receive FMT at least one week prior to treatment with approved immunotherapy (either pembrolizumab or nivolumab). Samples for FMT are sourced at and by the microbiology group under the supervision of Dr. Silverman at St Joseph's Hospital. Donor screening procedures are described in appendix 4. Transplant will be from one single donor for all participants unless Dr. Silverman's lab considers the need for more than one donor based on availability of donors. There will be no &quot;mixture&quot; of donor samples.
Donor samples are manufactured into capsules according to Kao et al, 2017.</description>
