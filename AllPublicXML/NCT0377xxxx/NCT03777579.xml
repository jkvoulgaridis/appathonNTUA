  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy, safety of JS001
      administered with nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo in combination with nab-paclitaxel as
      first-line therapy in participants with primarily diagnosed stage IV and recurrent or
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not received prior systemic therapy
      for metastatic breast cancer (mBC).
