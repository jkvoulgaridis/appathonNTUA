  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to determine whether it is safe and practical to give
      CK0801 (a cord-blood derived T-regulatory cell product) to patients with Guillain-Barré
      Syndrome (GBS). Researchers also want to determine the highest possible dose that is safe to
      be given and to learn if CK0801 may improve the symptoms of GBS. There will be three doses of
      CK0801 given during this study. A minimum of three patients will be treated in each dose
      level. The dose a patient receives is dependent on the timing of when they enter the study,
      as after each dose level is completed the following patients will receive the next highest
      dose level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CK0801 (Cord blood-derived T-regulatory cells) consists of ex vivo expanded T-regulatory
      cells with a flow cytometry phenotype of ≥ 60% CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells and &lt; 10%
      CD4-CD8+ T-cytotoxic/suppressor cells. The cellular starting material of CK0801 is a single
      unit of umbilical cord blood (CBU) from a normal, healthy unrelated donor. Because Treg cells
      are present only at low frequency in circulating blood or umbilical cord blood, production of
      clinically relevant Treg cell doses requires ex vivo enrichment and expansion of Treg cells
      with a CD4+CD25+ phenotype. In their natural state, T-regulatory (Treg) cells play an
      important role in maintaining immune homeostasis and limiting autoimmune responses by
      modulating both innate and adaptive immunity. Based on literature reports of animal studies
      showing induction of immune tolerance by Treg cells in autoimmune diseases, graft-versus-host
      disease, and solid organ transplant rejection, the administration of Treg cells in human
      clinical trials has become an attractive strategy to induce immune tolerance in patients in a
      variety of clinical settings.

    <description>All subjects will receive adoptive therapy with an infusion of unrelated cord blood-derived regulatory T cells: CK0801. Subjects will receive one 50mL intravenous dose of CK0801 (Treg cells) on study Day 0. A total of three cohorts will be evaluated.
Cohort dosing will be as follows:
Dose level 1 = 1x10e6/kg Treg cells per kg recipient ideal body weight (IBW); Dose level 2 = 3x10e6/kg Treg cells per kg recipient ideal body weight (IBW); Dose level 3 = 1x10e7/kg Treg cells per kg recipient ideal body weight (IBW).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject fulfills the diagnostic criteria for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (Appendix
             1).

          2. HLA matched (≥ 3/6 at HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1) cord blood unit available for CK0801
             generation.

          3. Subjects age 18 to 70 years.
