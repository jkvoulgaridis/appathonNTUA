    <textblock>
      The present study wants to compare the Dexcom G6® continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system
      (experimental group) with the FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system (control
      group).

      The ALERTT1 trial will have three phases: a baseline, study, and extension phase.

      During the baseline phase, eligible patients will be screened for in- and exclusion criteria,
      wear a blinded Dexcom G6® for 28 days, together with their FreeStyle Libre FGM system, and
      receive a uniform education moment.

      In the study phase, patients will be randomized into two groups (1:1): the experimental group
      will use an unblinded Dexcom G6® CGM for 6 months, the control group will keep using the
      FreeStyle Libre FGM system for 6 months. Before the 6 month time point is reached, patients
      in the control group will wear a blinded Dexcom G6® CGM for 28 days, together with their
      FreeStyle Libre FGM.

      In the extension phase, patients in the initial control group will start using unblinded
      Dexcom G6® for 18 months. The initial experimental group will keep using the unblinded Dexcom
      G6® for the next 18 months.
