    <textblock>
      Closed-loop infusion system for target controlled infusion of propofol by using TCI pump
      designed by BD Technology. (Germany) guided with entropy and surgical pleth index (GE) will
      not only prevent awareness from Anesthesia but also optimise the dose anesthetic agents based
      on feedback from adequacy of Anesthesia monitoring. Which not only reduces Anesthesia agents
      but also enhances recovery from Anesthesia. Innovation using TCI combined with closed-loop
      controlled intravenous anesthesia under the guide of Entropy.In this study we performed a
      randomized, controlled, study to compare closed-loop control and open-loop control of
      propofol by using the Entropy and SPI guided closed-loop infusion system.

      Monitoring of Adequacy of Anesthesia using Entropy and Surgical pleth index to guide total
      intravenous anesthesia is more effective to maintain depth of anesthesia compared with target
      controlled infusion with open systems, it is unclear what driver and variables to achieve
      this goal be more physiological; in the literature doesn´t exist studies showing that the
      closed-loop system for hypnotic is better than the controlled algorithm based pharmacokinetic
      models and open loop system (target controlled infusion-TCI) to maintain anesthetic depth.
      Thus, a system was designed for intravenous anesthesia in closed loop for propofol as
      hypnotic based on neuromonitoring with Entropy and surgical pleth index as adequacy of
      Anesthesia depth.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of a closed loop TCI
      for administration of intravenous anesthesia using adequacy of anesthesia monitoring to
      maintain a depth of anesthesia compared to an open loop system TCI.
