  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This intervention study will investigate the relationship between consumption of
      selenium-fortified biscuits fortified with selenium-enriched yeast (approximately 60mcg of
      selenium per day for 14 days) and both plasma selenium concentration and plasma selenoprotein
      P concentration in adult human volunteers. It will also investigate how selenium-status may
      affect changes in sensory perception of the fortified biscuits when consumed for 7 and 14
      consecutive days (Flavour-Nutrient Learning).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are different forms of selenium supplementation which may be used to improve
      selenium-status, one being selenium-enriched yeast.

      Selenium is an essential micronutrient consumed through food, however the selenium contents
      of foods is variable, and depends upon the soil the food has been grown in. The UK population
      may not consume enough selenium through their diet, due to selenium levels in British soil
      being low and the use of North American wheat flour being increasingly replaced with lower
      selenium European flour.

      It is therefore relevant to explore the ability of selenium-enriched yeast to improve
      selenium status if initially low. It is also important to investigate if the sensory
      attributes of selenium-fortified foods are different to unfortified foods. Additionally,
      investigating Flavour-Nutrient Learning (how selenium-status might change sensory perception
      of selenium-rich foods) could improve understanding of food choices.

      This study aims to investigate the following topics:

        1. The relationship between selenium intake (through selenium-fortified biscuits) and
           selenium-status.

        2. How selenium-status affects sensory perception of selenium-fortified biscuits (Flavour
           Nutrient Learning, FNL).

    <intervention_model_description>There are three study groups (three 'test' biscuit flavours). Each study group will be assigned one test flavour ('intervention' flavour/biscuit). They begin consumption of their intervention biscuits on day 1 and finish on day 14. Plasma selenium concentration and sensory perception of biscuits will be measured on day 1 (baseline), 8 (post-7 days of intervention) and 15 (post-14 days of intervention).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in preference for the intervention flavour over two other test flavours and plain flavour, after 14 days of consumption of Se-fortified intervention-flavoured biscuits.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (baseline) and day 15 (post-14 days of intervention biscuit consumption).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants score their intervention flavour (the test flavour they eat for 14 days), two test flavours (not eaten for 14 days) and plain flavour using a visual analogue scale anchored by &quot;not very&quot;/0 and &quot;very&quot;/100. They do this for liking of smell, taste, texture, aftertaste and pleasantness of the overall eating experience. This is repeated three times (three plates of biscuits) in one food sensory test. Each attribute for each plate will have a 'preference score' calculated, using the following equation:
Preference score = (score of intervention flavour) - (average score of other 3 flavours).
Preference scores are then averaged across the three plates.
Flavour preference change is calculated as the change in average flavour preference score from baseline (day 1 food sensory test) to after 14 days of intervention biscuit consumption at home (day 15 food sensory test):
Preference change = day 15 score - day 1 score</description>
