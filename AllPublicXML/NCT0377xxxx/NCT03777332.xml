    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ocular- specific inclusion criteria apply to the study eye only, unless otherwise
        specified.

          1. Age greater than or equal to 60 years.

          2. Normal Luminance best corrected visual acuity of between 35 and 5 letters using Early
             Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (approximately between 20/200 and
             20/800 Snellen equivalent).

          3. Clinical diagnosis of GA of the macula secondary to AMD as determined by the
             Investigator and confirmed by the Reading Center.

          4. The GA lesion must meet the following criteria as determined by the central reading
             center's assessment of Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) imaging at screening:

               1. Total GA area must be ≥ 2.5 (1 disk areas [DA]).

               2. If GA is multifocal, at least one focal lesion must be ≥ 1.25 mm2 (0.5 DA), with
                  the overall aggregate area of GA as specified above in 4a.

          5. Adequate clarity of ocular media, adequate pupillary dilation, and fixation to permit
             the collection of good quality images as determined by the Investigator.

          6. Female subjects must be:

               1. Women of non-child-bearing potential (WONCBP), or

               2. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) with a negative serum pregnancy test at
                  screening and must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception for the
                  duration of the study and refrain from breastfeeding for the duration of the
                  study.

          7. Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use protocol
             defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain from donating sperm for the
             duration of the study.

          8. Willing and able to give informed consent and to comply with the study procedures and
             assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ocular specific exclusion criteria apply to the study eye only, unless otherwise specified.

          1. GA secondary to a condition other than AMD such as Stargardt disease, cone rod
             dystrophy or toxic maculopathies like plaquenil maculopathy in either eye.

          2. Spherical equivalent of the refractive error demonstrating &gt; 6 diopters of myopia or
             an axial length &gt;26 mm.

          3. Any history or active choroidal neovascularization (CNV), associated with AMD or any
             other cause, including any evidence of retinal pigment epithelium rips or evidence of
             neovascularization anywhere based on SD-OCT imaging and/or fluorescein angiography as
             assessed by the Reading Center.

          4. Presence of an active ocular disease that in the opinion of the Investigator
             compromises or confounds visual function, including but not limited to, uveitis, other
             macular diseases (e.g. clinically significant epiretinal membrane [ERM], full
             thickness macular hole) or uncontrolled glaucoma/ocular hypertension). Benign
             conditions in the opinion of the Investigator such as peripheral retina dystrophy are
             not exclusionary.

          5. Intraocular surgery (including lens replacement surgery) within 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

          6. History of laser therapy in the macular region.

          7. History of intraocular injection within 3 months prior to screening.

          8. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule. Note: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy for
             posterior capsule opacification done at least 60 days prior to screening is not
             exclusionary.

          9. Any ocular condition other than GA secondary to AMD that may require surgery or
             medical intervention during the study period or, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could compromise visual function during the study period.

         10. Any contraindication to IVT injection including current ocular or periocular
             infection.

         11. Participation in any systemic experimental treatment or any other systemic
             investigational new drug including within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the active
             ingredient (whichever is longer) prior to the start of study treatment. Note: clinical
             trials solely involving observation, over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets
             are not exclusionary.

         12. Medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make
             consistent follow-up over the 24-month treatment period unlikely, or would make the
             subject an unsafe study candidate.

         13. Any screening laboratory value (hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis) that in the
             opinion of the Investigator is clinically significant and not suitable for study
             participation.

         14. Known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium for injection or hypersensitivity to
             APL-2 or any of the excipients in APL-2 solution.
