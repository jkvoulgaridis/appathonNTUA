  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diet components are important factors in pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders, especially in the irritable bowel syndrome. Fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) are a group of short chain, poorly
      absorbed and osmotically active carbohydrates, which can induce gastrointestinal symptoms
      because of rapid fermentation in different segments of the gut. Low FODMAP diet is a novel
      treatment option with proven efficacy in reducing symptoms of functional gastrointestinal
      disorders in adults. Conversely, although functional abdominal pain is a common health
      problem in children, the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet remains understudied in this
      population.

      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two diets: a low FODMAP diet and a diet
      based on standard dietary advice of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      (NICE), on abdominal symptoms in children with functional abdominal pain.
