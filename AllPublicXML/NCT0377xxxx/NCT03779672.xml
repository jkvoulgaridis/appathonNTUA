    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential benefit of memantine hydrochloride as treatment for
      children with epileptic encephalopathy using a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over
      design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Memantine, a drug approved for Alzheimer's dementia, exerts its therapeutic effect through
      its action as a low to moderate affinity non-competitive (open channel) N-methyl-D-aspartate
      receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation
      channels. It blocks the effects of persistently elevated levels of glutamate that may lead to
      neuronal dysfunction. Memantine may also have anti-inflammatory effects. Memantine has been
      used off-label in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, to improve the
      cognitive impairment.

      Epileptic encephalopathy, as well as other forms of epilepsy, may occur as a result of
      multiple etiologies, including genetic and inflammatory pathologies. Ion channels were long
      considered to be implicated in genetic epilepsy. Indeed one of the many possible causes of
      epilepsy is NMDA receptor dysfunction.

      In the present study, the investigators plan to investigate the potential benefit of
      memantine as a treatment for epileptic encephalopathy. A double-blind placebo-controlled
      cross-over design will be used, with participants receiving 6 weeks of memantine and 6 weeks
      of placebo, with a 2-week washout period in between.

    <measure>EEG Change with Memantine</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 or 14</time_frame>
    <description>EEG improvement EEG Change: EEG is not a quantitative measure, and there are many possible different patterns that may be seen in epileptic encephalopathy. In general, improvement usually involves (a) background activity changing to more closely resemble the expected background activity for the patient's age, and/or (b) decrease in frequency of epileptiform activity. The electroencephalographer will compare EEGs to the baseline study, and will score as (1) Interval worsening, (2) No significant change, or (3) Interval improvement.
We will be assessing all the frequencies usually assessed on a routine EEG (delta, theta, alpha and beta). The frequency range assessed will be 1-70 Hz.</description>
