    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to see if proactive identification and team based individualized care
      of cancer patients having emotional difficulties can improve quality of life relative to
      treatment as usual. Also, to see if proactive approaches to maintain wellness can prevent
      grief among breast cancer patients, experiencing no emotional difficulties relative to
      treatment as usual.
