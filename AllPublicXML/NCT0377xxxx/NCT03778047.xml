    <textblock>
      This is a study for evaluating enzalutamide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and
      related changes after drug switch in Chinese patients with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer. The study primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of enzalutamide in Chinese patients with mCRPC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily participated in the study, with understanding of and will to comply with

          5. Patients with relapsed, refractory, or progressive disease despite castration (surgery
             or chemical) or combined androgen deprivation therapy. (Progressive disease is defined
             as 1 or more of the following 3 criteria: PSA progression: A minimum of 3 rising PSA
             values with an interval of at least 1 week between determinations, resulting in a
             final value higher than 50% of the minimum, with a starting PSA value &gt; 2 ng/ml; Soft
             tissue disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1; Bone progression as defined by
             PCWG2 with 2 or more new lesions on bone scan);

          6. Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dl) at screening; bilateral orchiectomy or
             ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with effective GnRH analogues;

          7. ECOG performance status ≤1;

          8. Laboratory tests must meet the following criteria:

                  prior to screening); absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; Platelet
                  Count (PLT) ≥ 80 x 109/L;

               2. Blood Biochemistry: creatinine (Cr) ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or Cr &gt; 2
                  x ULN but the calculated CrCl ≥ 60 ml/min; bilirubin (BIL) ≤2 x ULN; alanine
                  aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x
                  ULN for patients with liver metastases);

               3. Coagulation: INR &lt; 1.5.

               3. Past medical history of seizures, serious CNS diseases, or unexplained coma,
                  family history of seizures, or history of traumatic brain injury;

               4. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 100 mmHg) or other
                  serious cardiovascular diseases. (Patients with a history of hypertension is

               5. Significant GI dysfunction which may affect the intake, transport, or absorption
                  of drug (such as inability to swallow, chronic diarrhea, and bowel obstruction,
                  etc.), or patients with complete gastrectomy;

               6. Other uncontrolled clinical diseases, including but not limited to: persistent or

               2. Treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), estrogen, or
                  cyproterone within 4 weeks prior to screening;

               4. Previously treated with investigational or approved medications that inhibit
                  testosterone synthesis (such as abiraterone acetate, TAK-683, and TAK-448) or
                  target testosterone receptors (such as SHR3680, proxalutamide, and ARN509),
                  except for bicalutamide and flutamide.

          5. Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drugs (enzalutamide and HC-1119)
