  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle and physical activity play an important role in in growth, development and bone health
      in healthy children, especially during puberty. Children with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) have lower level and intensity of physical compared to a control group. Several studies
      have shown that children with IBD have a lower bone mineral density (BMD) than general
      population, due to risk factors such as corticosteroid use, disease intensity, inflammation,
      malnutrition and a vitamin D deficiency. This low BMD is associated with an increased risk of
      fracture. A recent observational study found a positive and significant correlation between
      BMD in IBD patients and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity for one week
      (unpublished data).The present study aims to show a benefit of an adapted physical activity
      program on BMD in children and adolescents with IBD.

             since at least 6 months.

          -  Computer and internet access at home.
