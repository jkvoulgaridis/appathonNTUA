  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies indicate that obese teenagers exhibit memory disturbances. Adolescence
      represents a crucial period in the development of the hippocampus and the amygdala, necessary
      for the implementation of memory and emotional functions for the rest of life. Disturbances
      of the interaction between amygdala and hippocampus during adolescence have been associated
      with the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the impact of juvenile obesity
      on functional amygdala-hippocampus connectivity has not been evaluated yet. The main
      objective of this study is to compare the emotional memory performance and the level of
      functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala during the realization of an
      emotional associative memory task, in obese and control adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity increases the prevalence of cognitive impairment. In particular, it can promote
      disturbances of contextual memory dependent on the hippocampus. Obesity is also associated
      with negative emotional consequences. However, no clinical study has so far evaluated the
      effect of obesity on emotional memory, a function underpinned by the amygdala. Recent studies
      indicate that obese children and adolescents exhibit memory disturbances. Adolescence
      represents a crucial period in the development of the hippocampus and the amygdala, two brain
      regions implicated in memory and emotional functions for the rest of life. Changes in
      connectivity during development, whether structural or functional, are major before the age
      of 10 and progressive and minor until the age of 30. Disturbances of this
      amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity during adolescence have been associated with the
      development of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the impact of childhood obesity on
      functional amygdala-hippocampus connectivity has still not been evaluated. The first aim of
      the study is to compare the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and the amygdala
      measured during the realization of an emotional associative memory task or at rest before and
      after the task between obese teenagers and control teenagers and how closely it is related to
      emotional memory performances. Secondly, it will be determined whether the level of
      functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala is related to cognitive
      performances and eating symptomatology in obese teenagers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the level of connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus recorded during the execution of an emotional memory task in the scanner.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala during the performance of the task will be measured through the fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal obtained in activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the performance of an associative emotional memory task. The level of functional connectivity between two brain regions will be deduced from the temporal correlation between the fluctuations of the BOLD signal between these two regions. This coefficient will be normalized in Z-score before analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus before and after the task will also be recorded at rest.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of functional connectivity at rest will be measured before and after the task performed in the scanner. The fluctuations of the BOLD signal recorded at rest (while the subject is quietly resting eyes closed in the machine without being engaged in the performance of a task) also makes it possible to measure levels of functional connectivity of rest between two brain regions according to a method a little different from that applied to activation images (after filtering high frequencies). A Z-score reflecting the level of connectivity will be calculated before statistical analysis.</description>

    <measure>&quot; Paired Associates Learning Task &quot; administrated through the CANTAB neuropsychological examination</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Paired Associates Learning assesses visual memory and new learning. Administration time: 8 minutes Task format: Boxes are displayed on the screen and are &quot;opened&quot; in a randomised order. One or more of them will contain a pattern. The patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time and the participant must select the box in which the pattern was originally located. If the participant makes an error, the boxes are opened in sequence again to remind the participant of the locations of the patterns. Increased difficulty levels can be used to test high-functioning, healthy individuals.
Outcome measures include the errors made by the participant, the number of trials required to locate the pattern(s) correctly, memory scores and stages completed.</description>

    <measure>the number of distinct words for the free-recall phase (&quot; Verbal Recall/Recognition Memory Task &quot; administrated through the CANTAB neuropsychological examination)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal Recognition Memory assesses verbal memory and new learning. It measures the ability to encode and subsequently retrieve verbal information, with recall tapping into fronto-temporal networks and recognition assessing hippocampal areas.
Administration time: 10 minutes Task format : The participant is shown a sequence of words on screen one by one. The participant is then tasked with recalling the words, whilst a rater marks which ones they remembered. In the next phase, the participant is presented with two words, one from the original list and one distractor and is asked to choose which one they have seen before, in a 2-force choice paradigm. The latter recognition phase is then repeated after a delay.

    <description>The Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) measures the ability to identify six basic emotions in facial expressions along a continuum of expression magnitude.
Administration time: 6-10 minutes Task format: Computer-morphed images derived from the facial features of real individuals, each showing a specific emotion, are displayed on the screen, one at a time. Each face is displayed for 200ms and then immediately covered up to prevent residual processing of the image. The participant must select which emotion the face displayed from 6 options (sadness, happiness, fear, anger, disgust or surprise).
