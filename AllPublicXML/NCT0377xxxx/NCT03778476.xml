      inhibition of pain in individuals with fibromyalgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain condition that is characterized by widespread
      pain which affects 5-8% of the general population. Past research has shown that people with
      FMS demonstrate enhanced pain facilitation and reduced pain inhibition in the central nervous
      system. Incorporating a biopsychosocial model of pain may help develop strategies to prevent
      the functional decline and alleviate the suffering that occurs in this population. Exercise
      is a mainstay of pain rehabilitation with multiple health benefits, one of which is
      decreasing pain; a phenomenon known as exercise induced hypoalgesia (EIH). Emerging evidence
      has shown that exercise decreases pain facilitation in healthy adults and in some individuals
      with FMS. However, it's unclear whether exercise improves pain inhibition in individuals with
      FMS. The purpose of this study is to investigate endogenous pain inhibition, measured by
      conditioned pain modulation (CPM), following isometric exercise of the quadriceps muscle in
      individuals with FMS. In addition, factors that might affect this response such as physical
      activity, body composition, and psychosocial issues will be examined. Understanding how
      exercise impacts pain and the contributing factors will help guide the prescription of
      exercise to optimize pain rehabilitation.

    <description>the change in pressure pain threshold (kPa) during or after the immersion of the foot in a cold water bath (approximately 6 degrees) compared with baseline (before foot submersion) constitutes the measure of conditioned pain modulation in this study.</description>

    <description>in both sessions, pain intensity will be evaluated during ice water bath immersion (i.e. before and after exercise or quiet rest) and during exercise using an 11-point NPRS with 0 being no pain and 10 worst pain possible.</description>
