      The aims of this study were to: -

        -  Evaluate PBF in upper and lower teeth during orthodontic alignment using fixed
           appliances (0.014&quot; super elastic NiTi arch wire) at different time intervals (20min,
           48h, 72h and 1 month) of initial arch wire placement.

        -  Evaluate the PBF in upper and lower teeth during orthodontic teeth alignment using clear
           aligners at different time intervals (20min ,48h, 72h and 1 month) of fitting the second
           aligner (first active aligner).

        -  Compare the PBF changes between the above two different types of orthodontic appliances
           (fixed appliances and the clear aligners).

      Aims: to evaluate the pulpal blood flow (PBF) during orthodontic teeth alignment and leveling
      using clear aligners (second aligner) and fixed orthodontic appliance at different time
      intervals of orthodontic force application.

      Materials and Methods: A total of 45 subjects were subdivided in two groups: group 1: 25
      subjects treated with pre-adjusted edgewise fixed appliance with 0.014 inch NiTi as the
      alignment arch wire and group 2: 20 subjects treated using clear aligner. In both groups, PBF
      was measured for the upper right and the lower left using Laser Doppler Flowmetry at
      different time interval (20 minutes, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 month) after the fitting of the
      arch wire in group one and after the delivery of the second aligner in group two.
