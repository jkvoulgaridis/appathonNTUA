    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center 1:1 randomized trial to compare efficacy and safety of a
      stent-avoiding (using drug coated balloons) versus a stent-preferred (using drug eluting or
      interwoven stents) approach for treatment of complex femoropopliteal lesions TASC II
      (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease)
      Type B-D (stenosis &gt;10cm, occlusions &gt;5cm).

      Prospective, multi-center 1:1 randomized Study.

      Patients will be stratified according to a stent-avoiding (study arm) or stent-preferred
      (control arm)

      In total 120 patient will be enrolled in this study, each strata will include 60 patients.

      All enrolled patients will be followed up for 24 month to asses the incidence of restenosis
      by duplex ultrasound and major adverse events.

      Follow-up visits occur at 6, 12 and 24 month intervals as well as telephone visit after 1,36,
      48 and 60 month.

    <measure>Walking capacity - Walking capacity assessed by Walking impairment questionnaire score at 6, 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The graded score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each distance, speed, or number of stair flights. The products are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (representing the inability to perform any of the tasks) to 100 (representing no difficult with any of the tasks)</description>

    <measure>Ankle-brachial index - Clinical improvment assessed by Ankle-brachial index at 6, 12 and 24 month</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle by the systolic blood pressure in the arm. An ABI between and including 0.9 and 1.2 considered normal (free from significant PAD), while a lesser than 0.9 indicates arterial disease</description>

    <description>This classification system consists of four grades and seven categories (categories 0-6):
Grade 0, Category 0: asymptomatic Grade I, Category 1: mild claudication Grade I, Category 2: moderate claudication Grade I, Category 3: severe claudication Grade II, Category 4: rest pain Grade III, Category 5: minor tissue loss; ischemic ulceration not exceeding ulcer of the digits of the foot Grade IV, Category 6: major tissue loss; severe ischemic ulcers or frank gangrene</description>
