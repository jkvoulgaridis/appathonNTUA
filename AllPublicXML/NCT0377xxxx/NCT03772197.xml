  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recurrence index for distant recurrence (RI-DR), an 18-gene-based clinical-genomic model,
      has been developed for early-stage breast cancer (EBC). In this study, Investigators compared
      the prognostic performance of the RI-DR with the Oncotype DX (ODx) recurrence score (RS) for
      any recurrence risk type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With improved diagnosis, breast cancer can now be detected at early stages, thus improving
      survival rates. However, overtreatment is common; considering that the risk of recurrence is
      low, patients may suffer from side effects without receiving the full benefits of adjuvant
      therapies.

      To overcome the imprecision of prognosis based on clinicopathologic factors, genomic tests
      for breast cancer prognosis, such as the Oncotype DX® (ODx), MammaPrint®, and EndoPredict®
      assay kits, are frequently utilized. These multigene panels were development based on
      Caucasian populations, and may not suitable to Asian population due to the differences in the
      incidence and lifestyle of breast cancer patients from different ethic backgrounds. To fiil
      this gap, an 18-gene classifier (18-GC) based on the gene-expression profiling of Chinese
      breast cancer patients was developed

      In the current study, investigators combined clinical variables and genetic information to
      generate a clinical-genomic model: RI-DR, a recurrence index for distant recurrence (based on
      a genomic model and 6 clinical variables: age, tumor size, lymph node status, estrogen
      receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, tumor grading).

      By using tissues that have been tested with ODx, in this study, investigators evaluated the
      performance of the RI-DR model with that of the ODx assay in the prognosis assessment of a
      cohort of patients from Taiwan.

        This study is a local validation and multi-center study. A total of 118 early-srage breast
        cancer (EBC) patients were included in this head-to-head comparison study, including 42,
        15, and 81 patients treated between 2010 and 2016 at McKay Memorial Hospital, Koo
        Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center, and National Taiwan University Hospital,
        respectively, in Taiwan
