  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Given the high risk of
      death and disability, it is important for parents to understand the complications of
      prematurity so they can make decisions for their child. Unfortunately, these discussions
      often occur in the acute setting of threatened preterm labor when stress and anxiety make
      comprehension difficult. This study aims to improve parental understanding by providing early
      education of prematurity in the clinic setting for patients at high risk of preterm delivery.

    <description>Evaluation of parental anxiety associated with prematurity using validated six-item short-form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measures presence and severity of anxiety. The inventory consists of two self-reporting subscales that evaluate the current state of anxiety (state anxiety subscale), as well as the propensity towards being anxious (trait anxiety subscale). The range for total score is 20-80, with a higher score indicating greater anxiety. The six-item version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI: Y-6 item) is composed of three-questions from the original state anxiety subscale and three-questions from the original trait anxiety subscale. This shortened six-item inventory is a reliable and valid instrument when compared to the full forty-question inventory.</description>
