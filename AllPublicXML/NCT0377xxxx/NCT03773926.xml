  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuro-feedback for treating tinnitus seem to be a promising approach to help people suffering
      from chronic tinnitus. The past studies on this approach suffered interindividual variability
      in their results. The investigators' current hypothesis is that the variability of the
      results is the consequences of two possible flaws: lack of appropriate patient selection and
      lack of support of the patient during the therapy. This study is aimed at testing these
      hypotheses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with tinnitus have abnormal oscillatory brain activity in their temporal
      areas (Weisz et al. (2005), Schlee et al. (2014)). Led by this finding, attempts to normalize
      such localized pathological activity by neuro-feedback techniques have been tested (Dohrmann
      et al. (2007), Gütenspenger et al. (2017)). These attempts highlighted interindividual
      variability that can be explained by lack of selection of the patient population and lack of
      guidance through the therapy. The present study is aimed at addressing these issues by
      choosing more selectively a patient subpopulation (tinnitus associated with moderate hearing
      loss) and by implementing a guidance interface during the treatment.

      The therapy will consist of 10 neuro-feedback training sessions of 29 minutes over 5 weeks.
      Each session will be composed of 6 blocks of 3 min in which the patient will be incited to
      practise a specific cognitive strategy (mental exercise such as &quot;think to a music you like&quot;)
      and resting state measurements.

      Each patient who has been recruited to fit our inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will
      first go through a clinical assessment of his initial judgment criteria metrics. Then
      subjects will go through the 5-week training and then will be evaluated on the same criteria
      just after the end of the therapy and at 3 months after the end of it.

    <time_frame>Comparison of initial and final THI before and after treatment for a Time frame of 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This primary outcome measure denotes the evolution of the deterioration of the quality of life of patients due to tinnitus. THI is a questionnaire composed of 25 questions each with 3 response options converting in 0, 2, and 4 points scoring, making it a scale from 0 to 100 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of initial and final Visual Analog Scale (VAS) distributions</measure>
    <time_frame>Comparison of initial and final VAS before and after treatment for a Time frame of 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure denotes the evolution of the intensity of tinnitus and the disturbance associated measured by two scales. First the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for intensity of Tinnitus enables the patient to rate his tinnitus intensity with integers values between 1 to 10 (included). Second, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Tinnitus associated disturbance enables the patient to rate his tinnitus associated diturbance with integers values between 1 to 10 (included). For both scales, a high value (near 10) indicates a high gravity of the symptom, regarding either its intensity or its associated disturbance, while low values (near 1), indicate lighter impact of the symptom regarding its intensity or its associated disturbance. The scores are assessed subjectively by the patient when asked.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of maintenance of effects perceived 3 months after the treatment. The THI and the VAS scales are used similarly to the precedent outcome measures. THI is a questionnaire composed of 25 questions each with 3 response options converting in 0, 2, and 4 points scoring, making it a scale from 0 to 100 points. the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for intensity of Tinnitus enables the patient to rate his tinnitus intensity with integers values between 1 to 10 (included). The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Tinnitus associated disturbance enables the patient to rate his tinnitus associated diturbance with integers values between 1 to 10 (included). For both visual analog scales, a high value (near 10) indicates a high gravity of the symptom, regarding either its intensity or its associated disturbance, while low values (near 1), indicate lighter impact of the symptom regarding its intensity or its associated disturbance.</description>

    <description>EEG headset is placed on the patients head and the electrodes record the brain activity from F3, F4, FC1 and FC2 (on the 10-10 international localization system of EEG electrodes) and generate feedback.
Each session is composed of 6 blocks of 3 minutes in which the patient is incited to practice a specific cognitive strategy. During the 4 first session, 8 strategies are explored. Then through the therapy, the best cognitive strategies are gradually selected through an automatized process taking in account objective performances and subjective feedback.</description>
