  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of delivering a very early
      mobility rehabilitation program in Intensive Care Units (ICU), within the context of a
      randomised controlled trial (RCT). This will inform the design of a future RCT investigating
      very early ICU rehabilitation in the UK National Health Service.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early ICU-based physical rehabilitation may benefit patients with acute severe respiratory
      failure by attenuating the development of severe and persistent weakness and impaired
      physical function seen in these patients.

      Muscle wasting occurs early (within 12 hours) and progresses rapidly after ICU admission.
      Patients may suffer from consequent physical impairment for months or years following their
      discharge.

      ICU based rehabilitation has the potential to improve physical function outcomes, through
      mitigating muscle wasting.

      The investigators have successfully introduced a very early ICU mobility program in their
      institution, which results in increased ventilator free days and reduced length of ICU stay.

      The primary aim is to investigate whether this method will work in other ICUs. EMPRESS will
      test the feasibility of running this intervention as an RCT. The results and a concurrent
      process evaluation will inform the design of a future, multi-centre randomised controlled
      trial.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Frailty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An 8 point score to classify patients as fit, vulnerable or frail and correlates with outcome in both elderly and younger patients. Pre illness frailty will be assessed by proxy on admission from information gathered from family member /NOK and from patient at the 3 follow-up assessment</description>

    <measure>Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel ADL index is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL).
Each performance item is rated on this scale with a given number of points assigned to each level or ranking. It uses ten variables describing ADL and mobility. A higher number is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence following discharge from hospital.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive system comprises self-assessment of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
