             treatment

             have had another malignancy in the past, but have been disease-free for more than 5
             years, and subjects who have had a localized malignancy treated with curative intent
             and disease free for more than 2 years are eligible

         12. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 30 days prior

             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for participation in this study
