    <textblock>
      Study to evaluate the efficiency of vaginal estriol, as a treatment for urogenital symptoms
      in female patients with RRMS. The secondary objective is to evaluate the potential role of
      vaginal estriol in re-myelination in RRMS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilot project to determine the effectiveness of 1 mg transvaginal estriol, as an adjunctive
      therapy for female MS patients. The goal is to recruit 20 patients from the MS clinic in the
      neurology department of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. This study has been
      planned in collaboration with reproductive endocrinology, endocrinology, gynecology and basic
      science. The 1mg transvaginal dose was chosen after careful search of the literature and
      consultation with collaborators.

      Single-group pilot study.

      Subjects:

      Patients with relapsing remitting MS and urogenital symptoms (frequency, urgency, frequent
      urinary tract infections, incontinence) will be invited to participate in the study.
      Enrollment will be during their scheduled clinic appointment. Some candidates (patients of
      the primary investigator) may be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the study.

      The clinical trial will be explained to potential participants in detail, reviewing the
      objectives and methodology of the study. There will be adequate time allotted to answer any
      questions or concerns from the potential participants. Those patients interested in
      participating in the study will be asked to sign the consent form. In order to remind
      patients about their follow-up visits, lab work, etc., they will be contacted routinely.
      Participants will be instructed to call in case of questions or concerns.

      Patients will be evaluated clinically during their scheduled follow up in which a full
      neurological exam will be performed during each visit. Patients will be instructed by the
      primary investigator how to correctly use the vaginal cream. This will be done at their
      enrolment and reinforced by the principal investigator, during their follow up visits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficiency of vaginal estriol, as a treatment for urogenital symptoms in female patients with RRMS. In order to evaluate urogenital changes after the use of estriol, patients will fill a bladder control scale at baseline, 3 and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Female patients with RRMS and urogenital symptoms (urgency, frequency, intermittent incontinence) that would like to participate, will be given a bladder control scale at baseline, 3 and 9 months after starting transvaginal estriol.
The bladder control scale is a four-item questionnaire that provides a brief assessment of bladder control and the extent to which bladder problems have an impact on everyday activities. It is a self-report questionnaire that the patient can generally complete with little or no intervention from an interviewer.
The questions are regarding control of the bladder, number of accidents in the past 4 weeks, alteration of activities because of bladder problems and restriction on lifestyle because of bladder problems.The total score for the BLCS is the sum of the scores for the 4 items. . Scores can range from 0-22, with higher scores indicating greater bladder control problems.</description>

    <measure>Patients will also fill a three day voiding questionnaire at baseline, 3 and 9 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Female patients with RRMS and urogenital symptoms (urgency, frequency, intermittent incontinence) that would like to participate, will be given three day voiding questionnaire at baseline, 3 and 9 months after starting transvaginal estriol. This questionnaire has been validated to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms and woman, it consists of a 3-day diary of the urinary symptoms.
Patients have to record time of day which they went to bed and woke up and time of day of voiding. Also they record their fluid intake, there are toilet voids, the amount of urine in case this was drained by a catheter, leaks, number of pad changes if applicable.</description>
