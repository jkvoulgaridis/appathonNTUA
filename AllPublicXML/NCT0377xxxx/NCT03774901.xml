  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell penile carcinoma
      (SPC) who are in response or with stable disease after first line platinum containing
      polychemotherapy who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered to take part in
      the study.

      The patients may be pre-screened at the time of the 1st line chemotherapy.

      In order for patients to be enrolled, the investigator must have carried out a radiological
      assessment of the disease during first line systemic treatment (a maximum of between 3 and 6
      cycles): the cancer must be controlled. Patients with disease progression cannot be included
      in the PULSE study as this is a maintenance study.

      After inclusion, Avelumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg, at a frequency of once
      every 2 weeks with appropriate supportive care.

        cycles of carboplatin AUC5 is required to be eligible

          -  Patients without disease-progression according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria (i.e. in
             complete or partial response or stable disease at inclusion) after 3 to 6 cycles of

             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
