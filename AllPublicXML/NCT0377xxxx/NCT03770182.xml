    <measure>Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) - Corrected Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>month 3</time_frame>
    <description>CERAD stands for &quot;The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease&quot;. The CERAD was funded by the National Institute on Aging in 1986 to develop standardized, validated measures for the assessment of Alzheimer's disease (Fillenbaum 2008). CERAD is a cognitive test battery which is normalized for age, gender and education (Morris 1988). The CERAD total score (Chandler 2005) is a good measure for Alzheimer's Disease (Ehrensperger 2010, Rossetti 2010, Seo 2010, Hallikainen 2013).
The CERAD total score is a scale from 0 to 100 with 100 meaning &quot;normal cognitive ability&quot; and 0 meaning &quot;severe cognitive impairment&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive test. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) was designed to evaluate the severity of cognitive and noncognitive behavioral dysfunctions characteristic of persons with Alzheimer's disease (Rosen 1984). It consists of 21 items. Its sensitivity seems limited in mild AD (Irizarry 2008) but it is commonly used with AD intervention studies.
The ADAS total score (ADASUM) ranges from 0 to 120 and consists of two subscales, the ADAS-COG with 70 possible points and the ADAS-NonCog with 50 possible points. In both subscales and total scale 0 points means &quot;healthy&quot; and the highest score means &quot;severe impairment&quot;. The total score ADASUM is the sum of both subscales.
Its cognition subscale (ADAS-COG) is a standard tool in pivotal clinical trials to detect therapeutic efficacy in cognition (Robert 2010). The ADAS-COG includes 11 items assessing the several cognitive domains.</description>

    <measure>Forgetfulness assessment inventory (FAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>FAI stands for &quot;Forgetfulness Assessment Inventory&quot;. The Forgetfulness Assessment Inventory is a questionnaire. Kogler et al (2013) developed the forgetfulness assessment inventory FAI (German: Skala zur Erfassung der Gedächtnisleistung - SEG) to evaluate subjective complaints regarding everyday memory problems. Lehrner et al. (2014) validated the test. The FAI consists of 16 items to measure subjective memory problems in daily life based on a Likert scale.
The FAI focuses on the subjective evaluation of memory problems, particularly in relation to episodic memory, which has been found to be very sensitive in the early detection of mild cognitive impairment and AD (Lehrner 2014). This questionnaire is supposed to be completed by the patient as well as by a person familiar with the patient.
The total score ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores reflect poorer subjective functioning and greater complaints.</description>

    <description>The NPI stands for &quot;Neuropsychiatric Inventory&quot;. It is a questionnaire for care taker.
The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was developed to provide a means of assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychopathology of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders (Cummings 1997). Ten behavioral and two neurovegetative areas are included in the NPI.
The NPI is based on responses from an informed caregiver, preferably one living with the patient. A caregiver can be defined as a person spending at least 4 hours per day at least 4 days per week with the patient and who is knowledgeable about the patient's daytime and nighttime behaviors.
The total NPI score is the sum of all items. It varies from 0 to 120 for the behavioral domains and from 0 to 144 for all 12 domains.</description>
