      Observational study looking at barriers to care for individuals seeking care, Post Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PEP) after an actual or perceived exposure to HIV. Following PEP treatment
      subjects will be asked about there intent to transition to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
      and surveyed about barriers to care or perceptions of care

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the rate of engagement in a PEP to PrEP HIV
      provider network for those patients presenting following a non-occupational HIV exposure.

      The development of a referral network and intensive clinical follow up of PEP patients will
      result in more patients appropriately initiating PEP, being referred to appropriate follow
      up, and post exposure transition and maintaining on PrEP (if indicated) at completion of the
      PEP medications.
