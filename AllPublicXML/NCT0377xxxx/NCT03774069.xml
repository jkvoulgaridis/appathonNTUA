  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DreaMed Advisor Pro is a software which automatically analyses treatment information,
      learns patient's needs and accordingly suggests adjustments in insulin dosing. DreaMed
      Advisor Pro is a decision- support software intended for assisting healthcare professionals
      in the management of type 1 diabetes patients who use insulin pumps as their insulin delivery
      therapy and monitor their blood glucose levels using CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) or
      CGM and self-management blood glucose meter.

      The main objective of the proposed study is to test the safety, reliability, and efficacy of
      the DreaMed Advisor Pro algorithm when the recommendation is sent directly to the patient
      without a physician review.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group (DreaMed
      Advisor Pro) or control group (standard of care). Participants will download the CGM and pump
      data at no less frequent than every 4 weeks for both groups during the 3 months period of the
      study.

      Each time new data is received, the following actions will be performed:

      In the intervention group, a new algorithm recommendation for pump settings will be issued.
      The recommendation will be approved by a technical, non-physician to assure that glucose data
      are not fall within predefined safety criteria which require a physician approval before the
      recommendation will be sent to the patient, otherwise, recommendation will be sent directly
      to the patient.

      In the control group, if no safety criteria is met, it is the responsibility of the patient
      to contact his/her physician to advise on change of treatment. In case a safety issue has
      occured, the physician will contact the patient and change the pump settings.
