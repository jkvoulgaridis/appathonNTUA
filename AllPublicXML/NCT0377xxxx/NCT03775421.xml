  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this open-label (OL) trial is to study the long-term use of macitentan for up to 2
      years in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent patients beyond the 52 weeks of treatment in
      the parent RUBATO double-blind (DB) study (AC-055H301, NCT03153137). This OL trial studies
      the long-term effect of macitentan in Fontan-palliated patients as it is not known if the
      effect of macitentan is sustained beyond 52 weeks (end of the parent RUBATO DB study). In
      addition, the trial also studies the long-term safety of macitentan as this is also unknown.
      Furthermore, the opportunity will be given to patients who were on placebo in the parent
      RUBATO DB study to receive macitentan 10 mg and benefit from a potentially active treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is designed as an open-label (OL), single-arm, multicenter long-term trial in which all adolescent (â‰¥ 12 years) and adult male and female subjects who had previously completed in the parent RUBATO DB study (AC-055H301, NCT03153137) will enroll. The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of macitentan. All efficacy endpoints including the ones listed below are considered as exploratory in nature.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>From Enrollment to End-of-Study visit (Week 104 + 30 days safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs are captured up to 30 days after OL treatment discontinuation (End-of-Treatment visit). A treatment-emergent AE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study treatment (from OL treatment initiation until 30 days after OL treatment discontinuation) whether or not considered by the investigator as related to study treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>From Enrollment to End-of-Study visit (Week 104 + 30 days safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory abnormalities are laboratory values below of above the normal range. The definitions of marked abnormal values are based mainly on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).</description>
