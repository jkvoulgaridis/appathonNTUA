      Observation of the clinical use of the Emprint Microwave Ablation System for the ablation of
      Liver Metastases of Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.

      The CIRSE Emprint Microwave Ablation Registry (CIEMAR) aims to collect real-life data on the
      microwave ablation (MWA) of colorectal liver metastatic disease using the Emprint Microwave
      Ablation System.

      CIEMAR is a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre observational (non-interventional) study
      with the objective to observe the &quot;real-life&quot; use of MWA in Europe. The study will observe
      the use of the Emprint Microwave Ablation System and all patients included in CIEMAR will
      receive treatment with this device as their standard care for CRLM.

      Primary endpoint: local tumour control in liver at 12 months after the microwave ablation
      treatment on a per lesion basis

      Secondary objectives: Overall survival; Overall disease-free survival; Hepatic disease-free
      survival; Time to untreatable progression by thermal ablation; Systemic cancer therapy
      vacation; Quality of life; Adverse events and toxicity; Economic aspects

      In order to measure changes in the quality of life of enrolled patients at different moments
      in time before and after treatment with MWA, CIEMAR will incorporate the EORTC QLQ-C30
      questionnaire.

      Filling out the quality-of-life questionnaire is entirely voluntary for the patient. The
      patient will be offered to fill out the questionnaire in his/her mother tongue.

      The registry is currently in design and it is planned to start patient inclusion in January
      2020. The target is to enrol 1000 patients and patient enrolment will stop two years after
      the enrolment of the first patient. A follow-up period of three years has been defined by the
      CIEMAR Steering Committee.

    <description>Treatment specific quality of life will be assessed using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire which includes 28 questions on a scale of 1 to 4 where 1 indicates lower impact of the disease on the patient's quality of life and 4 represents a high impact. Additionally 2 questions using a scale form 1 to 7 are used to generally assess the patient's quality of life where 1 represents poor quality of life and 7 represents an excellent quality of life.</description>
