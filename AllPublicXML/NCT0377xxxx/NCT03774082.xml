  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm, Phase II multi-center study will enroll approximately 42
      subjects and investigate the activity, pharmacokinetics and safety of ruxolitinib added to
      the subject's immunosuppressive regimen among infants, children, and adolescents aged ≥28
      days to &lt;18 years old with either moderate to severe treatment-naive cGvHD or SR-cGvHD.
      Subjects will be grouped according to their age as follows: Group 1 includes subjects ≥12y to
      &lt;18y, Group 2 includes subjects ≥6y to &lt;12y, Group 3 includes subjects ≥2y to &lt;6y, and Group
      4 includes subjects ≥28days to &lt;2y.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects age ≥28 days and &lt;18 years at the time of informed consent.

          -  Subjects who have undergone alloSCT from any donor source (matched unrelated donor,
             sibling, haplo-identical) using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord
             blood. Recipients of myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning are eligible.

          -  Subjects with diagnosed moderate to severe cGvHD according to NIH 2014 Consensus
             Criteria (Section 16.2) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Other possible diagnoses for clinical
             symptoms supporting cGvHD diagnoses must be excluded (e.g., infection, drug side
             effects, malignancy). Subjects must be either:

               -  Treatment-naive cGvHD subjects that have not received any prior systemic
                  treatment for cGvHD except for a maximum 72h of prior systemic corticosteroid
                  therapy of methylprednisolone or equivalent after the onset of chronic GvHD.
                  Subjects are allowed to have received prior systemic treatment for cGvHD
                  prophylaxis (as long as the prophylaxis was started prior to the diagnosis of
                  cGvHD).

        OR o Steroid-refractory moderate to severe cGvHD as per institutional criteria, and still
        receiving systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of cGvHD for a duration of &lt;18 months
        prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. In case the corticosteroids were interrupted due to response, the
        duration of &lt; 18 months applies to the last period of corticosteroid use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  SR-cGvHD subjects with a prior cGvHD treatment with a JAK1- or a JAK2- or a
             JAK1/2-inhibitor, except when the subject achieved complete or partial response and
             has been off JAK inhibitor treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to Cycle Day 1 or up
             to 5 times the half-life of the prior JAK inhibitor, whichever is longer.

             * Subjects who initiated systemic calcineurin inhibitors (CNI; cyclosporine or
             tacrolimus) within 3 weeks prior to start of ruxolitinib on Cycle 1 Day 1. Note:
             systemic CNI are allowed when initiated &gt; 3 weeks from start of ruxolitinib.

          -  Failed prior alloSCT within the past 6 months

          -  Significant respiratory disease including subjects who are on mechanical ventilation
             or who have a resting oxygen saturation &lt; 90% by pulse-oximetry on room-air.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function (unrelated to GvHD) or GI disease
             (unrelated to GvHD) that may significantly alter the absorption of oral ruxolitinib
             (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption
             syndrome or small bowel resection),

          -  Cholestatic disorders, or unresolved sinusoidal obstructive syndrome/veno-occlusive
             disease of the liver (defined as persistent bilirubin abnormalities not attributable
             to cGvHD and ongoing organ dysfunction)

          -  Presence of clinically active uncontrolled infection including significant bacterial,
             fungal, viral or parasitic infection requiring treatment.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) based on
             assessment done by Investigator or delegate.

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications,
             excipients, or similar compounds.

          -  History of bone disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets, renal
             osteodystrophy, osteomyelitis, osteopenia, fibrous dysplasia, osteomalacia etc. prior
             to the underlying diagnosis which resulted in the alloSCT.

          -  History of endocrine or kidney related growth retardation prior to the underlying
             diagnosis which resulted in the alloSCT.

          -  Evidence of clinically active tuberculosis (clinical diagnosis per local practice)

          -  Any corticosteroid therapy for indications other than cGvHD at doses &gt; 1
             mg/kg/daymethylprednisolone (or equivalent prednisone dose 1.25 mg/kg/day) within 7
             days of the screening visit.

          -  History of progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (PML).

          -  Presence of severely impaired renal function
