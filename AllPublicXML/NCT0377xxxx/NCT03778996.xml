  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88, a combination metabolic cancer
      treatment, in two study cohorts:

        -  Clinically advanced Ewing's Sarcoma patients who have not progressed at the conclusion
           of systemic treatment

        -  Clinically advanced sarcoma patients in the salvage treatment setting

      Up to 24 efficacy evaluable patients (12 per cohort) will be enrolled. Study patients will
      receive oral SM-88, with scheduled safety and efficacy evaluations.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, two stage, pilot phase 2 trial evaluates the efficacy and
      safety of SM-88 in two cohorts of patients: 1) as maintenance therapy following standard
      primary or palliative treatments for Ewing's sarcoma patients with high risk of relapse or
      disease progression; and 2) as salvage therapy for patients with clinically advanced
      sarcomas.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of SM-88, a combination metabolic cancer
      treatment, measured as positive efficacy events, including overall response, maintaining
      stable disease for ≥ 3 months, or progression free survival at least 1.5 times longer than
      the last prior line of treatment.

      Eligible patients will receive daily oral treatment with SM-88, which consists of
      D,L-alpha-metyrosine, used with methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus in continuous treatment
      cycles of 28 days. Treatment will continue until: 1) Symptomatic, clinical progression with
      radiographic progressive disease; 2) 48 weeks after documented complete response; or 3)
      evidence of unacceptable toxicity, or other decision to discontinue treatment
