  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and mechanisms of change of two self-help
      books for college student mental health in a randomized controlled trial. One book is based
      on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and one is based on acceptance and commitment
      therapy (ACT).

      This study will test the following hypotheses:

        1. The ACT and MBSR books will both be feasible and acceptable with college students as
           evidenced by equivalently high satisfaction and engagement rates.

        2. The ACT and MBSR books will be equally effective in improving mental health and
           well-being among college students.

        3. The ACT book will produce larger improvements in valued action, and the MBSR book will
           produce larger improvements in mindfulness.

        4. Valued action will be a stronger predictor of improvements in mental health in the ACT
           condition and mindfulness will be a stronger predictor of improvements in the
           mindfulness condition.

      The investigators aim to recruit 150 college students for this RCT (75 per treatment
      condition). This will provide adequate power (0.80) to detect differences between groups of
      medium effect size (d=0.50). Note that detailed eligibility criteria are listed in the
      &quot;Eligibility&quot; section. Participants will be recruited via SONA (a participant recruitment
      system), flyers, online postings, classroom announcements, and through a general online
      screener for various Utah State University (USU) Contextual Behavioral Science (CBS) Lab
      studies.

      Total study participation will occur over approximately 8 weeks. all study procedures will be
      completed online, on a computer/mobile phone. After completing informed consent, participants
      will complete a baseline survey.

      At the end of the baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to use a book based
      on ACT (The Happiness Trap) or MBSR (A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook).
      Participants will be asked not to access other self-help books during the study duration.
      Participants will be provided with an 8-week reading schedule and a link to the assigned
      book. Participants will be asked to complete a mid-treatment survey 4 weeks after the
      beginning of treatment. The mid-treatment survey will include questions about adherence.
      Participants will be asked to complete a post-treatment survey 8 weeks after the beginning of
      treatment. This survey will also ask about adherence (reading, use of strategies taught in
      the book). Researcher contact will involve reminders to complete assessments, basic email
      assistance in identifying and responding to any barriers to using the self-help book, and
      twice-weekly reminders of the suggested reading schedule.

      After completing the initial assessment participants will be sent a link to The Happiness
      Trap if they are assigned to the ACT condition, or a link to the Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction Workbook if they are in the MBSR condition. They will be able to access the book
      online at any time. Participants will be asked to read assigned chapters on an 8-week
      schedule.

      The Happiness Trap is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a modern cognitive
      behavioral therapy that combines acceptance and mindfulness methods with values and behavior
      change methods. The primary treatment components in The Happiness Trap are psychoeducation of
      ACT, defusion, acceptance, mindfulness, self-as-context, value, behavioral commitment.

      A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook is based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction,
      a standardized approach to teaching mindfulness, primarily through meditation practices. The
      primary treatment components in A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook are
      psychoeducation about mindfulness and mindfulness meditation and various types of mindfulness
      meditation practice, such as mind-body connection, loving-kindness meditation, interpersonal
      mindfulness, and the healthy path of mindful eating, exercise, rest, and connection.

    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-treatment (4 weeks after baseline), and posttreatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) : a self-report measure of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Higher scores indicate higher negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. This measure assesses each of these symptoms as a distinct subscale. Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 &quot;did not apply to me at all&quot; to 3 &quot;applied to me very much, or most of the time.&quot; Ranges for depression, anxiety, and stress are 0-28, 0-20, and 0-33, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-treatment (4 weeks after baseline), and posttreatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of valued action. This is a 10-item measure, and each item is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all true&quot; to 6 &quot;completely true.&quot; The VQ is a new measure, but initial validation results indicate adequate reliability and validity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-treatment (4 weeks after baseline), and posttreatment (8 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of five facets of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, being nonjudgmental, and nonreactivity. The FFMQ is a 39-item questionnaire, and each FFMQ item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (&quot;never or very rarely true&quot;) to 5 (&quot;very often or always true&quot;). The FFMQ has been found to be a reliable and valid measure of mindfulness in past research.</description>
