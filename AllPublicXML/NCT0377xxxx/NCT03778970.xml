  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effects of an exercise program based on
      movement control exercises associated with self-management advice (SME) or pain neuroscience
      education (PNE) on the outcomes of pain intensity and pain disability in patients with
      chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: One hundred and four volunteers (104) aged 18-50 years with chronic
      non-specific low back pain.

      Interventions: The volunteers will be randomized into two treatment groups: self-management
      education and movement control exercises or pain neuroscience education and exercises based
      on movement control exercises. Two workshops of 40 minutes each will be administered as
      education approach and the exercise program along 2 months ( and 12 sessions distributed over
      2 months.

      Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes will include pain intensity and low back disability,
      and secondary outcomes will be pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, kinesiophobia,
      exercise adherence and global perceived effect. These will be measured pre- and
      post-intervention and at the 1-month follow-up. Statistical analysis will be conducted
      following treatment intent principles, and treatment effects will be calculated using a mixed
      linear model, considering intervention groups as a factor and assessments over time as
      repeated measures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity - Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS used to assess pain intensity in this trial will consist in a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10, in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. Previous research has found the NPRS to be responsive to change, with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 2.4 among patients with CLBP receiving exercise or education.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Low Back Pain Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Brazilian Portuguese version of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) will be used to assess low back pain related disability. This instrument consists of 10 items, each of which has six response options. The total score will be calculated by summing up all the points, with the largest possible sum being 50. This sum will be transformed into a percentage by multiplying it by two. Previous research has found that ODI showed responsiveness to change for patients with CLBP, with MCID of 8 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Validated and translated to Brazilian-Portuguese, the Pain Catastrophizing scale (Br-PCS) is a self-administered questionnaire that presents 13 questions, divided into 3 domains: helplessness, magnification, and rumination. The scale has 5 points: 0 (minimum); 1 (slight); 2 (moderate); 3 (intense); and 4 (very intense). The final score ranges from 0 to 52 points, with the psychological risk being directly proportional to higher scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Validated for Brazilian-Portuguese, the Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (PSE) presents 10 questions scored from 0 (Not at all confident) to 6 (Completely confident). The score achieved on this scale can range from 0 to 60, higher values reflecting stronger self-efficacy beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear Avoidance Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Validated and translated to Brazilian-Portuguese, the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ-Brazil) is composed of 16 self-report items, subdivided into the FABQ-Phys, addressing beliefs related to occupational activities, and the FABQ-Work, work-related beliefs. However, the FABQ-Work score should be measured by adding items 6,7,9,10,11,12, and 15 with a score ranging from 0 to 42 and the FABQ-Phys through the sum of items 2,3,4, and 5, with the score ranging from 0 to 24 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of following session, immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer the Brazilian Portuguese version of the scale cross-culturally adapted. The tool is comprised of 16 items, 6 items directly assessing behavior adherence (Section B), while 10 additional items related to non-adherence reasons (Section C). The 16 items were classified using an ordinal scale of 5 possible answers (0 = strongly agree to 4 = totally disagree) with a possible score range from 0 to 64. A higher overall adherence score indicated better adherence to exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after and at 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Perceived Effect Scale has the purpose of investigating musculoskeletal features, where the patient has the capacity to report improvement or deterioration over time, usually used to measure the effect of a therapy with the question: &quot;Compared to when this episode began, how would you describe your low back currently?&quot; Scored from -5 (much worse) to +5 (fully recovered), higher scores indicate improvement in the condition.</description>

    <description>The PNE will follow the principles established by Explain Pain, addressing reconceptualization of pain, emphasizing modern neuroscience concepts. The PNE workshop will last 40 minutes (2 sessions). The movement control exercises will consist of active exercises that address posture and control of movements which are impaired and trigger pain. The session will last approximately 30 minutes, starting with the execution of the coordination exercises in the control of movement with an intensity of 10 to 30 repetitions and then performing exercises for stretching in 3 series of 30 seconds. Finally, strengthening exercises in 3 sets of 15 repetitions will be implemented. The exercises will be administered 1 session/week (volunteers will be oriented to execute the same exercises at home twice a week). The volunteers will receive 8 sessions at the clinic.</description>

    <description>The Self-Management Education (SME) strategy will be aligned with the &quot;Back Book&quot; concepts, focused on behavior change and encouraging participants to be active despite of the pain. The SME workshop will last 40 minutes (2 sessions). The movement control exercises will consist of active exercises that address posture and control of movements which are impaired and trigger pain. The session will last approximately 30 minutes, starting with the execution of the coordination exercises in the control of movement with an intensity of 10 to 30 repetitions and then performing exercises for stretching in 3 series of 30 seconds.
