  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medullary carcinoma (MC) is a rare tumor with solid growth pattern without glandular
      differentiation and constitute less than 1% of colorectal cancer. Lymph node positivity and
      distant organ metastasis were reported to be lower than other poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinomas. Therefore, the diagnosis of MC is pathologically important in terms of
      follow-up and treatment. MC is commonly localized in the right colon, has a large tumor size,
      and is mostly diagnosed in the T4 stage. As MC most likely have defects in DNA MMR, the
      correct pathological diagnosis is important for the postoperative treatment and the prognosis
      of the patients.

      427 patients with colorectal cancer who were underwent surgery between January 2011 and
      December 2017, were evaluated retrospectively into 2 groups as MC (n:13) and non-MC (n:414)
      in terms of demographic characteristics, pathological data and oncological outcomes.
