    <textblock>
      Traditional school scoliosis screening approaches remains debatable due to unnecessary
      referal and excessive cost. Deep learning algorithms have proven to be powerful tools for the
      detection of multiple diseases; however, the application of such methods in scoliosis
      screening requires further assessment and validation. Here, the investigators develop an
      artificial system for the automated screening of scoliosis using disrobed back images, and
      conduct clinical trial to validate if the diagnostic system can offsetting the shortcomings
      of human doctors.
