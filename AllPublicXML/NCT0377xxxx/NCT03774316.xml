  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small proportion of intensive care unit patients receiving antifungals have a proven
      invasive fungal infection. However, antifungal treatment has side effects such as toxicity,
      emergence of resistance, and high cost. Moreover, empirical antifungal treatment is still a
      matter for debate in these patients. Our study aimed to determine the incidence, associated
      factors, and safety of de-escalation of antifungals in immunocompromised critically ill
      patients.

      This prospective observational study is conducted in 14 ICU, during a 6 months period. All
      immunocompromised patients hospitalized for &gt;5d and treated with antifungals for suspected or
      proven invasive candida infection will be included De-escalation is defined as a reduction in
      antifungal spectrum or stopping initial drugs within the 5 days following their initiation.
      The three antifungals considered in this study are from the narrowest to the widest spectrum:
      fluconazole, caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B.

      This is a prospective observational multicenter study, aiming to determine the incidence, and
      safety of antifungal de-escalation in immunocompromised patients, and also factors associated
