      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the magnetic compressive anastomosis has a
      better outcomes than traditional manual anastomosis on bilioenteric anastomosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bilioenteric anastomosis is one of the most common and difficult operations in
      Hepatobiliary Surgery. The traditional manual anastomosis has become one of the main
      prognosis factors because of the length of suture time, the difficulty of operation, the high
      incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture. Magnetic compressive anastomosis can realize
      the fast anastomosis, reduce the difficulty, and reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage
      and stricture. Currently, the majority of studies of magnetic compressive bilioenteric
      anastomosis are merely confined within clinical case report and single-center, small sample,
      retrospective study. This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. To evaluate
      the security, reliability and convince of magnetic compressive bilioenteric anastomosis
      versus traditional suture method on incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture between
      magnetic compressive anastomosis and traditional manual anastomosis among patients who need
      bilioenteric anastomosis operation. The study is to enroll about 200 patients and divide into
      Study Group (Group A: Magnetic compressive anastomosis) and Control Group (Group B:
      traditional manual anastomosis) as 1:1 ratio randomly by stratification factors. The
      incidence of anastomotic leakage and stricture, length of bilioenteric anastomosis time,
      value of serum bilirubin, length of discharge time of magnetic device and mean time of
      hospital stay will be evaluated. The patients will drop out of the study if adverse events
      happen, active request for dropping out, new-onset severe disease or death. The primary and
      secondary end point will be observed by regular follow-up.
