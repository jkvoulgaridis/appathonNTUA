  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether exercise can reduce treatment-related adverse effects in
      prostate cancer patients initiating androgen deprivation therapy. Half of recruited
      participants completed a 3-month exercise intervention, while the other half did not perform
      any supervised exercise. It was anticipated that exercise would have a positive effect on
      body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is routinely used as first-line treatment for locally
      advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. However, it is associated with many side effects
      such as increased fat mass and reduced skeletal muscle mass, cardiorespiratory fitness and
      metabolic health. Ultimately, these negative changes induced by ADT contribute to reduced
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study evaluates whether 3-months of exercise can
      mitigate treatment toxicity in prostate cancer patients initiating ADT.

      In a parallel groups, prospective, randomised controlled design, participants were randomly
      allocated to a standard care control group or standard care plus exercise group. The exercise
      group completed 3-months of combined aerobic and resistance training. The standard care group
      did not receive any supervised exercise or specific physical activity recommendations.
      Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3-month (post-intervention), and 6-month (follow-up)
      endpoints.

    <measure>Whole body fat mass (kg)</measure>
    <time_frame>Adjusted mean difference between groups at 3-month endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>Whole body fat mass was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and concurrent bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) with a single-frequency, phase-sensitive 50 kilohertz bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA-101, RJL/Akern Systems, Florence, Italy). This was chosen as the primary outcome because adiposity has shown a high propensity to increase during the initial phases of androgen deprivation therapy, more so than other measures (Galvao et al. 2011), which highlights the importance of targeting body fat at this stage of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Godin Leisure-Time Exercise questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Adjusted mean difference between groups at 3-month and 6-month endpoints</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise questionnaire was used to characterise levels of physical activity. The questionnaire contains three items and asks the patient to recall the number of bouts of strenuous, moderate, or mild physical activity that exceed 15 min in duration in which they have engaged in over a typical week. A total score is calculated by multiplying the number of strenuous, moderate, and mild physical activity bouts by weights of 9, 5, and 3, respectively, and summing those values in an overall score that ranges from 0 to 119 in arbitrary units. Higher scores indicate participation in higher levels of physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Number of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Descriptive statistics reported during the 3-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>The number of adverse events were recorded to determine the feasibility of the exercise intervention. An adverse event was defined as the occurrence of any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the exercise intervention. The type of adverse events was also noted.</description>

    <description>The number of exercise sessions completed by each participant in the intervention group was recorded. These values were than averaged to provide a measure of adherence. The maximum number of exercise sessions that participants could complete was 24, so adherence ranged from 0 to 24 sessions, with higher scores indicating greater adherence.</description>

    <description>The exercise was supervised by exercise science staff in the exercise science facilities at the University of East Anglia, UK. Participants competed two weekly sessions for 12 weeks upon initiating ADT. Each session lasted ~60 min and included aerobic interval exercise on a cycle ergometer (Monark 824E; Varberg, Sweden) followed by resistance training. In addition to the supervised exercise sessions, patients were advised on how to increase their habitual physical activity levels and were encouraged to engage in 30 minutes of self-directed exercise on three days each week (e.g. brisk walking, cycling, home-based resistance training).</description>
