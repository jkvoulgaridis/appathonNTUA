  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental Fear and Anxiety (DFA) are at higher levels among children and often leads to
      avoidance of dental treatment. Negative experiences in the early years such as experience of
      pain during injections, fillings, or extractions may lead to difficulties in treatment and
      behavior management among children. During dental procedures such as restorations and
      extractions injectable anesthetics are required as they are used to anesthetize and numb the
      area around the tooth receiving treatment. Topical anesthetics are used prior to using
      injectable anesthetic to alleviate some pain and discomfort. Topical anesthetics should be
      used with caution as they consist of more concentrated doses of pharmaceutical elements used
      in injectable anesthetics. Such high concentrations can result in increased gag reflux,
      central nervous system depression and cardiovascular effects in rare cases. With many recent
      advances in dental treatment, there is also a need for new non-pharmaceutical strategies to
      alleviate pain and discomfort among children which in turn will motivate children and their
      parents to visit the dental clinic more frequently. Electronic anesthesia or Synapse
      Transcutaneous Electronic Nerve Stimulation (TENS), a non-invasive device that uses low
      energy electrical stimulation to reduce pain perception, has gained acceptance since the
      1990s. Advantages of using the TENS device are that it is safe, easy to use, well-accepted
      among patients as evidenced in the few trials conducted so far, no adverse complications and
      has been successful in alleviating pain during dental procedures. This study aims to explore
      use of the TENS to alleviate pain and discomfort at the oral mucosal site where the patient
      will receive a local anesthetic injection. In this randomized case-crossover trial among
      children aged 6-14 years the effectiveness of Aleve TENS device in reducing pain and anxiety
      among children prior to receiving injectable local anesthetic agent during dental procedures
      is compared to those who receive the local anesthetic gel prior to receiving local anesthetic
      injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children between 6-14 years will be recruited at the Pediatric Oral Healthcare Center. A
      sample of 100 male and female children who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      recruited. Once parents' consent at the first visit basic demographic information, dental and
      medical history information is collected. This study is conducted in total of two clinic
      visits. In the first visit participants are randomized to either the intervention group or
      the comparison group. The intervention group receives the experimental device (TENS) prior to
      local anesthetic injection whereas the comparison group receives the local anesthetic gel.
      Following this the participants receive the local anesthetic injection after which treatment
      is completed. In the second visit the participants are crossed over to the other group and
      therefore randomization is not used for visit 2. Those who received the local anesthetic gel
      in visit 1 will receive the experimental device in visit 2 and those who received the
      experimental device in visit 1 will receive the local anesthetic gel in visit 2 . Following
      this treatment procedures are completed.

    <description>SYnapse TENS device will be used for alleviating pain through electrical stimulation. This is a battery powered device where an electrical current is applied intra-orally on the buccal and lingual sides using an intra-oral pad applicator. This device has been cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the prescribed electrical field falls almost a 10 factor level lower than routine pulp testing devices used in dentistry. The TENS device was previously tested in a pilot study with promising results. Chair side application and at-home use of the device by the patient was shown to drastically reduce pain and discomfort associated with orthodontic tooth movement.</description>

    <description>Topical anesthetic Gel is the active comparator in this study. The topical anesthesia (anesthetic gel) Centrix LolliCaine with 20% benzocaine in single package of 0.3 ml will be used. The amount of local anesthetic used will not exceed the maximum allowable dose, which will be calculated for each patient based on his/her age and weight prior to the dental procedure. This will be done based American Association of Pediatric Dentistry guidelines for the use of local anesthesia.</description>

    <intervention_name>Synapse TENS device</intervention_name>
    <description>At the time of local anesthetic application the TENS device will be activated and placed on the buccal and lingual alveolar mucosa adjacent to the tooth receiving the restorative treatment using the pad applicator. The tip of the device with the electrodes are placed in a vertical up and down motion for approximately ten seconds. Following this, the level of pain and anxiety are measured using the Wong Baker Scale and Visual Analog Scale. The TENS device is used for achieving localized pain relief at the site of local anesthetic injection prior to injecting the anesthetic agent (such as lidocaine or articaine). Following this, once the clinician ensures that the patient is pain free then local anesthetic injection is given and following that the dental procedures are conducted.</description>
