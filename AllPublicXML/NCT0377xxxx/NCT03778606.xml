  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile causes ~453,000 infections and ~29,300 deaths per year in the US,
      making it the most common hospital acquired infection in the country. C. difficile is an
      anaerobic bacterium that has the capacity to inhabit the colon of humans and other mammals.
      Initially thought to be a commensal, it was later found to be associated with antibiotic
      induced enterocolitis. Since then, it has gradually become one of the most important
      healthcare associated pathogens. C. difficile infection (CDI) causes colitis, which is
      inflammation of the colonic mucosa with a spectrum of severity from mild to more protracted
      diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, toxic megacolon, sepsis, and in some instances death.
      Mortality occurs despite the existence of three antibiotic options. CDI is also associated
      with higher hospital readmission rates, and associated healthcare costs in the US are
      estimated at 4.8 billion dollars annually. Due to the significance of C. difficile in
      healthcare, hospital level C. difficile rates are publically reported and closely scrutinized
      by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Standard infection control bundles are proving to
      be insufficient for controlling the national C. difficile problem. Better understanding of
      the biological steps preceding clinical infection and reversal of the underlying gut
      dysbiosis will allow us to curtail our C. difficile epidemic. The present study aims to
      manipulate the gut microbiota to halt the biological progression of C. difficile.

      CDI is a serious problem in hematology-oncology patients. The incidence of CDI in the
      hematology-oncology population is much higher than in other populations and
      hematology-oncology inpatient units frequently have the highest incidence of CDI cases within
      an institution. Additionally, hematology-oncology patients have high rates of C. difficile
      colonization upon hospitalization and more than 50% of patients detected with C. difficile
      colonization before bone marrow transplantation end up diagnosed with hospital associated
      CDI. This finding is not trivial as CDI treatment with oral vancomycin causes major and
      prolonged perturbations of their intestinal microbiota, which has been associated with higher
      mortality. In addition to the usual complications of CDI, a higher incidence of
      graft-versus-host-disease has been described in patients with CDI.

      Aim 1/Objective 1. Establish the feasibility of oligosaccharide supplementation and twice a
      week stool collections among 12 C. difficile colonized hematology-oncology inpatients. It
      will be determined if at least 70% of the oligosaccharide dosages are taken by at least 8
      (&gt;=66%) of the 12 enrolled patients. Additionally, the ability to collect at least 50% of the
      scheduled stool samples will be evaluated.

      Aim 1 will provide important information about the ideal food/drink to mix the potato starch
      supplemented in this study. The knowledge gained in this pilot will be used to design a
      future phase II or III clinical trial.

      Aim 2. Explore the impact of oligosaccharide supplementation on C. difficile loads and
      relative abundance of Firmicutes. All stool samples will undergo 16S ribosomal ribonucleic
      acid (rRNA) and bioinformatics at the MCW's Genomic and Precision Medicine Center and C.
      difficile quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at the PI's research laboratory.
      Historical controls will be obtained from a group of over 450 hematology-oncology inpatients
      who underwent at least one C. difficile surveillance test and whose stool samples are
      currently being processed for 16S rRNA by the PI's team. Controls at a 3:1 ratio with cases
      will be matched based on underlying disease, unit of admission, antibiotic use, baseline C.
      difficile fecal loads, and baseline relative abundance of Firmicutes.

      Objective 2a. Evaluate the impact of oligosaccharide supplementation on the change of C.
      difficile fecal loads when compared to historical controls.

      Objective 2b. Explore the effect of oligosaccharide supplementation on the change in relative
      abundance of Firmicutes when compared to historical controls.

      It is expected a reduction will occur in C. difficile fecal loads during oligosaccharide
      supplementation when compared to matched controls. Conversely, it is expected an increase in
      the relative abundance of Firmicutes (or some of its operational taxonomic units; OTUs)
      during oligosaccharide replacement will occur when compared to matched controls. The
      knowledge gained with Objectives 2a and 2b will be used to determine the sample size needed
      to design future phase II or phase III clinical trials.
