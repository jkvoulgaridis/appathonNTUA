  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to assess the effects of combining regular, generous intakes of
      high quality protein (with substantial amounts provided from whole eggs and egg whites) with
      calorie restriction on insulin resistance and weight loss (along with function, body
      composition, racial disparities, and a number of secondary outcomes) in black and white older
      adults with prediabetes who are participating in a 4-month intervention. The investigators
      will compare these effects to the same outcomes with a control group consuming a traditional
      control regimen of calorie restriction over the same duration.

      Older (&gt;60 yrs) men and women (50% African American, 50% white) who are obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2)
      and have pre-diabetes will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio; couples randomized together) to
      one to two treatment groups: 1) Weight loss intervention (WL-Control; n = 20): subjects
      follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss of ≥10%, protein~0.8g/g/d; and 2) High
      protein weight loss intervention (WL-Protein; n = 20): subjects follow a calorie-reduction
      diet for a weight loss of ≥10%, with a high proportion of high quality protein (&gt; 30g
      protein, 3/day, 60-70% egg protein). Primary (insulin resistance/sensitivity, weight loss)
      and secondary outcomes (physical function, body composition, diet adherence, cognitive
      function, readiness to change) will be measured at 0 and 4 months.
