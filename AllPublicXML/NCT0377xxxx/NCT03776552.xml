  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to compare the 4-month and 1-year effects of initial
      rapid weight loss and gradual weight loss (GWL), by using a low energy diet (LED) -program
      (intervention) or a standard GWL-program (control), respectively.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 286 participants will be randomized to either the LED-program; an 8-week LED
      (&lt;1000 kcal/day) - followed by an 8-week gradual increase in energy intake (4 weeks &lt;1300
      kcal/day and 4 weeks &lt;1500 kcal/day), or a 16-week standard GWL-course (controls). Thereafter
      all participants (both groups) will attend a comprehensive weight maintenance program the
      next 36 weeks

    <description>Generic questionnaire: Short Form-36 Health Survey, SF36. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores for each of the 8 domains and summary scores for physical and mental health will be calculated</description>

    <time_frame>4-month and 1-year</time_frame>
    <description>Obesity specific questionnaire: IWQOL-lite. The IWQOL-Lite is a 31-item measure of weight-related quality of life. There are five domain scores (Physical Function, Self-Esteem, Sexual Life, Public Distress and Work) and a total score. Scores for all domains and total score range from 0-100, with lower scores indicating greater impairment.</description>

    <description>Weight-related Symptom Measure (WRSM). The validated obesity specific WRSM measures 20 symptoms commonly related to being overweight or obese, including foot problems, joint pain, sensitivity to cold, shortness of breath, etc. using two different sets of items. The first set assesses whether or not a patient is experiencing specific symptoms, and the second set rates the level of the distress of the symptoms with values from zero (&quot;not at all&quot;) to six (&quot;bothers a very great deal&quot;). The first set creates an additive scale summing symptoms from 0-20, while the second forms a symptom distress scale ranging from 0-120.</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The validated generic HADS measures symptoms of anxiety and depression using 14 items scored from 0-3 It is decomposed into two domains measuring depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A), both consisting of seven items yielding a score from 0-21.</description>

    <measure>Changes in eating behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>4-month and 1-year</time_frame>
    <description>The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire -R 21 (TFEQ-R21) measures eating behaviour and has been validated for use in individuals with obesity and will be used in the study. It consists of 21 items comprising three domain scores; (1) uncontrolled eating; assessing the tendency to lose control over eating when feeling hungry or when exposed to external stimuli, (2) cognitive restraint; assessing the conscious restriction of food intake to control body weight or body shape, and (3) emotional eating; assessing overeating related to negative mood states. The domain scores were transformed to 0-100 scales to facilitate comparison; a higher score indicates more uncontrolled, restraint, or emotional eating.</description>
