  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      combination treatment of AZD5363 + Olaparib + Durvalumab and to determine the RP2D in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine if combination treatment of drugs, Olaparib,
      AZD5363 and Durvalumab has beneficial effects in advanced or metastatic cancers and to
      determine the effects it has on patients and their cancer.

      Primary Objectives

      â€¢ To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination treatment AZD5363 + Olaparib +
      Durvalumab and determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs),
      and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor
      malignancies.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics (PDn) of combination treatment AZD5363 + Olaparib +
           Durvalumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies

        -  To describe anti-tumor response using immune RECIST of combination treatment AZD5363 +
           Olaparib + Durvalumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To evaluate anti-tumour response using RECIST v1.1 for combination treatment AZD5363 +
           Olaparib + Durvalumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies

        -  To explore molecular correlates of the relationship between mutations in Akt/
           PIK3CA/PTEN pathway and response to AZD5363 +Olaparib+ Durvalumab

        -  To understand the role of tumour microenvironment in regulation of intratumoral immune
           regulators (i.e. T-regulatory cells) in improving response to Durvalumab

        -  To understand the role of AZD5363 as an immunomodulator

        -  To evaluate the role of PD-1 and PDL-1 immunohistochemical and tumour MMR status in
           predicting response to immune check point inhibitors.

      This study is divided into 3 different periods: Screening, Treatment, and End of Treatment
      Before taking the treatment, patients will have some tests and procedures done to make sure
      they are eligible for the study (Screening). Then they will enter the Treatment period, where
      Durvalumab, Olaparib and AZD5363 will be administered to them. If they stop taking your study
      medication for any reason, an End of Treatment visit will be conducted within 30 days after
      the last doze of study medication.

             slides) where such samples exist in a quantity sufficient to allow for analysis

          5. Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens will be allowed and may include biologics

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1;

          7. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function and organ function within 2 weeks of
             study treatment;

               -  Adequate hematologic function defined as:

                  (i) platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L in dose escalation phase, (ii) hemoglobin &gt;= 6.21
                  mmol/L or 10 g/dL, (iii) ANC &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L, (iv) WBC &gt;= 3.0 x 109/L. Up to 5%

               -  Hepatic function: bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT and
                  AST &lt; 2.5 times ULN. For patients with hepatic metastasis ALT and AST &lt; 5 times
                  ULN is permitted. Up to 10% deviation is acceptable.

               -  Normal TSH and ACTH

          8. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non sterilized male
             partner must use at least 2 highly effective method of contraception from the time of
             screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the
             last dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose
             of durvalumab monotherapy. Non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use
             male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after
             this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is
             an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female subjects should
             also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period. Acceptable methods of
             contraception are as below:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

               -  Male partner sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate).

               -  True abstinence

               -  It is not known whether AZD5363 has the capacity to affect the metabolism of
                  hormonal contraceptives, so hormonal contraception should also be combined with a
                  barrier method of contraception or patients must have evidence of
                  non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at
                  screening:

                    -  Post-menopausal: defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at
                       least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

                    -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy,
                       bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy, but not tubal ligation

          9. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or 90 days
             after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual
             activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method,
             and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients
             are required to use barrier methods of contraception and refrain from sperm donation
             throughout the study and for 180 days after the last dose of study drug. Male patients
             wishing to father children should be advised to arrange for freezing of sperm samples
             prior to the start of study treatment. Breastfeeding women are also excluded from
             study entry.

         10. At time of registration, if the patient has had previous treatment it must have been
             at least 4 weeks since major surgery or radiation therapy; four weeks from any other
             previous anti-cancer therapy including biologics. Patients must have recovered from
             their treatment-related events to &lt;=G1 with the exception of alopecia and neuropathy
             (&lt;= G2 sufficient).

         11. Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks

         12. Patients must weigh at least 30kg

         13. Patients previously treated on check point inhibitor or PARP inhibitor monotherapy
             will be allowed on study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant medical illness that in the investigator's opinion cannot be
             adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the patient's
             ability to tolerate this therapy;

          2. Radiation (except planned or ongoing palliative radiation to bone outside of the
             region of measurable disease) &lt;= 3 weeks prior to starting first dose of study
             medication

          3. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product (IP) within 30
             days of the first dose of AZD5363 or matching placebo.Treatment with any of the
