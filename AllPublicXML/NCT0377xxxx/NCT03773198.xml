  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for a surgical procedure may cause a patient to experience reactive anxiety. This
      reaction is appropriate if it is of low to moderate intensity. On the other hand, various
      studies have shown that postoperative awakening is more complicated if the patient
      experiences major preoperative anxiety. Thus, reducing anxiety could be a tool for preventing
      chronic pain.

      For several years now, the investigator's facility has been implementing Energy Resonance
      through Cutaneous Stimulation (ERCS), a method based on &quot;listening&quot; to the body's vibrations
      through the fingers on points based on the mapping of meridians in Chinese medicine.

      ERCS practitioners have noted the benefits of this method, particularly in soothing patients.
      It therefore seems necessary to detect and manage this anxiety beforehand and ERCS seems
      appropriate in this situation.
