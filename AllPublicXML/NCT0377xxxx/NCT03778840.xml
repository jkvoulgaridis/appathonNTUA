  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab is a very effective drug used to treat many inflammatory diseases. These diseases
      include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and systemic autoimmune
      diseases.

      The major drawback of this drug is the risk of infection, which are favored by the direct
      effect of rituximab on the immune system. The risk of infection is one of the major reason
      not to prescribe or withdraw rituximab in several patients. However, many questions remain
      unanswered regarding the proportion and risk factors of infection or immunodeficiency induced
      by rituximab. Better understanding of these issues will help prescribing rituximab and
      properly monitor patients during their treatment. Moreover, as treatment with substitutive
      immunoglobulins might be a solution to decrease the risk of infections in those patients, it
      is very important to better characterize the risk and risk factors of rituximab-associated
      infection. The present study aims to answer these questions.
