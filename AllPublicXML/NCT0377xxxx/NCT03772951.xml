    <textblock>
      The study group received antipsychotic drugs combined with Computerized Cognitive Remediation
      Therapy (CCRT) for 4 times/week for 45 minutes each time. The control group only received
      antipsychotic drugs. For a total of 12 weeks. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and
      Tropomyosin-related kinase B (Trk B) genes in peripheral blood were detected in both groups
      before and after treatment. Clinical symptoms and executive function assessment were
      performed in both groups before and after treatment. The relevance of genes and their effects
      on downstream protein expression levels led to a molecular genetic mechanism for the efficacy
      of Computerized Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CCRT) .

      Among the cognitive disorders of chronic schizophrenia, the most reported is the executive
      dysfunction of the prefrontal lobe. There is increasing evidence that Computerized Cognitive
      Remediation Therapy (CCRT) has a significant improvement in the implementation of
      schizophrenia, but the specific mechanism is unknown. Therefore, this study plans to select
      154 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized for a long time. They were
      randomly divided into two groups. The study group received antipsychotic drugs combined with
      Computerized Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CCRT) for 4 times/week for 45 minutes each time.
      The control group only received antipsychotic drugs. For a total of 12 weeks. brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B(TRK-B) genes in peripheral blood
      were detected in both groups before and after treatment. Clinical symptoms and executive
      function assessment were performed in both groups before and after treatment. The relevance
      of genes and their effects on downstream protein expression levels led to a molecular genetic
      mechanism for the efficacy of Computerized Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CCRT).
