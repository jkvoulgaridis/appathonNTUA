    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of 3 parts; Phase 1 Maximum Tolerated Dose, Phase 1 extended cohort
      and Phase 2a.

      For Phase 1, those who have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL) of B-cell Origin of any subtype will be considered eligible for enrolment.
      Each cycle last approximately 28 days.

      Once the dose of MG4101 is determined from Phase 1, Phase 2a will commence whereby two
      subgroups of patients will be enrolled and will similarly receive up to 6 cycles of treatment
      with the recommended Phase 2a dose of MG4101. The 2 subgroups are patients with indolent and
      aggressive NHL of B-cell origin respectively.
