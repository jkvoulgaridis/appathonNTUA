      by PT027 compared with PT007 and PT008 administered separately.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, 3-way cross-over study in healthy male and female
      participants, performed at a single study centre. A total of 90 healthy male or female
      participants will be randomized in this study to ensure that at least 81 participants are
      evaluable.

      The study will comprise:

      A screening period of maximum 27 days; Three treatment periods during which participants will
      be resident from the morning before dosing with Budesonide/Albuterol Sulfate metered dose
      inhaler (BDA MDI), Budesonide metered dose inhaler (BD MDI), and Albuterol Sulfate metered
      dose inhaler (AS MDI [Day -1]) until at least 24 hours after dosing; discharged on the
      morning of Day 2; and A final visit within 5 to 7 days after the last administration of BDA
      MDI, BD MDI, or AS MDI.

      There will be a minimum washout period of 7 days between each dose administration.
