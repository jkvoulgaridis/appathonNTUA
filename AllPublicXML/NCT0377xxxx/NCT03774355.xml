  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this open-label, randomized, 2*2 crossover study is to compare the safety
      and Pharmacokinetics CG1801 and CGL1802 in Healthy Volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (crossover) of
      CGL1802(Polmacoxib 2mg Tablet) and CG1801(Polmacoxib 2mg capsule) Every time before and after
      each medication, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and safety of CGL1802 and CG1801 is
      performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests (vital signs, physical exam, ECG,
      laboratory test, etc.) respectively.
