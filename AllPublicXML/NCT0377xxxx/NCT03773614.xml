  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairing drugs and alcohol are major risk factors for traumatic injuries. Still there is to
      date little knowledge to what extent these factors affect the epidemiology of trauma.
      Detailed mapping of risk factors improve targeting and efficiency of primary injury
      prevention. The aim of this project is therefore to facilitate injury prevention through
      improved data collection and analysis on impairing drugs and alcohol as a contributing and
      modifiable factor in injury morbidity and mortality.

      Study question: What is the toxicological profile among patients with suspected severe
      traumatic injury? Study design: a prospective population-based and national observational
      study will analyse toxicology from blood samples of all trauma admission during a 12 month
      study period.
