      LC-FAOD Conditions and Glut1 DS: Available through Intermediate-Size Population Expanded
      Access.

      The intermediate-size expanded access treatment protocol is intended to provide rapid access
      to triheptanoin for the treatment of seriously ill patients with long-chain fatty acid
      oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) or Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS).

      Patients will be treated under this protocol for the duration of one year, with consideration
      on a yearly basis for extension of treatment based on the risk-benefit ratio assessed in the
      Treating Physician's quarterly progress reports. Patients may continue to receive
      triheptanoin under this intermediate-size treatment protocol until commercial availability of
      triheptanoin, should the drug receive regulatory approval for the specific disease
      indication.

      Non-FAOD Conditions: Available through Single Patient Expanded Access. Expanded access may
      provide access for treatment prior to approval by the local regulatory agency.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Criteria per Intermediate-Size Population Protocol for LC-FAOD

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of LC-FAOD including: carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I or CPT
             II) deficiency, very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, long chain
             3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, trifunctional protein (TFP)
             deficiency, or carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency. Information on
             diagnosis will be obtained from medical records and should include confirmed diagnosis
             by results of acylcarnitine profiles, fatty acid oxidation probe studies in cultured
             fibroblasts, and/or mutation analysis.

          -  Patients of any age who are seriously ill experiencing clinical decompensation due to
             LC-FAOD despite other management, who may require intensive care (ICU, PICU, NICU).

          -  Fetuses with known pathogenic mutations on prenatal testing that are associated with
             high infant mortality may also be considered in advance of treatment that initiates
             after birth.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment, including visits and
             tests specified by the Treating Physician, documentation of symptoms and diet, and
             administration of triheptanoin. If a minor, have a caregiver(s) willing and able to
             assist in all applicable treatment requirements.

          -  Provide written informed consent (patients aged ≥ 18 years), or provide written assent
             (where appropriate) and have a legally authorized representative willing and able to
             provide written informed consent, after the nature of the treatment program has been
             explained and prior to any treatment-related procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Criteria per Intermediate-Size Population Protocol for Glut1 DS

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of Glut1 DS by documented SLC2A1 mutation or documented
             improvement on other forms of tripheptanoin administered based on a clinical
             presentation consistent with Glut1 DS diagnosis, including cerebrospinal fluid glucose
             levels.

          -  Patients of any age who are seriously ill and, in the Treating Physician's opinion,
             experiencing clinical manifestations of Glut1 DS despite other management.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment, including visits and
             tests specified by the Treating Physician, documentation of symptoms and diet, and
             administration of triheptanoin. If a minor, have a caregiver(s) willing and able to
             assist in all applicable treatment requirements.

          -  Provide written informed consent (patients aged ≥ 18 years), or provide written assent
             (where appropriate) and have a legally authorized representative willing and able to

             explained and prior to any treatment-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Criteria per Intermediate-Size Population Protocol for LC-FAOD

          -  Diagnosis of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, short- or
             medium-chain FAOD, ketone body metabolism defect, propionic acidemia or methylmalonic
             acidemia.

          -  Patient qualifies for any other clinical trial designed to progressively evaluate the
             safety and efficacy of triheptanoin in LC-FAOD.

          -  Any known hypersensitivity to triheptanoin that, in the judgment of the Treating
             Physician, places the patient at increased risk for adverse effects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Criteria per Intermediate-Size Population Protocol for Glut1 DS

          -  Patient qualifies for any other clinical trial designed to progressively evaluate the
