    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of durvalumab in combination with radiochemotherapy
      (FOLFOX and IMRT) and then as maintenance therapy for treating patients with localised
      unresectable oesophageal cancer. This is a randomized, French national, multicentre,
      comparative phase II trial

      ARION study will randomize 120 patients, in 12 centers in France, according to a ratio 1:1 in
      the following arm of treatment:

      - Standard and experimental arm:

      Definitive modulated-intensity radiotherapy will be delivered according to boost integrated
      technique 5 days a week for 5 weeks at a dose of:

        -  50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions to the macroscopic disease (endoscopic, TDM and fused
           FDG PET)

        -  45 Gy to the adjacent peri tumoral mucosis and prophylactic lymph node

      FOLFOX 4 simplified protocol, 1 infusion every 2 weeks (q2w) during 3 months starting with
      radiotherapy (+/- 1 day):

        -  IV oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² in 2 h on day 1 (D1)

        -  IV Leucovorin 200 mg/m² in 2 h on D1, followed by

        -  IV 5-FU 400 mg/m² in 10 minutes on D1 followed by

        -  IV continuous infusion 5-FU 2400 mg/m² in 46 h

        -  Experimental arm: Concomitant administration of durvalumab:
