  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa (proof of concept), randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicentre clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily PBF-677 oral
      treatment during 28 days in Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who are not receiving
      immunosuppressants and present mild-to-moderate activity of the disease. Enrolled patients
      would receive standard high doses of 5-ASA (4g), according to current clinical guidelines,
      and are randomized to receive also PBF-677 or placebo.

      This Proof-of-concept clinical trial is carefully designed to establish the safety profile of
      PBF-677 over 28 days in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis population and explore the
      relationship between the 200 mg PBF-677 dose and induction of remission, according to
      clinical parameters (Partial Mayo Score) and a faecal surrogate biomarker of mucosal
      inflammation (Calprotectin). The trial also will explore the PBF-677 pharmacokinetics (PK)
      profile during 28 days of administration.

      This small-scale study has been designed to detect a signal that PBF-677 is safe and active
      on decreasing levels of faecal calprotectin, as well as preliminary evidence of ameliorate
      the Partial Mayo Clinical Score in colitis patients who are in flare of the disease.

      The Population Under Study will be: Around 30 subjects. Adults (18-75 years old)
      non-immunosuppressed patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis disease.
