      Subjects will receive up to 4 study treatments with the PicoWay™ 730 nm laser wavelength,
      PicoWay™1064nm fractional handpiece and/or PicoWay™ 1064nm fractional handpiece for treatment
      of benign pigmented lesions or wrinkles. Subjects will return for three follow-up visit
      evaluations 1-month, 2-months and 3-months post final study treatment. Primary efficacy
      assessed by masked photographic evaluation. Optional biopsy collection for histological
      analysis of laser tissue effects.
