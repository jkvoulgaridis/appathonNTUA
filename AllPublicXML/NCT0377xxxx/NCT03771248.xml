      Dentistry is a rapidly progressing field with innumerable advances taking place on a day to
      day basis. The application of newer technologies and materials has advanced the specialty of
      prosthodontics and the services rendered to the patients.

      Taking into consideration that PEEK as a material wasn't clinically investigated to be used
      as a material for routine use, however PEEK in removable partial dentures will help in making
      many steps easier and reach patients demands regarding esthetics. Also, owing to the superior
      mechanical and biological properties of PEEK, it will not be surprising if dentures
      constructed from the polymer are routinely constructed in near future.

      On fabrication of telescopic removable partial denture, choosing the material is a major step
      in the success of the treatment. There are different aspects that should be taken into
      consideration while choosing it. Beginning with retention as it is a crucial aspect. The
      retention of the telescopic partial denture is gained from the friction between the primary
      and secondary crowns. The chosen material should be able to maintain this type of retention
      for the longest possible period.

      The esthetics also affects the treatment choice and patients preference, patients would
      choose metal free restorations over the ones that display metal. Finally the load
      distribution between the residual ridge and abutment should be equalized and transmitted in a
      favorable way. Otherwise one of the following consequences will occur; either overload on the
      abutment teeth followed by bone loss and abutment mobility or this overload is on the
      residual ridge leading to fast, progressive bone loss.

      Cobalt chromium that is used for fabricating the telescopic removable partial denture is
      considered that most suitable material up till this moment. However, it doesn't fulfill much
      of the previous points.

      As there will always be a continued improvement of materials and techniques used in dentistry
      especially in prosthodontics, innovative techniques must be regarded as potential
      alternatives to traditional materials.

      PEEK is from the innovative materials that has shown promising results in different branches.
      However, to date no clinical studies or systematic reviews focusing on the use of PEEK
      dentures have been published, therefore more investigations are needed in this field.
