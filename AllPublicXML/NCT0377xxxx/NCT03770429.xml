  <brief_summary>

      This research study is studying a research drug called AZD6738 as a possible treatment for
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an
      investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD6738 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      AZD6738 is a a drug being studied as a potential treatment for individuals with
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia. It targets a specific pathway in
      cells that repairs damage to DNA, specifically by blocking a protein called ATR. ATR notices
      when there is injury to DNA, which is the blueprint that allows cells to function and
      replicate, and works to repair that damage. Studies done in a laboratory setting and cell
      lines suggest that MDS and CMML cells rely specifically on the ATR pathway to fix DNA damage
      and survive; by inhibiting ATR with AZD6738, MDS or CMML cells appear to selectively
      accumulate DNA damage and die, but healthy cells appear to be less sensitive to this target.
      This suggests that inhibiting ATR may be a way to selectively target MDS or CMML cells.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to first investigate the safety and
      tolerability of AZD6738. The investigators will also evaluate whether AZD6738 has any effect
      on tumor growth, measure the activity of AZD6738 in the bone marrow, and study how AZD6738 is
      cleared by the body.

             cell transplantation at the time of enrollment.

          -  The effects of AZD6738 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because agents that inhibit ATR may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential
             and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation,

                  to start of dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of
                  non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at
                  screening:

                    -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at
                       least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

                       luteinizing hormone (LH) and plasma oestradiol levels in the postmenopausal
                       range for the institution.

               -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate
                  contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and
                  for 1 week after the last study drug administration. Sexually active male
                  patients must be willing to use barrier contraception i.e., condoms with all
                  sexual partners. Where the sexual partner is a 'woman of child-bearing potential'
                  who is not using effective contraception, men must use a condom (with spermicide)
                  during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of a study drug.

          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.

             study drug.

          -  Participants who, with the exception of alopecia, have not recovered from any adverse
             events ≥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2, unless those

                  and the Overall PI. Note these include common azole antifungals, macrolide
                  antibiotics, and other medications listed in the concomitant medications section.
                  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be
                  counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new
                  medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new
                  over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.

               -  Exposure of other drugs metabolised by CYP3A4 and/or CYP2B6 may be reduced and
                  additional monitoring may be required (see Appendix G).

               -  The use of herbal supplements or 'folk remedies' (and medications and foods that

             bowel disease, unstable respiratory or cardiac conditions, unstable angina pectoris,
             unstable cardiac arrhythmia, active bleeding diathesis (e.g. haemophilia or von
             Willebrand disease), uncontrolled seizures, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months:

               -  Unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction.

               -  Congestive heart failure (NYHA ≥ Class 2) or known reduced LVEF &lt; 50%.

               -  Unstable conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication e.g.
                  third-degree heart block.

               -  Unstable ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias (patients with chronic
                  controlled atrial arrhythmias in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are
                  eligible).

               -  Symptomatic carotid stenosis, TIA, haemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke.

               -  Cardiac procedures such as CABG, angioplasty or vascular stenting within 6 months
                  of dosing.

          -  Patients with relative hypotension (&lt;90/60 mmHg) or clinically relevant orthostatic
             hypotension, including fall in blood pressure of &gt; 20 mm Hg.

          -  Resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec for females and &gt;450 for males
             (Fredericia formula). Patients with known factors that increase the risk of QTc
             prolongation such as a personal/immediate family history of long QT syndrome are
             ineligible.

          -  Active untreated or concurrent malignancy that is distinct in primary site or
             histology, excluding: non-melanoma skin cancer, noninvasive colonic polyps,
             superficial bladder tumors, cervical cancer in-situ, ductal carcinoma in situ of the
             breast, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
             significance. Patients may be receiving maintenance hormonal therapy for prior breast
             or prostate cancer. Other malignancies that were treated with curative intent at least
             3 years prior to study screening and without evidence of active disease will be
             allowed.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control.
             Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD6738 is chemotherapy agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with AZD6738, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.

          -  HIV-positive participants, including those on combination antiretroviral therapy, are
             ineligible, both because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             AZD6738, as well as an increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Screening for patients without suspected disease is not
             required. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who are known to have active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C based
             on serologic status. Screening for patients without suspected disease is not required.
             Patients treated with viral suppression are eligible.

          -  Patients who have been vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of
             first dose of study drug.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or previous
             significant bowel resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude
             adequate absorption of AZD6738
