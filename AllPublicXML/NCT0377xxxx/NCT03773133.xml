    <textblock>
      This study consists of two phases. The phase I study is designed to investigate the safety
      and tolerability of Satoreotide tetraxetan following fractionated i.v. administrations in
      pre-treated subjects with locally advanced or metastatic cancers expressing sstr2 as
      identified by Satoreotide trizoxetan Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) scans. This phase
      will encompass both radioactivity escalation and peptide mass dose evaluation. Phase II will
      assess the efficacy of Satoreotide tetraxetan in subjects in selected indications, in a
      basket design.
