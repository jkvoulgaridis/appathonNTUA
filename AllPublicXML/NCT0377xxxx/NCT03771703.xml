      Objectives This study aims to describe sex specific differences of the hemodialysis
      population in Austria, to quantify sex specific differences in treatment and outcomes in
      hospitalized patients with chronic kidney disease and to examine decision making by doctors
      and patients with regards to hemodialysis initiation.

      To adequately serve the needs of these research questions, the study is divided into 3 parts
      (sub-studies).

        1. Description and analysis of sex-specific differences in hemodialysis patients and the
           associated male-to-female mortality in Austria.

        2. Description and analysis of sex-specific differences in treatment and outcomes in
           hospitalized patients with chronic kidney disease.

        3. Descriptive analysis of decision-making by doctors and patients with regard to
           hemodialysis initiation.

      2.1 Description and analysis of sex-specific differences in hemodialysis patients and the
      associated male-to-female mortality in Austria

      Hypothesis:

      There are sex-specific differences in hemodialysis incidence/prevalence and mortality among
      hemodialysis patients in Austria.

      There are differences in male-to-female mortality among hemodialysis patients as compared to
      the general population in Austria.

      Methodology:

      Data extraction will be performed from the Austrian Dialysis registry which holds complete
      longitudinal entries of all Austrian hemodialysis patients since 197040 and contains data of
      all patients undergoing hemodialysis in Austria since the year 1965.

      Demographic data, laboratory values, clinical characteristics and hemodialysis specific data
      will be collected for every patient registered in the Austrian Dialysis registry between 1865
      and 2015.

      Male and female population structure and mortality data of the Austrian general population
      will be retrieved from the ´Statistik Austria´ registry

      Statistics:

      Standard descriptive statistics will be used for tabulations of patient characteristics by
      sex and decade, of the Austrian hemodialysis population versus general population by sex and
      age group over time. The unadjusted male-to-female mortality rate ratio in the hemodialysis
      population will be compared with that of the Austrian general population. Adjusted hazard
      ratios for the male-to-female mortality risk in hemodialysis patients, by region will be
      performed using Cox regression analysis. Statistical modeling will closely follow a
      previously published study of hemodialysis data, analyzed by sex and country/region.4 All
      obtained p-values will be considered exploratory in nature.

      2.2 Description and analysis of sex-specific differences in treatment and outcomes in
      patients with chronic kidney disease.

      Hypothesis:

      There are sex-specific differences in treatment, length of hospitalization, mortality and
      dialysis initiation in patients with chronic kidney disease admitted to internal medicine
      wards.

      Methodology:

      Patients hospitalized at internal medicine wards of the Krankenanstaltsverbund (KAV) between
      Jan 1st 2015 and Dec 31st 2015 with eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m will be included.

      Primary study endpoints are length of hospital stay, death within hospitalization and
      dialysis initiation. Secondary endpoints are renal function parameters (eGFR, serum
      creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) and proteinuria during hospital stay. Laboratory data will
      be extracted from the KAV laboratory database and patient characteristics will be derived
      from the KAV patient management database.

      Statistics:

      Descriptive statistics will be used for presentation of demographic and clinical patient
      characteristics and prevalence of chronic kidney disease in women as compared to men.

      Further statistical methods will be chosen according to data availability and quality: The
      present plans include logistic regression to calculate the male-to-female odds of reaching
      one of the endpoints, conditional logistic regression for pair-matched data or logistic
      regression with propensity scoring.

      2.3 Descriptive analysis of decision-making by doctors and patients with regards to renal
      replacement therapy initiation

      Hypothesis

      There are sex-specific differences in decision-making of doctors and patients with end-stage
      renal disease with regards to renal replacement therapy initiation.

      Methodology

      Questionnaires will be sent to every Austrian chronic kidney disease outpatient clinic
      willing to participate. Doctors and patients will complete the questionnaire anonymously and
      questionnaires will be sent back after a 3 months-time period of data collection
      /questionnaire completion.

      The following questions will be included in the questionnaire:

      Doctor level:

      In your chronic kidney disease clinic

        1. How many men (a) and how many women (b) were registered in the year 2016?

        2. According to the first lab result that was taken in 2016, how many men (a) and how many
           women (b) were in chronic kidney disease stage 4, 3a, 3b, and 2?

        3. How many times did the registered men (a) and the registered women (b) have their labs
           checked and saw the doctor during the year 2016? Please subdivide also by chronic kidney
           disease stage.

        4. How many men (a) and how many women (b) have you informed they will likely need renal
           replacement therapy (RRT) in the next 12 months?

        5. How many men (a) and how many women (b) already have a fistula, and how many have a
           graft for vascular access?

        6. How many men (a) and how many women (b) have you informed about pre-emptive
           transplantation as an option for RRT?

        7. How many men (a) and how many women (b) have you informed about peritoneal dialysis as
           an option for RRT?

        8. How many men (a) and how many women (b) have you informed about hemodialysis as an
           option for RRT?

        9. How many men (a) and how many women (b) ended up on RRT (HD, PD or preemptive
           transplantation) during the year 2016?

       10. How many men (a) and how many women (b) did you consider end stage and thus in need of
           undergoing RRT in 2016?

       11. How many men (a) and how many women (b) refused RRT in 2016 despite your advice?

       12. Among those whom you considered end stage in the year 2016, in how many men (a) and how
           many women (b) was the decision to withhold or not do RRT mutual (taken by doctor and
           patient together)?

       13. How many men (a) and how many women (b) started RRT in 2016 against your advice?

       14. How would you judge your own decision making regarding RRT initiation

             1. Influenced by patient sex, with men more likely to start RRT

             2. Influenced by patient sex, with women more likely to start RRT

             3. Not influenced by patient sex

      To obtain adequate data, a reimbursement based on the number of patients seen by the center
      will be offered to the medical director of the outpatient clinic in December 2016. A specific
      plan on how to arrive at answering the questions correctly must be submitted; in principle,
      this plan should encompass several meetings with the outpatient clinic doctors in early 2017,
      in order to obtain an answer from all of them together (only question 14 must be individually
      answered).

      nausea/vomiting (a), fatigue/tiredness (b), edema (c), dyspnea (d).

      17. I can take care (a), cannot take care (b) of my household.

      Methodological Note: The questionnaire will be handed out to all patients coming to the
      outpatient clinic in the year 2017 by non-medical (administrative) personnel. The number of
      returned questionnaires will be counted and compared to the number of questionnaires that was
      handed out. Only the sex of the patient receiving the questionnaire will be recorded. The
      return of the questionnaire will be anonymous, by placing a box in the patient waiting area.

      Statistics:

      Data will be entered into an IBM SPSS statistics database. Descriptive analysis and graphical
      illustrations will be performed.
