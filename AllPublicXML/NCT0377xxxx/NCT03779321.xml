  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male subjects with specific body characteristics were recruited for the study. Subjects did
      an acceptability test on custard and completed a screening questionnaire. Around 30 subjects
      (15 with a normal BMI and 15 obese) continued the study. At each test day, fasting blood
      samples were withdrawn by a registered nurse under sterile conditions. This procedure was
      followed by ingestion of one of the two meals within a period of 10-15 minutes. Blood samples
      of 5 ml were collected at fasting and after ingestion of meals. At the end, subjects were
      given ad lib access to cheese pizza to assess energy intake after the custard preload. Blood
      analysis for GLP-1, ghrelin, insulin and glucose levels were performed.

      Male subjects were recruited for the study based on the following criteria: age between 18
      and 50, body mass index normal or obese, non-smokers, non-alcoholic, and do not take
      medications. Subjects did an acceptability test on custard and completed a screening
      questionnaire. Around 30 subjects (15 with a normal BMI and 15 obese) continued the study.
      Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two meals. Each of the two meals was ingested after
      a 3-day adaptation period. The meals had similar macronutrient composition and provided
      energy equivalent to 30% of the subjects' resting energy expenditure. At each test day,
      fasting blood samples were withdrawn by a registered nurse under sterile conditions. This
      procedure was followed by ingestion of one of the two meals within a period of 10-15 minutes.
      Blood samples of 5 ml were collected at fasting and after ingestion of meals at 15, 30, 60,
      120, 180 and 240 minutes. At the end, subjects were given ad lib access to cheese pizza to
      assess energy intake after the custard preload. Blood analysis for GLP-1, ghrelin, insulin
      and glucose levels were performed.
