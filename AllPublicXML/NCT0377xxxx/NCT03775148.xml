  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of a transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Treatment (TranS-C)
      in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in Chinese adults. Sleep disturbance is highly
      comorbid with a range of psychological disorders, especially MDD. MDD is a major public
      health concern and a leading cause of disability worldwide. A shift in treatment
      perspectives, from a disorder-specific approach to a transdiagnostic approach, has been
      proposed. While the disorder-specific approach tends to understand and treat different mental
      disorders as independent psychological problems, the transdiagnostic approach aims to
      identify common clinical features (e.g. sleep disturbances) across a range of psychological
      disorders. The transdiagnostic approach would potentially facilitate timely dissemination of
      evidence-based psychological treatments and contribute to significant public health
      implications.

      This study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of TranS-C for MDD.
      TranS-C integrates elements of evidence-based interventions, namely cognitive-behavioral
      therapy for insomnia, delayed sleep phase type, and interpersonal and social rhythm therapy.
      Prior to all study procedures, an online informed consent (with phone support) will be
      obtained from potential participants. Around 40 eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to the TranS-C group or the care-as-usual control group (CAU group) in a ratio of
      1:1. The randomization will be performed by an independent assessor using a
      computer-generated list of numbers. No deception is necessary. Participants in the TranS-C
      group will receive TranS-C once per week for 6 consecutive weeks respectively. The group
      treatment will be delivered by a clinical psychology trainee under the supervision of a
      clinical psychologist. The TranS-C group will complete a set of online/paper-and-pencil
      questionnaires before the treatment commences, 1-week, and 12-week after the treatment
      sessions are completed. The CAU group will complete the same set of online/paper-and-pencil
      questionnaires during the same periods.

    <measure>Change in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9, a 20-item questionnaire used for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represents mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item self-rating scale that measures anxiety and depression in both hospital and community settings. It is divided into an Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a Depression subscale (HADS-D) both containing seven intermingled items. It is for screening purpose and not meant to be a diagnostic tool. HADS scores of 8-10, 11-14, and 15-21 represent mild, moderate, and severe anxiety and depression separately.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item scale designed to evaluate perceived insomnia severity. Ratings on the 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the perceived severity of sleep-onset, sleep-maintenance, early morning awakening problems, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeably of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and level of distress caused by the sleep problem. Total score categories: 0-7 is no clinically significant insomnia, 8-14 is subthreshold insomnia,15-21 is clinical insomnia (moderate severity), and 22-28 is clinical insomnia (severe)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 7-Day Sleep Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized sleep diary records sleep-onset latency (SOL; min), wake after sleep onset (WASO; min), total wake time (TWT; min), total sleep time (TST; min), time in bed (TIB; min); sleep efficiency (SE; calculated as TST/TIB * 100%), etc. Severity of sleep disturbances: sleep latency of time awake after sleep onset greater than 30 min; or last awakening occurring more than 30 min before desired time and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours; sleep efficiency is lower than 85%. Frequency: sleep difficulties present three or more nights per week.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. Ratings on a 5-point Likert scale are obtained on the dimensions of general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity. Scores on each subscale range from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A preference-based single index measure of health. A six-digit number represents each SF-6D health state, each digit denotes the level of one of six SF-6D dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality. The SF-6D index, scored from 0.0 (worst health state) to 1.0 (best health state)</description>

    <measure>Change in Credibility-Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, 1-week post-treatment and 12-week post treatment</time_frame>

Two questions asking how much improvement in the functioning the one thinks and feels that it will occur ranging 0% to 100%.</description>
