      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence rate of leukemia between CT-exposed and
      CT-unexposed group in patients who underwent appendectomy in South Korea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Korea has a single-payer healthcare system, administered by National Health Insurance
      Service (NHIS). As healthcare providers in South Korea need to claim reimbursement to NHIS
      for the vast majority of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, the NHIS database enabled us
      to construct a large cohort who did or did not undergo CT for appendicitis. The purpose of
      this study is to compare the incidence rate of cancer between CT-exposed and CT-unexposed
      group in patients who underwent appendectomy in South Korea.

    <description>Patients are divided into CT-exposed or unexposed group according to the presence of claims codes of abdominopelvic CT conducted within seven days before and after appendectomy. The seven-day threshold is arbitrarily determined considering the delay in the diagnosis of appendicitis and the postoperative examination for surgical complication.</description>
