  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of low dose aspirin on normal fallopian tube fimbriae in
      women who have surgery to have their fallopian tubes removed. Participants will take a low
      dose of aspirin for 2 weeks before their surgery. A portion of the removed fallopian tubes
      will also be collected for future research and routine pathology purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study will receive low dose aspirin for 14 days before undergoing surgery to
      remove fallopian tubes removed to determine whether aspirin decreases inflammation in the
      fallopian tube. Subjects will also submit blood samples at their initial visit with their
      oncologist, at the time of surgery and at the pre-operative visit to measure inflammation
      markers and blood counts. A portion of the subject's fallopian tube will be collected for
      future research studies.
