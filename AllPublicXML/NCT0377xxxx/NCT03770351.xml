  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will replicate/validate the risk prediction model developed for the Comparative
      Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study in a more diverse patient
      population to assess generalizability of the model as well as evaluate the relative
      contribution of the Decipher Prostate Cancer Test and ProstateNext Test from Ambry Genetics,
      to the risk prediction model for estimating treatment outcomes, and thereby improve
      personalization of treatment options.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will contribute a replicable model for improving risk prediction from patient
      characteristics, clinical severity indicators, and genomic tests to aid in personalizing
      treatment. The proposed registry would also allow future comparisons of the gene expression
      used in other competing commercial test. The addition of the suggested genomic classifier and
      its associations with other patient and clinical characteristics will enhance the ability of
      future studies, analogous to CEASAR, to accurately predict the risk of tumor aggressiveness
      in prostate cancer.

    <time_frame>Day of enrollment, 6-months, and 12-months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] is a validated instrument for measuring disease-specific function/ The domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better function. Patients will be asked to complete the questionnaires during a consultation visit or remotely. EPIC scores will be collected at baseline, 6 month follow up, and at 12 month follow up via the questionnaire. EPIC scores from each time point will then be compared to look at the change in quality of life over the duration of the study.</description>
