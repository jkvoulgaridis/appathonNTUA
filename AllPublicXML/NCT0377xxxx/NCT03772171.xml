  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical research is to evaluate the relevance of using the EPA slide to
      estimate dietary intakes in dialysis patients. The obtained results will be compared with the
      reference technique validated by the HAS: food intake over 3 days.

      The aim is also to improve the global management of dialysis patients and improve their
      quality of life. The aim is to evaluate a quick and easy-to-use tool whose use has been
      demonstrated in hospitals but for which no study has been carried out in an ambulatory
      hospitalization context.

    <description>The Gold Standard will calculate the energy intake of the patient from the food intake over 3 days, as a percentage of its energy needs, calculated according to the weight of the patient (actual weight if weight &lt;30kg.m² and weight adjusted if weight ≥ 30kg.m²).</description>
