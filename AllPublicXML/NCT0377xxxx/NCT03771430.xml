  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention consisting
      of cognitive behavioral therapy delivered as an e-therapy program, combined with physical
      exercise delivered by physiotherapists, for patients at high risk for non-improvement if they
      undergo total knee arthroplasty. The patients will be randomized to either 1) a non-surgical
      program consisting of web-based cognitive behavioral therapy combined with physiotherapy, 2)
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery followed by web-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      combined with physiotherapy, or 3) a control group who undergo TKA followed by standard
      physiotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multidisciplinary trial testing an intervention delivered by physiotherapists.
      Up to 20% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients continue to experience moderate/severe
      pain 12 months after TKA. While physical therapy (PT) and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)
      have shown promise for improving outcomes, they have not been evaluated in combination or in
      patients at risk for chronic pain after TKA. This trial will evaluate PT+CBT combined, either
      as a substitute for or as a supplement to TKA for patients at risk for chronic pain after
      TKA.

      Pilot/Feasibility study:

      The study will include a feasibility/pilot study with 15 patients to be performed from
      November 2018. The intervention and study procedures may be modified based on results from
      the feasibility/pilot study.

      Full scale Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):

      The full-scale RCT will include 230 patients scheduled for TKA and identified as being at
      risk for chronic pain based on previously established preoperative criteria. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) non-surgical intervention (i.e., PT+CBT), 2) a
      combination of TKA with pre- and postoperative PT+CBT, or 3) A control group receiving TKA
      and usual care follow-up. Primary outcome: The Pain subscale from the KOOS. The intervention
      has the potential to improve outcomes for patients who currently obtain little benefit from
      standard TKA.

    <measure>Change in the knee injury and osteoarthritis score (KOOS) pain subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>From before randomization until 12 months. Also measured at 3, 6, and 24 months after treatment start.12 months after treatment start will be the primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a knee-specific, patient administered questionnaire developed to evaluate short- and long-term symptoms and functioning in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis. KOOS is validated for use in total knee arthroplasty and has been shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure. KOOS is a patient-administered questionnaire.
The KOOS is a knee joint specific questionnaire with 42 items designed to assess patients' opinions about their difficulties with activity due to problems with their knees during the past week. The pain subscale of the KOOS consists of 9 items that assess frequency of pain and pain severity in different situations. Each of the 42 items carries equal weighting (0-4), with higher scores indicating better functioning. The pain subscale score will be transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no problems.</description>

The KOOS is a knee joint specific questionnaire with 42 items designed to assess patients' opinions about their difficulties with activity due to problems with their knees during the past week. KOOS has 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), function in sport and recreation, and knee-related QOL.

The PCS assesses three dimensions of catastrophizing (i.e., rumination (range 0-16), magnification (range: 0-12, helplessness (range 0 -24). Higher scores indicate higher levels of catastrophic thinking related to pain. A total score can be computed by summing responses to all 13 items. PCS total scores range from 0-52. Higher scores indicate higher levels of catastrophic thinking related to pain.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>From before randomization until 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) is a widely-used self-report measure of sleep disturbance during the past month. The PSQI consists of 19 items that measures different aspects of sleep. The 19 items produce 7 component scores (i.e., duration of sleep, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, day dysfunction due to sleepiness, sleep efficiency, overall sleep quality, need for sleep medications) each ranging from 0-3 where higher score indicate poorer sleep. All component scores can be summarized to a global score that range from 0 to 21 where higher scores indicate poorer sleep quality. The PSQI has good validity and reliability.</description>

    <time_frame>From before randomization until 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to measure self-reported psychological distress (depression and anxiety). The scale consists of 14 items, 7 on the depression subscale and 7 on the anxiety subscale. The Norwegian version has excellent psychometric properties. Each subscale range from 0-21 where higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety or depression. A total score (range 0 - 42) can be calculated from summarizing all the 14 items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety/depression.</description>

    <description>The Fear-Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ) will be used to measure pain-related fear of movement. The instrument consists of 2 subscales, fear-avoidance beliefs for work, and fear-avoidance beliefs for physical activity (FABQ-PA). Only the FABQ-PA subscale will be used in this study. The FABQ-PA consists of 4 items where patients rate their agreement with 5 statements about pain and physical activity. The FABQ-PA range from 0-24 and higher scores indicate higher levels of pain-related fear of movement.</description>

    <description>The Health Locus of Control Scale (HLCS) will be used to measure patients' anticipations between own health and disease behavior and consequences of the behavior. The scale consists of 18 statements. Patients rate their agreement on a 6 point likert scale ranging from disagrees completely to agrees completely. Scoring: The scoring system consists of 3 subscales: The Internal Locus of Control, the Powerful Others Health Locus of Control, and the Chance Health Locus of control. The scores are obtained by summing items for each subscale. Higher scores indicate stronger agreement or inclination towards that particular subscale.</description>
