  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the capability of a patient with Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) to generate an immune
      response to the Shingrix vaccine under first-line BTK inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) are known risk
      factors for zoster reactivation, commonly called shingles. Although a recently FDA-approved
      recombinant, adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) is currently being offered to these
      populations, no study has specifically evaluated them.

      The purpose of the study is to complete a single-arm trial evaluating if patients with CLL or
      WM, while on treatment with first-line BTK inhibitors, can achieve immunologic response to
      Shingrix. If effective, this will result in a new, well-tolerated shingles prevention
      strategy for these patients.

      The primary objective is to assess the capability to mount a humoral immune response to
      Shingrix in patients with CLL or WM under first-line BTK inhibitors.

    <description>Vaccine response, as determined by blood antibody levels to the varicella virus glycoprotein E subunit (anti-gE); Baseline is defined as pre-vaccination anti-gE titer in seropositive subjects, and the lower limit of detection in seronegative subjects</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Blood draws performed to measure persistence of measurable anti-gE and cellular-mediated immunity; cellular-mediated response will be determined by measuring PMBC activation (by ELISPOT or flow cytometry) following stimulation with varicella glycoprotein E peptide. PBMC activation at 4 weeks and 1 year post dose will be compared to pre-vaccination activation levels.</description>
