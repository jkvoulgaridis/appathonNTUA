  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether endothelial dysfunction could be the early subclinical mechanism
      by which posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk,
      and whether posttraumatic fear—a key component of PTSD—or another PTSD dimension could be the
      target to offset that risk. The results of this study may help trauma-exposed individuals who
      are at risk of having CVD events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      by 25-50%. Most individuals (50-90%) experience a traumatic event in their lifetime, and PTSD
      is the fifth most common psychiatric disorder. Experts have now called for increased CVD
      surveillance after trauma and for PTSD treatment trials powered to reduce CVD risk. However,
      both CVD risk and PTSD are complex phenomena that likely interact in nuanced ways. This study
      will determine which PTSD dimension(s) contribute to endothelial dysfunction, one of the
      earliest modifiable precursors to CVD. The investigators will examine cross-sectional and
      longitudinal associations of PTSD and its underlying dimensions with functional and,
      secondarily, cellular measures of endothelial dysfunction (FMD and circulating endothelial
      cell-derived microparticles, respectively) in a community-dwelling sample of CVD-free adult
      men and women with a history of trauma (50% with current PTSD).

    <measure>Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) %</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>FMD is the percent difference in diameter of the brachial artery, before and after occlusion. Impaired endothelial function occurs when blood vessels are unable to dilate fully in response to nitric oxide synthesis and release, which is manifested as impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation (i.e., lower FMD). Lower FMD has been associated with the degree of coronary atherosclerosis and predicts CVD events.</description>

    <measure>Circulating EMPs expressing CD62E</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EMPs expressing CD62E (i.e., endothelial cell activation) and CD31 (i.e., endothelial cell apoptosis) will be measured. Assessments of circulating EMPs will be measured using flow cytometry, and total flow cytometry counts will be converted to the number of EMPs per uL of blood. Higher concentrations of EMPs expressing CD62E and CD31 indicate greater endothelial dysfunction.</description>
