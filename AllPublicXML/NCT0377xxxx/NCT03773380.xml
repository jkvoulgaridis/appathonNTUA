  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivorship programs have become an integral component of modern cancer care programs. In
      Canada, there has been tremendous success for survivorship programs for breast, prostate, and
      colorectal cancer, however lung cancer survivorship programs have not been widely developed.
      The complexity of the disease, high mortality, short survival times, high cost of
      surveillance, and patient habits have traditionally been barriers against the success of lung
      cancer survivorship programs. The investigator proposes a feasibility study to pilot a novel
      intervention titled Breathe Anew, which will aim to identify and overcome the barriers to the
      design and implementation of a lung cancer survivorship program. The investigator has
      assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts and lung cancer survivors who will develop the
      Breathe Anew survivorship intervention. The intervention will be vetted using an integrated
      knowledge translation approach, which will involve members of the target population,
      primarily patients who previously underwent lung resection, to modify the intervention and
      ensure acceptability. After Breathe Anew has been designed, it will be tested in a pilot
      study of 50 patients to ensure its feasibility and determine its cost. The ultimate goal of
      this feasibility study is to lay the groundwork for a subsequent comparative trial to
      evaluate the impact of Breathe Anew on patient-important outcomes including health related
      quality and length of life and postoperative complications.
