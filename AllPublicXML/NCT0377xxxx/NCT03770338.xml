  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate any difference of insertional torque strength for
      osteoporotic patients with preoperative 1-month teriparatide injections versus those without.
      The increased insertional torque of pedicle screws during surgery after only 1 month of
      teriparatide use has also been studied. However, the effect of teriparatide on vertebral body
      bone mineral density (BMD) prior to and after fusion surgery has not been studied. The
      effects on screw insertional torque has also not been studied via a randomized controlled
      trial method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this project, adult patients (&gt;40 years) undergoing lumbar spinal fusion will be
      randomized to undergo teriparatide treatment for 1 month prior to surgery. Patients will have
      their baseline BMD assessed by DEXA scan must be considered as osteoporotic (&gt;2.5 SD from
      sex-matched young adult, or previous vertebral and/or femoral fractures) and indicated for
      spinal fusion surgery to undergo study. Exclusion criteria included Paget disease of bone,
      high laboratory tests for serum alkaline phosphatase or calcium, previous radiation treatment
      or fusion surgery to lumbar spine, bone tumors, metabolic bone disease, and hypersensitivity
      to teriparatide. Surgery involving single- or multi-level lumbar spinal fusion for any of the
      conditions: lumbar spinal stenosis, degenerative/isthmic/congenital spondylolisthesis,
      degenerative scoliosis. Only the surgeon and assessors will be blinded as patients will know
      their treatment arm.

      Patients undergo a quantitative CT prior to initiation of teriparatide treatment. After one
      month of Teriparatide treatment, the drug is discontinued with another DEXA scan to see the
      changes in BMD. A quantitative CT will be performed after surgery and at 6 months
      postoperatively. Follow-up schedules include preoperative, immediate postoperative,
      postoperative 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and at 24 months. At all follow-up
      timepoints, any complications, fusion demonstrated by cross-trabeculation on x-rays (with
      final confirmation at the 6 month CT), and objective questionnaires for quality of life
      including the EuroQoL 5 dimensions 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), back pain numeric rating
      scale (NRS), osteoporosis assessment questionnaire-physical function (OPAQ-PF) and ambulatory
      status assessment (ASA) questionnaires will be recorded. Other quality-of-life scores include
      ODI and SF-36, along with adherence evaluation of osteoporosis treatment (ADEOS),
      osteoporosis attitude questionnaire and osteoporosis knowledge questionnaire. Once a patient
      is identified to be suitable for this protocol, they will need to be assessed by a medical
      social worker to be unable to afford this entire treatment regimen before institutional
      support for the drug treatment is provided.

    <description>This is a self-perceived severity of back pain. The scores range from minimum 0 (no pain) to maximum 10 (most painful) in a scale of severity. Hence, a higher value represents worse outcome. There are two subquestions: 1) What the patient indicates as the most severe pain in the past 24 hours of answering the questionnaire; 2) The patient indicates the score of the usual pain status in the past 24 hours. 0 represents no pain, 1-3 represents mild pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with ADLs), 4-6 represents moderate pain (interferes significantly with ADLs), and 7-10 represents severe pain (disabling; unable to perform ADLs).</description>

    <description>This is a general osteoporosis score with 15 questions split into three categories (mobility, balance and transfer). A Likert scale of 6 answers are possible for each question from &quot;no difficulties&quot; to &quot;unable to perform&quot; in a scale of severity. A total score can be tabulated from adding all domain scores. Higher values indicate better outcome. A 0-100 scale provides a total score, where 0 indicates the worst health status and 100 no difficulties.</description>
