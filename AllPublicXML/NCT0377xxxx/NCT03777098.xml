  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to acquire images using the Strepic® device, a clinical
      prototype that has been designed specifically as a viable, low-cost, commercially realizable
      autofluorescence-based diagnostic test, using (1) fluorescence and (2) white light image
      data, as well as other clinical data points. By acquiring and analyzing the images of
      pharyngeal bacterial fluorescence and white light patterns in patients with Group A
      Streptococcus (GAS)-associated pharyngitis and comparing them with those observed in non-GAS
      pharyngitis, it is believed an algorithm can be developed such that the device will improve
      the ability of clinicians to quickly and accurately identify GAS infections.

    <description>The Strepic® device is a qualitative point-of-care diagnostic test for the detection of GAS pharyngitis. The test uses direct visualization of the pharynx with a light source of specified wavelengths, causing excitation of endogenous fluorophores that emit a characteristic colored light pattern. White light images may give additional diagnostic accuracy through use of an artificial intelligence analysis of a large set of images of GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis.</description>

             detained pending arraignment, trial, or sentencing; and (3) detained in other
             facilities (e.g., for drug detoxification or treatment of alcoholism) under statutes
             or commitment procedures providing such alternatives to criminal prosecution or
             incarceration in a penal institution).
