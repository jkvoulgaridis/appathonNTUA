    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a financial navigation program intervention works in supporting
      patients with solid tumors and their caregivers. The financial navigation program
      intervention is an educational course about cancer treatment cost. This educational course
      may provide cancer patients and their caregivers with helpful information about dealing with
      cancer treatment cost.
