    <textblock>
      The majority of asthmatic patients are well controlled by inhaled corticosteroid treatment,
      however some severe asthma resist this treatment. CCL18 is a target gene for corticosteroids
      and its dysfunction may correlate with phenotypes of asthma.

               -  being asymptomatic between asthma attacks,

               -  with symptoms less than once a week

               -  having a forced expiratory volume per second (FEV1) of at least 80% of the
