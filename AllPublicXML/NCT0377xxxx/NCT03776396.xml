  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In literature there is a huge amount of works demonstrating the direct correlation between
      volemic overload or fluid deficit and hypoperfusion and the increase in the rate of major
      postoperative complications in patients with high cardiovascular risk and chronic renal
      failure candidate to kidney transplantation from cadaver. It is also widely demonstrated that
      in certain populations with high surgical and post-operative complications risk, the adoption
      of targeted haemodynamic and clinical-therapeutic management protocols is indicated. The
      current trend is therefore to guarantee greater precision in the intraoperative management of
      patients undergoing kidney transplantation from cadaver by using a specific protocol that can
      be framed in the recent and innovative concept of Perioperative Gold Directed Therapy (PGDT),
      resulting from the adoption of an advanced minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring
      technology with a special sensor called FloTrac (Edwards Lifesciences), already extensively
      tested in an extensive case series of high perioperative risk patients underwent to major
      abdominal surgery, major vascular surgery, major orthopedic surgery and cardio-thoracic
      surgery. In the present study there will be enrolled all patients who are candidates for
      kidney transplant from cadaver at the University Hospital &quot;G. Rodolico&quot; of Catania that meet
      the inclusion criteria of the study and will give their informed consent to participation.
      The enrolled patients will be monitored for a maximum period of 7 days from transplantation.
      As control group there will be considered an historical cohort of patients who underwent
      kidney transplantation from cadaver in 2015, in which a PGDT protocol was not used, but a
      common hemodynamic monitoring, based on parameters such as central venous pressure and / or
      invasive arterial pressure, was performed according to the international guidelines.
