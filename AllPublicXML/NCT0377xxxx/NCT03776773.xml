  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that allergic rhinitis (AR) reduces sleep quality by some components
      such as nasal obstruction. Pollution and allergen exposure worsening AR, sleep quality is
      deteriorated.

      Sleep is associated to physical and mental health, alterations in sleep could explain the
      link between AR and work productivity diminution, impairment in daily activities or emotional
      problems.

      However, interactions between air pollution, sleep and allergic diseases are insufficiently
      understood.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the impact of pollution and pollens on sleep
      parameters.

    <textblock>
      Over 150 million people have allergic rhinitis (AR) in Europe and around 30% have
      uncontrolled AR during allergen exposure. It has been demonstrated that AR reduces sleep
      quality by some components such as nasal obstruction. Pollution and allergen exposure
      worsening AR, sleep quality is deteriorated.

      Sleep is associated to physical and mental health, alterations in sleep could explain the
      link between AR and work productivity diminution, impairment in daily activities or emotional
      problems.

      However, interactions between air pollution, sleep and allergic diseases are insufficiently
      understood.

      Moreover, the prevalence of OSA in patients with AR is higher than in subjects without AR.
      Nasal obstruction could explain the increased risk of OSA.

      This prospective, open study will compare sleep quality in 2 different groups: AR patients
      and patients without AR during the pollen season and outside the pollen season.The main
      objective is to determine the impact of pollution and pollens on sleep parameters for
      subjects with AR
