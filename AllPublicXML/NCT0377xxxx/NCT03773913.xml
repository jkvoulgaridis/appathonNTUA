    <textblock>
      This preliminary study aims to inform the design and delivery of the integrated facility and
      community-based health systems strengthening (ICBHSS) model in four Kozah District health
      facilities over a period of 48 months. Specific aims include: (1) Assess maternal and child
      health outcomes and health service utilization rates in the 4 ICBHSS model intervention sites
      catchment areas; (2) Identify barriers to and facilitators of access and quality services
      related to ICBHSS model; and (3) Assess changes in health care services coverage,
      effectiveness, and adoption of ICBHSS model.

      Intervention: The investigators have adapted an integrated facility and community-based
      health systems strengthening (ICBHSS) model to improve primary healthcare services in Togo.
      The ICBHSS model includes a bundle of evidence based interventions including (1) community
      engagement meetings and feedback; (2) the elimination of facility user fees for children
      under five and pregnant women; (3) pro-active community based IMCI using Community Health
      Workers (CHWs) with additional services including linkage to family planning and counseling,
      HIV testing &amp; referrals; (4) clinical mentoring and enhanced supervision at public sector
      facilities; and (5) improved supply chain management and facility structures.

      Study: The investigators will conduct a mixed methods assessment, using the RE-AIM framework
      to evaluate the impact and implementation of the ICBHSS initiative in Kozah district. It will
      include: (1) a repeated cross-sectional study to obtain annual coverage, effectiveness, and
      adoption metrics using a population-based household survey as well as (2) qualitative key
      informant interviews and focus group discussions conducted at 12 months for each intervention
      health facility. The primary outcome will be under 5 year old mortality rate, with secondary
      outcomes including under-one mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, as well as maternal and
      child health service utilization.
