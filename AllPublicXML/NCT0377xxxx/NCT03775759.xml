      The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of tricuspid valve repair at the time
      of LVAD implantation for patients presenting with moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation.
      The study will be a randomized trial for patients presenting for LVAD implantation to either
      tricuspid valve repair or no tricuspid valve repair. The data will be analyzed as both an
      intention to treat analysis as well as an &quot;as treated&quot; analysis with the primary outcome
      being rates of right ventricular dysfunction post LVAD implantation. Tricuspid valve repair
      for these patient is currently being done for some patients, without any strong data to
      either support such practice or negate it.

      This study is a prospective, single center, randomized trial. Up to 280 subjects will be
      enrolled.

      Inclusion Criteria - Potential subjects must meet all inclusion criteria to participate.

        -  Planned LVAD implantation (either destination or bridge indication)

        -  18 years of age or older

        -  Patients wilith mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR) during surgical planning will be
           screened for meeting inclusion criteria for this study.

        -  TR on pre-operative echo (within one week of procedure) (TTE or intraoperative TEE)
           quantified as moderate or severe with normal tricuspid valve leaflets

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  Previous tricuspid valve surgery

        -  Previous LVAD

        -  Planned concurrent right ventricular assist device (RVAD) or extracorporeal membrane
           oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of LVAD operation or during the same hospitalization

        -  Preimplant RVAD or ECMO

        -  Planned thoracotomy approach for LVAD implantation

        -  Pregnant women

      All subjects will undergo an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate
      their tricuspid valve. Subjects will be randomized in the operating room. Randomization will
      be stratified based on preoperative right ventricle dysfunction. Subjects will be randomized
      1:1 to either of the following treatment arms:

        -  Study arm (Arm A) - Tricuspid valve ring annuloplasty or replacement at the time of LVAD
           implantation plus medical therapy

        -  Control arm (Arm B) - LVAD implantation plus medical therapy (the medical therapy
           involved includes inotropic medications and diuretic medications, which are standard of
           care for patients in this population)

      Subjects will be monitored in the surgical and on the step down floor ICU, and follow-up data
      will be collected on subjects monthly from routine tests and clinic visits. This will include
      information on adverse events and any hospital readmissions, a quality of life questionnaire
      at their 6 month visit, and a six minute walk test at three and 6 months.
