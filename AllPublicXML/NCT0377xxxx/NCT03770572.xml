      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, single dose, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of AT-GTX-502 (previous NCH Code: scAAV9.P546.CLN3) delivered
      intrathecally into the lumbar spinal cord region of subjects with CLN3 Batten disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, single-dose, dose-escalation study of AT-GTX-502
      administered intrathecally into the lumbar spinal cord region of pediatric patients with CLN3
      Batten disease.

      This study consists of a one-time injection of AT-GTX-502 with follow-up visits on Day 7, 14,
      21, and 30, followed by every 3 months through 1 year post-dose, and then every 6 months
      through the second and third years. There are two Cohorts with a low dose and a high dose.

      The primary outcome for this clinical study is to evaluate safety. The co-primary objective
      is to determine the efficacy of AT-GTX-502 as measured by United Batten Disease Rating Scale
      (UBDRS) physical subscale.

      The secondary outcome measures include Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) inventory, seizure
      subscale of the UBDRS and global impression subscale of the UBDRS.

      The exploratory outcome measures include visual impairment assessment, cognitive evaluations,
      Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG)
      and echocardiogram (ECHO).

Dose escalation in this study will begin with low-dose, determined to be the minimal efficacious dose as determined in non-clinical studies. Dose escalation to a high-dose (2x the minimally effective dose (MED) as evaluated in Cohort 1) will proceed as part of Cohort 2 of the study upon demonstration of safety of the low-dose in Cohort 1 of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Efficacy: Change in rating as determined using the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) rating scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UBDRS is a clinical ratings instrument used specifically to assess motor, seizure, behavioral and functional capabilities. The &quot;Physical Assessment&quot; is a 20 item subscale that measures vision, speech, motor strength, gait, abnormal involuntary movements and balance. Each item has a score range of 0 to 4. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 112. The items are summed up to obtain a total score.The higher the score, the more severe the disability and worse the outcome.</description>
