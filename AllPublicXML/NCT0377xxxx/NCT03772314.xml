    <textblock>
      For diseases that cause excessive daytime sleepiness (such as narcolepsy and idiopathic
      hypersomnia), there are several medications that can be used to treat sleepiness. However, it
      can be difficult to decide which medication to use for a particular individual for several
      reasons: 1) there are very few studies that directly compare two medications to see which
      works best; 2) there are very few studies that include people with a disorder of sleepiness
      called idiopathic hypersomnia.

      To address this gap in knowledge, the researchers propose a randomized clinical trial
      comparing modafinil and amphetamine salts in patients with narcolepsy type 2 or idiopathic
      hypersomnia. All participants will either receive modafinil or amphetamine salts -- no
      participant will receive placebo.

      This study will evaluate which medication works better to improve sleepiness. The researchers
      will also see which medication is better for other symptoms including difficulty waking up
      and difficulty thinking, as well as seeing which medication causes fewer side. Finally, this
      study will see if any information about patients (such as age or sleep study features)
      predicts responding better to one medication or the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are insufficient data to guide clinical practice regarding the use of
      amphetamines for the treatment of narcolepsy. This may be particularly important in the case
      of narcolepsy type 2, for which randomized, controlled trial data show that other treatments
      are less beneficial than they are for participants with narcolepsy type 1. For the closely
      related disorder of idiopathic hypersomnia, clinical trial data to guide treatment
      decision-making are even more limited, with only three published controlled trials ever
      performed.

      To address these evidence gaps, the researchers propose a randomized, active-treatment
      controlled trial comparing modafinil and amphetamine salts for the treatment of narcolepsy
      type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. The primary outcome will be reduction in excessive daytime
      sleepiness, as measured by change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores from baseline to week 12
      on treatment. Other important patient-reported outcomes will be considered as secondary
      outcomes, including Patient Global Impression of Change for sleep inertia, cognitive
      dysfunction, and sleepiness.

      In addition to directly comparing the efficacy of these two medications for hypersomnolent
      patients, this study will also evaluate for relatively safety in this population. Further,
      this study will assess clinical predictors of treatment response. All three of these aims
      will be complementary in informing shared decision-making about whether to treat with
      modafinil or amphetamine salts.

      Forty-four treatment-na√Øve adult patients seeking evaluation at the Emory Sleep Center for
      narcolepsy type 2 or idiopathic hypersomnia will be invited to participate and will be
      randomized to one of the treatment arms upon consent. Participants will receive study
      treatment for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) asks respondents to indicate how likely they are to doze off or fall asleep during daytime situations such as reading or talking to someone. There are 8 items which are answered on a scale of 0 to 4 where 0 = would never doze and 4 = high chance of dozing. Total score can range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more sleepiness. A score of 0 to 5 can be interpreted as &quot;lower normal daytime sleepiness&quot;, a score of 6 to 10 is &quot;higher normal daytime sleepiness&quot;, score between 11 to 12 are &quot;mild excessive daytime sleepiness, scores of 13 to 15 are &quot;moderate excessive daytime sleepiness&quot; and scores of 16 to 24 indicate &quot;severe excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;.</description>

    <description>The PGIc for Sleepiness asks respondents to rate their sleepiness compared to baseline. Responses are indicated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <description>The PGIc for Sleep Inertia asks respondents to rate their sleep interia compared to baseline. Sleep inertia is defined for participants as &quot;difficulty waking up and getting out of bed in the morning because of sleepiness&quot;. Responses are indicated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse.</description>

Cognitive dysfunction is defined for participants as &quot;difficulty with thinking, problems with attention or concentration, and/or brain fog&quot;. Responses are indicated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse.</description>
