  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a randomized, non-blinded, single-centre trial in patients presenting
      with 5 to 20 brain metastases. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone or SRS plus whole brain radiation (WBRT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for patients with limited brain metastases (1 to 4) is
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone. This has evolved from the traditional standard of care
      in treating patients with whole brain radiation (WBRT). Studies in patients with limited
      (less than 5) brain metastases have shown that WBRT is harmful with respect to neurocognition
      and does not improve patient survival compared to SRS alone. As a result, SRS alone now is
      considered the standard of care treatment for patients with limited metastases. However,
      there is a lack of high quality prospective randomized evidence on the role of SRS in
      patients with 5 or more brain metastases to guide treatment.

      Therefore, this study seeks to compare SRS alone versus SRS plus WBRT in patients with 5 to
      20 brain metastases in a randomized, non-blinded, single-centre trial.
