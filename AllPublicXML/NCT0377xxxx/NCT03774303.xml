  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Finland about 50% of surgical operations for all under 16 years of age are made as day
      surgery which means that the patient comes to the hospital and is discharged on the day of
      the operation. Day surgery will continue to grow in the next few years. Its benefits include
      shorter hospitalization, family reunion and rapid recovery. The preschool children and their
      parents who come in for day surgery feel fear, anxiety and stress, which depend on the amount
      of knowledge and its quality. By developing the preparation of preschool children and their
      parents for day surgery, and by testing new methods more attention can be paid to the special
      features of day surgery, supporting the families, and increasing family involvement in the
      whole process.

      The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate the effectiveness of a new mobile
      application intervention compared to the effectiveness of the traditional preparing method
      when measuring preschool children's fear and pain and their parents' anxiety and stress. The
      aim is to produce new information and to develop day surgery of preschool children.

      The study consist of two phases. The first phase of the research is a systematic literature
      review and meta-analysis. The purpose of the review is to assess and describe the methods
      previously used in the preparation of parental day surgery and their effectiveness for
      preschool children fear and pain and parents' anxiety and stress. The second phase of the
      study is carried out as a randomized controlled trial (=RCT). The parents of the preschool
      children are randomized to the mobile application group (n = 50-60) and the control group (n
      = 50-60). The sample size is based on power-analysis, with anxiety as the primary outcome.
      The material for the second phase of the study is collected at the day surgery department of
      the Oulu University Hospital. The study group is prepared for day surgery with a new mobile
      application and the control group according to the traditional preparing method. The study
      examines the effectiveness of a new intervention compared to the effectiveness of the
      traditional preparing method when measuring preschool children's fear and pain and their
      parents' anxiety and stress. The collected data are analyzed using the Mann-Whitney, t-test,
      Khi square test, and Fisher's accurate test.

    <measure>Parents' Anxiety measured with STAI-Y1.</measure>
    <time_frame>first measurement at home before the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI meter is a two-part adult anxiety meter developed by Charles D. Spielberg and his research team (1983). It separates situation related anxiety (STATE-A = Y1) from character related tendency towards anxiety (TRAIT-A). In this study, the most commonly used version of the STAI meter and only it's STATE-A section is utilized. Here, the parent evaluates his own current anxiety on a four-step scale with twenty questions. The respondents choose from the following options at each question: 1 = no anxiety at all, 2 = slight anxiety, 3 = some anxiety 4 = very much anxiety.</description>
