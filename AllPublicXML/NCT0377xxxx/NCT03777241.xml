  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the impact of a behavioral intervention team
      (BIT) on 2 adult units: a general medical (8N); a cardiac/medical stepdown (8S) at Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center (VUMC) with a higher proportion of patients with behavioral health
      comorbidities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BIT will provide a proactive psychiatric team that will screen all patients on admission,
      provide consultation to those meeting established criteria, and recommend interventions to
      the primary care team for consideration. BIT will also serve to model therapeutics tactics in
      communication and goal setting to the clinical staff.

      Research Questions for the proposed study:

      Considering that behavioral health co-morbidity is common among hospitalized medical
      inpatients and is associated with higher costs of care and staff dissatisfaction, we will
      ascertain whether the addition of dedicated, trained behavioral intervention team, compared
      to nursing staff training on trauma informed care and de-escalation techniques provides:

        1. meaningful, measureable improvement in the prevention and management of disruptive
           behavior in the healthcare setting at VUMC, and

        2. Improvement in staff perceptions of their ability to manage patients exhibiting
           disruptive, threatening or acting out behavior

      Specifically, using a pragmatic, cluster cross-over trial design where the BIT crosses
      between 8N and 8S, we will test the hypothesis that presence of the BIT results in:

        1. Improvement in the prevention and management of patients exhibiting disruptive,
           threatening or acting out behavior

        2. Improvement in staff perceptions of their ability to manage patients exhibiting
           disruptive, threatening or acting out behavior
