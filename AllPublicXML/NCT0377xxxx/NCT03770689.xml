      The main purpose of the study is to define maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase II
      dose (RP2D) of M3814 in combination with capecitabine and radiotherapy (RT) in Phase Ib and
      to evaluate the efficacy of M3814 in terms of Pathological Clinical Response (pCR)/Clinical
      Complete Response (cCR) when administered in combination with capecitabine and RT versus
      placebo, capecitabine, and RT in Phase II.
