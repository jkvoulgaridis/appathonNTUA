  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Parkinson Disease's (PD) is usually associated with an older patient population, 5%
      of patients are diagnosed at age 50 and 30% before 65 years of age. This shows that many
      patients with PD have diagnosed during the active study and have long periods of normal
      retirement. After the diagnosis of Parkinson's patients, the duration of leaving of
      employment vary between 0 and 25 years. It was found that patients' full-time working
      capacity decreased by up to 80% and they quitted earlier than the general population. The
      disability associated with PD is thought to be a factor in this situation. Nevertheless, the
      reasons for early retirement are not fully known and more information is needed on the
      specific problems of PD in order for patients to continue their career. The aim of our study
      is to examine the impact of Parkinson's disease on retirement and to contribute to Turkey's
      data. Patients with PD admitted to the Parkinson's disease outpatient clinic, which is the
      biggest clinic of Turkey about neurology, are included in the study. It is planned to meet
      with 75 patients on 31/12/2018 and to reach the end of the data collection phase.
