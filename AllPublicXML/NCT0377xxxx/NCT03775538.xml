  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an extension to the HP-CD-CL-2002 clinical study. It evaluates the long-term
      safety and tolerability of CDNF in patients with Parkinson's disease when dosed directly into
      the brain using an implanted investigational drug delivery system (DDS). Long-term safety of
      the DDS is also being evaluated. All patients will receive monthly infusions of either mid-
      or high-dose of CDNF for a period of 6 months.

      A patient's participation in the study will last for six months and will include nine visits:

      Screening (1 visit, same as HP-CD-CL-2002 End-of-Study visit) Dosing visits: CDNF (6 visits)
      DAT-PET (1 visit) End-of-study visit (1 visit)

      Study examinations and assessments

        -  Physical examination: pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature, body weight and height,
           body mass index (BMI), neurological exam

        -  ECG (electrocardiography) and blood and urine tests

        -  Pregnancy tests for women of childbearing age

        -  Completion of a patient diary to record mobility and time asleep

        -  Parkinson's Kinetigraph (PKGTM) Data Logger: a watch-type movement recording device

        -  Questionnaires, rating scales and forms: quality of life, mood, memory, impulse control,
           mental health

        -  Assessment of the port and the skin around the port

        -  Cerebrospinal fluid sampling by lumbar puncture
