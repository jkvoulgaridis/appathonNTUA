  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is the most common genetically based food intolerance in the world, with
      a prevalence among approximately 1% of the general population (Guandalini &amp; Assiri, 2014). CD
      is a frequent disorder among Egyptian children, both in the general population and in at-risk
      groups(Abu-Zekry et al., 2008). It is estimated that the incidence of CD is 3 to13 cases
      per1000, with a higher prevalence among first-degree relatives of patients with CD.Lifelong
      adherence to a strict gluten free diet (GFD) remains the only available treatment for
      patients with CD and typically results in a complete return to health. Nevertheless, gluten
      is not found only in diet, Gluten is commonly used as a binder in products like medication,
      cosmetics, oral and skin care, and even children's toys. Gluten is found also in toothpastes
      and other oral health products and it can be swallowed by mistake and initiate immune
      response(Anon, n.d.). Unfortunately, there is no gluten free toothpaste available in the
      Egyptian market and it is very expensive if we bought it from Europe or USA. The tube will
      cost nearly 10 dolars .As a result, the production and availability of gluten free toothpaste
      in Egypt has become mandatory.
