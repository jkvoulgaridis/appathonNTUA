  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical validation study aims to evaluate the utility of Fitbit's Sleep Apnea Alert
      software for minimally invasive monitoring of sleep apnea events to alert users of their risk
      of sleep apnea. The Sleep Apnea Alert software analyses data from a Fitbit commercially
      available wrist photoplethysmogram (PPG) device. The Sleep Apnea Alert software is an
      investigational software as medical device (SaMD) and is designed to retrospectively process
      data and flag users who have physiological signals consistent with an apnea-hypopnea index
      (AHI) of 15 or greater. This clinical validation study will be used to validate Fitbit's
      PPG-based sleep apnea algorithm. The outputs of the Fitbit Sleep Apnea Alert software will
      not be available to study participants, as the scope of this study is to gather validation
      data only and does not include testing product usability components.
