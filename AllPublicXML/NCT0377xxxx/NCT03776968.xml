    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study evaluating HC-1119 single-dose pharmacokinetics and effect of food on
      its pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese adults. The study primary objective is to evaluate
      the HC-1119 pharmacokinetic characteristics and the effect of food on its pharmacokinetics in
      healthy Chinese males, subsequent to a single oral administration of HC-1119 with different
      doses in healthy Chinese males.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily signed the informed consent form.

          2. Healthy Chinese male aged between 18-45 years old (inclusive).

          3. Weight ≥ 50.0 kg, and BMI between 19.0-26.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening. BMI =
             weight (kg) / height2 (m2).

          4. Defined as &quot;healthy&quot; based on past medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
             laboratory tests, 12-Lead ECG, and chest x-ray performed at screening. All examination
             results must be within the normal range corresponding to the subject's age and gender,
             or determined by the investigator as &quot;no clinical significance (NCS)&quot; when the result
             is out of range.

          5. All male subjects and their female spouses/sexual partners with child-bearing
             potential must adopt continuous and effective contraceptive methods, that is, two
             forms of contraception should be performed spontaneously (including at least one
             barrier method), from the initiation of screening and the whole study period to at
             least three months after administration.

             arteriovenous malformation, traumatic brain injury with coma requiring
             hospitalization, and lacunar infarct).

          7. Recent history (in the past 3 years) and/or current medical history of autonomic
             dysfunction (such as recurrent syncope and palpitations).

             the study.

          9. Smokers or those who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day (or equivalent amounts of
             tobacco) within 3 months prior to the study, or those who are unable to stop smoking
