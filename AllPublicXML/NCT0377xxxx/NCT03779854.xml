  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well naive T-cell depletion works in preventing chronic
      graft-versus-host disease in children and young adults with blood cancers undergoing donor
      stem cell transplant. This study is comparing naïve T-cell depletion transplantation to the
      traditional stem cell transplantation. In these transplants, chemotherapy and total-body
      radiotherapy ('conditioning') are used to kill residual leukemia cells and the patient's
      normal blood cells, especially immune cells that could reject the donor cells. Following the
      chemo/radiotherapy, blood stem cells from the donor are infused. These stem cells will grow
      and eventually replace the patient's original blood system, including red cells that carry
      oxygen to our tissues, platelets that stop bleeding from damaged vessels, and multiple types
      of immune-system white blood cells that fight infections. Mature donor immune cells,
      especially a type of immune cell called T lymphocytes (or T cells) are transferred along with
      these blood-forming stem cells. T cells are a major part of the curative power of
      transplantation because they can attack leukemia cells that have survived the chemo/radiation
      therapy and also help to fight infections after transplantation. However, donor T cells can
      also attack a patient's healthy tissues in an often-dangerous condition known as
      Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD). Drugs that suppress immune cells are used to decrease the
      severity of GVHD; however, they are incompletely effective and prolonged immunosuppression
      used to prevent and treat GVHD significantly increases the risk of serious infections.
      Removing all donor T cells from the transplant graft can prevent GVHD, but doing so also
      profoundly delays infection-fighting immune reconstitution and eliminates the possibility
      that donor immune cells will kill residual leukemia cells. Work in animal models found that
      depleting a type of T cell, called naïve T cells or T cells that have never responded to an
      infection, can diminish GVHD while at least in part preserving some of the benefits of donor
      T cells including resistance to infection and the ability to kill leukemia cells. This
      clinical trial studies how well the selective removal of naïve T cells works in preventing
      GVHD after peripheral blood stem cell transplants compared to the subjects that receive
      unmanipulated bone marrow transplants.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. All patients receive 1 of 3 conditioning regimens.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN A: Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on
      days -10 to -7, then receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 4 hours once daily (QD) on days
      -6 and -5, and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes once daily on days -6 to -2.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN B: Patients undergo TBI BID on days -8 to -5, then receive fludarabine
      IV over 30 minutes QD on days -4 to -2, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour QD on days -3 and
      -2.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN C: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes QD on days -6 to -2,
      busulfan IV over 180 minutes QD on days -5 to -2, and undergo total body irradiation BID on
      day -1.

      ARM I: Patients receive naive T-cell depleted PBSCs on day 0.

      ARM II: Patients receive unmanipulated T cell-replete BM on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: All patients receive tacrolimus IV on days -1 to +50 followed by a taper in
      the absence of grade II-IV aGVHD. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days +1, +3, +6,
      and +11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) disease. A patient may have a history of CNS
             disease; however, any CNS disease must be cleared by the end of the pre-conditioning
             evaluation time frame. If CNS disease is identified on the first cerebrospinal fluid
             (CSF) evaluation within 30 days of the start of the preparative regimen, a repeat CSF
             evaluation must be performed and show no evidence of disease in order for the patient
             to be eligible for the protocol.

          -  Patients on other experimental protocols for the prevention of GVHD.

          -  Patient body weight:

               -  Matched related donor (MRD): &gt; 100 kg are ineligible

               -  Matched unrelated donor (MUD): &gt; 75 kg must be discussed with the protocol PI
                  prior to enrollment.

          -  HIV-positive.

          -  Uncontrolled infections must be evaluated by an infectious disease physician and
             considered suitable to undergo HCT by the study site PI, infectious disease physician
             and protocol PI. Upper respiratory tract infection (URI) does not constitute an
             uncontrolled infection in this context.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months from disease other than acute leukemia or myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS).

          -  Significant medical condition that would make recipient unsuitable for HCT.

          -  Prior allogeneic or autologous HCT.

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients of child bearing age who are presumed to be fertile and are unwilling to use
             an effective birth control method or refrain from sexual intercourse during study
             treatment and for 12 months following HCT.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus, fludarabine, or methotrexate (MTX).
