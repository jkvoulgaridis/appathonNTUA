      A randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial of high frequency rTMS treatment for
      cognitive impairments in 120 chronic schizophrenia patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the
      treatment of cognitive impairments in 120 chronic patients with schizophrenia.

      METHODS:

        1. Clinical Trial: The study consists of 8 weeks of treatment.

        2. Assessment Procedures:

      2.1 Primary Outcome Variable-Psychopathology: The psychopathology of patients was assessed by
      three clinical trained staff, who were blind to treatment protocols, using the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Patients are interviewed at screening, at at baseline, 2
      weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks.

      2.2 Cognitive tests: RBANS was used to assess the cognitive function by three psychologists,
      which is comprised of a total score and 5 age-adjusted index scores for attention, language,
      delayed and immediate memory and visuospatial/construction. A translated and adapted Chinese
      version of RBANS has been evaluated for the test-retest reliability and clinical validity
      between schizophrenia patients and control subjects. Cognitive performance was measured at
      baseline and at 8-weeks.

      2.3 Side Effects: TESS was used to assess the side effect at baseline and every 2 weeks.

      2.5 Weight gain measurement: weight gain every week
