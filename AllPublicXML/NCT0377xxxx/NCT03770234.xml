  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics (i.e. the uptake,
      distribution and elimination from the body) of dermally applied buprenorphine during and
      after different application periods, i.e., a 96-hour and a 72-hour application of the
      Transtec (Registered Trademark) patch (release rate 35 micrograms per hour [µg/hour]). In the
      Transtec summary of product characteristics (prescribing information for the physician), the
      wearing time per patch is restricted to three days (72 hours) after which the patch has to be
      replaced. However, market experience has shown that the Transtec patches are sometimes worn
      for a period longer than three days, i.e. they sometimes happen to be only replaced every
      four days. There was currently no data available as how to evaluate this longer wearing
      period.

    <description>Maximum observed plasma concentration of the measured concentration-time profile. Blood samples will be taken for the determination of buprenorphine plasma concentrations at distinct time points: Before application to 144 hours after patch application. If the patch was applied for 96 hours, additional samples were taken at 156 and 168 hours after application. For the analysis of buprenorphine in human plasma, a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)-method will be used.</description>
