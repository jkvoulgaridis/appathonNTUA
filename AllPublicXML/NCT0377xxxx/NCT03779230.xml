    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy profile of the
      antibody-cytokine fusion protein L19TNF in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
      wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse

      Phase I:

      The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate the safety of L19TNF in patients with
      IDH-wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse and to establish and confirm the
      recommended dose (RD) for phase II.

      Phase II:

      The primary objective of this phase is to evaluate antitumor activity of L19TNF in patients
      with IDH-wildtype WHO grade III / IV glioma at first relapse.

         25. Presence of active and uncontrolled infections or other severe concurrent disease,

             years.
