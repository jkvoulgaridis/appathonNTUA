  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A short ketogenic diet (KD) treatment can prevent migraine attacks and correct excessive
      cortical response. Here, investigators aim to prove if the KD-related changes of cortical
      excitability are primarily due to cerebral cortex activity or are modulated by the brainstem.

      Through the stimulation of the right supraorbital division of the trigeminal nerve, there
      will be concurrently interictally recorded the nociceptive blink reflex (nBR) and the
      pain-related evoked potentials (PREP) in 18 migraineurs patients without aura before and
      after 1-month on KD, while in metabolic ketosis. nBR and PREP reflect distinct brain
      structures activation: the brainstem and the cerebral cortex respectively. It will be
      estimated nBR R2 component area-under-the-curve as well as PREP amplitude habituation as the
      slope of the linear regression between the 1st and the 2nd block of 5 averaged responses.

    <description>Comparison before and during ketogenic diet of trigeminal neurophysiological features in a population of patients with migraine. In particular, the nociceptive blink reflex (nBR) and the trigeminal pain-related evoked potentials (PREPs) changes of amplitude between the baseline (pre-diet) and during the diet will be used as markers of ketones activity on neural modulation. The unit of measure of the amplitude of neurophysiological evoked responses are the micronVolts (1 volt X 10^-6).</description>

    <description>Comparison before and during ketogenic diet of latencies of trigeminal neurophysiological evoked responses in a population of patients with migraine. In particular, the latency of evoked nociceptive blink reflex (nBR) and the trigeminal pain-related evoked potentials (PREPs) changes between the baseline (pre-diet) and during the diet. The unit of measure of the latency of the neurophysiological features are the milliseconds (1 sec X 10^-3).</description>

    <measure>Trigeminal neurophysiological changes (slope)</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison before and during ketogenic diet of the habituation slope of amplitudes of repeated responses to repetitive trigeminal painful electrical stimuli in a population of patients with migraine. A repetitive stimulus induces repetitive responses from the brainstem and cerebral cortex that physiologically have a decremental trend of amplitudes, also called habituation. On the contrary, in migraineurs, there is a deficit of habituation, i.e. a lack of decremental responses, both in nociceptive blink reflex (nBR) and the trigeminal pain-related evoked potentials (PREPs). The changes induced by ketogenic diet in habituation slope will be measured. The unit of measure of the slope is the radiant degree.</description>
