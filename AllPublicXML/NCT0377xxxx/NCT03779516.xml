  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that use of preoperative nebulized
      lidocaine is reduced the incidence of postoperative sore throat after endotracheal
      intubation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) requiring double lumen tube
      (DLT) endotracheal intubation for one-lung ventilation (OLV) were enrolled in the study.
      Patients were randomized by means of computer-generated order randomization into two groups:
      Group C (those who received a saline solution as placebo delivered by nebulization) and Group
      L (those who received lidocaine delivered by nebulization).

      At 1, 6 and 24 h after tracheal extubation, an observer blinded to treatments evaluated the
      patients in terms of sore throat and hoarseness. In addition, Patients' satisfaction,
      intraoperative and postoperative opioid and analgesics consumption and complaints such as
      dysphagia, nausea and vomiting were recorded. Hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure
      and heart rate were also recorded.

    <measure>Changes in the incidence of postoperative sore throat</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sore throat was assessed using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), where a score of 0 represents no pain and a score of 100 reflects the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>whether the hoarseness was present or not</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Hoarseness was defined as a change in voice quality and it was assessed by the patients themselves. The change in voice quality at any time during the observation period was defined as &quot;hoarseness was present&quot;.</description>
