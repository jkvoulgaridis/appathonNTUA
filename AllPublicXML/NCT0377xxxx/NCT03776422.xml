  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Housing instability is both a cause and consequence of mental health problems. As such youth
      experiencing housing instability (e.g., homeless or marginally housed) have higher rates of
      mental health problems.Because of their circumstances, these youth also face significant
      barriers to mental health care and are therefore less likely to receive the treatment that
      they need. Mobile technology may offer a novel platform for increasing access to mental
      health care in this population. The primary goals of this pilot study are to (1) establish
      the feasibility and acceptability of delivering automated mental health interventions via
      smartphone technology, (2) examine the extent to which automated mental health interventions
      delivered via mobile technology improve mental health in homeless, marginally-housed, and
      exiting foster youth.

    <measure>Program adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Endpoint (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Program adherence will be assessed based on usage data determining how often participants utilized the study applications, and how often they completed daily surveys and rated daily tips.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Program satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Midpoint (3 months) and Endpoint (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Program satisfaction will be assessed using a self-report questionnaire that participants will be asked to complete at the midpoint and endpoint of the study. Participants will be asked to report the extent to which they benefited from the study, how helpful the mobile applications were, and if they would recommend the study to others. These responses are recorded on 5-point likert type scales with higher ratings indicating higher satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Risky sexual behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 months), Midpoint (3 months), Endpoint (6 months)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 months), Midpoint (3 months), Endpoint (6 months)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with life: Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 months), Midpoint (3 months), Endpoint (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>General satisfaction with life will be assessed using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). This measure is 5 items, with each item rated on a scale from 1-7. All 5 items are summed to achieve a total score of 5-35. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with one's life circumstances.</description>

    <description>Participants receive several apps on their phone including IntelliCare apps, which are based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Participants also receive the Pocket Helper app, which has been designed for this study. The tools within the Pocket Helper app include a crisis text line that is available 24/7, the Illinois Warm Line which is available Monday through Friday from 8am to 5pm, directions to call 911 in the case of an emergency, the Koko web app that provides crowdsourced emotional support, brief cognitive-behavioral interventions, daily tips, and daily surveys. Phones will also include the StreetLight Chicago app, which provides homeless individuals with up-to-date information on shelters, health clinics, emergency contacts, mental health services, and more.</description>
