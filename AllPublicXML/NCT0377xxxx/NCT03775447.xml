  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to optimize pre-analytical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) extracellular
      vesicle isolation protocols for increasing the detection of LRRK2 activity in human CSF
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims to accomplish this objective are:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate a series of extracellular vesicle isolation methods for their ability to
           enrich for LRRK2 and increase the detection of LRRK2 in CSF samples.

        -  To compare the measurements of LRRK2, p1292 LRRK2, Rabs and pRabs from the ECVs isolated
           using each method.

        -  To assess the inter-lab reliability of each method

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess the ability of the network of sites to efficiently conduct a study involving
           biosample collection for PD research. Efficiency will be assessed using measures of the
           time taken to meet specific milestones within the study

        -  To assess the ability of the network to collect high quality biospecimens adhering to
           agreed-upon protocols.

        -  To gauge the willingness of participants to participate in subsequent Fox BioNet studies
