        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of MS

               1. Active relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) as evidenced by presence of ≥ 1 clinically
                  documented relapse in the past 12 months or ≥2 clinically documented relapses in
                  the last 24 months.

               2. Secondary progressive MS with clinical progression as evidenced by an increase of
                  1 EDSS point (or 0,5 p if EDSS ≥ 5 at time for study start) in the last year or
                  evidenced by ≥1 relapse or ≥ GEL at MRI performed within the last year.

               3. Primary progressive MS with clinical progression as evidenced by an increase of 1
                  EDSS point (or 0,5 p if EDSS ≥ 5 at time for study start) in the last year.

          2. Age_ 18-65 years

          3. Disease duration: 2-20 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subtype of MS not fulfilling inclusion criteria

          2. Treatment with any immunosuppressive therapy, including natalizumab and fingolimod,
             within the 3 months prior to randomization

          3. Treatment with interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate within the 30 days prior to
             randomization

          4. Treatment with corticosteroids within the 30 days prior to randomization

          5. Relapse occurred during the 60 days prior to randomization

          6. Previous history of a malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or
             carcinoma in situ that has been in remission for more than one year

          7. Severely limited life expectancy by another co-morbid illness

          8. Active or chronic severe infection.

          9. History of previous diagnosis of myelodysplasia or previous hematologic disease or
             current clinically relevant abnormalities of white blood cell counts

         10. Pregnancy or risk or pregnancy (this includes patients that are unwilling to practice
             active contraception during the duration of the study)

         11. eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or known renal failure or inability to undergo MRI
             examination.
