  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have a higher prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis
      than the general population. In addition, RA patients experience higher rates of heart
      failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). There is evidence that myocardial mechanics
      and left ventricular diastolic function are more abnormal in the RA population and these
      changes occur earlier than in the general population. Recently a study suggested that RA
      patient have abnormal myocardial inflammation during a disease flare and that this is
      improved with anti-inflammatory treatment. This study is aimed at describing the prevalence
      of myocardial inflammation in patients during active RA disease flares and comparing that
      with RA patients who are in remission. Investigators hope to show that abnormalities in
      myocardial inflammation on PET imaging correlate with abnormalities in myocardial strain on
      echocardiography. Coronary CT will be performed to establish the presence of subclinical
      atherosclerosis and whether its presence affects changes in either myocardial inflammation or
      myocardial strain. The hypothesis is that patients with evidence of myocardial inflammation
      during the course of their RA disease are more likely to develop HFpEF during their lifetime.
      Although the present study will not be of a duration to assess outcome, it will provide
      descriptive data which may help guide future prospective study of patients with RA which may
      help guide appropriate cardiovascular testing in this high risk population.
