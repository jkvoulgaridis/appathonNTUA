  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal (around the time of birth) mental health disorders are common difficulties of
      pregnancy. Perinatal depression is made up of major and minor depressive events during
      pregnancy and the first 12 months after delivery. It is estimated that 11%-19% of mothers
      suffer from perinatal depression. However, rates may be significantly higher among some
      subpopulations.

      Left untreated, post partum depression (PPD) is linked with several significant negative
      health impacts on the mother, her infant, and their families. PPD is linked with lower
      quality maternal-child relationship, and this change in emotional attachment can lead to
      physiologic changes and poorer cognitive outcomes in the infant.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the maternal mental health effect of postpartum
      depression screening and intervention during infants' short term hospitalizations. The study
      is also aiming to define effects of PPD short term hospitalization interventions on maternal
      PPD follow up and child health based on well child care (WCC), emergency department (ED)
      visits, hospital readmissions, and parent's feelings on child's health.

      Study participants will complete a survey about their general needs and access to resources
      and a survey to screen for postpartum depression to determine if the participant will be
      enrolled. Based on the answers provided, the study team may recommend that the participant
      seek additional medical care, and may notify the participant's doctor, the child's doctor,
      and hospital officials if the study team believes that the participant needs further medical
      care for depression.

      Half of the study participants will receive a social work consult and treatment with
      psychology therapy in the hospital. The psychology therapy will be 2-3 fifty-minute therapy
      sessions while the child is in the hospital. An outpatient psychiatry/psychology follow up
      appointment will be offered if needed as per routine care.

      Discharge Follow Up:

      A discharge follow up questionnaire and survey will be completed on an electronic tablet
      around the time of the baby's discharge home from the hospital or within 1 week of being at
      home. The survey can be completed over the phone or it can be sent via email or text to
      complete the survey online.

      One Month Follow Up:

      A one-time follow up questionnaire and survey will be completed 1 month after discharge from
      the hospital. The survey can be completed in approximately 5 - 10 minutes over the phone or
      it can be sent via email or text to complete the survey online.

      The other half of the study participants will receive social work consult with information
      about follow up options for PPD per current standard of care for mothers identified as having
      postpartum depression in the hospital setting.

      As part of this study a review of the child's medical record, including data collection, will
      be performed.

    <description>PPD score will be measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A score less than 8 suggests depression is not likely. A score of 9-11 suggests depression is possible. A score of 12-13 indicates fairly high possibility of depression. A score of 14 and higher suggest probable depression. Positive score of 1, 2 or 3 on question 10 suggests there is a suicidality risk.</description>
