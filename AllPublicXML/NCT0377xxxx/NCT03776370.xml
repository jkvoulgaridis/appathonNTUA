  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility and clinical significance of preserving left colonic artery in
      rectal cancer surgery.The investigators will focus on the effect of preserving left colonic
      artery during radical resection of rectal cancer on anastomotic leakage and oncology
      efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators performed three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction to investigate the vascular
      anatomy, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and left colic artery (LCA),to help
      make pre-operative strategies of rectal cancer surgery.The investigators will preserving the
      left colonic artery during rectal cancer surgery and evaluate its feasibility and clinical
      significance.The investigators will focus on the effect of preserving left colonic artery
      during radical resection of rectal cancer on anastomotic leakage and oncology efficacy.
