      The purpose of this study is to investigate the cognitive performance after pediatric live
      transplantation.

      During the last 20 years, survival rates after pediatric liver transplantation (Ltx) have
      increased steadily. Today, pediatric Ltx is a well‐established treatment for a variety of
      liver diseases in their final stage. Even in relative indications (i.e. certain metabolic
      diseases), liver transplantation is a promising treatment option that actually is becoming
      increasingly important in clinical practice .

      Importantly, childhood cognitive ability is highly predictive for educational achievement and
      later occupational outcomes as well as health behavior . Current research indicates that
      liver transplanted children are at higher risk for developing cognitive deficits compared to
      the age‐matched normal population .

      The aim of present study is to evaluate the cognitive development after pediatric liver
      transplantation. The investigators expect to understand of the association between cognitive
      deficits and certain disease‐related variables, which may be contribute to optimizing
      clinical care of these patients.

    <description>Wechsler Intelligence Scale IV (WISC-IV) is the newly released and completely revised Chineseversion of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—fourth edition(WISC-IV) . A global intelligence score, the Total IQ, is comprised of four index scores: (i) Verbal Comprehension Index, which includes the subtests Similarities, Vocabulary and Comprehension; (ii) Perceptual Reasoning Index, which consists of Block Design, Picture Concepts and Matrix Reasoning; (iii) Working Memory Index, which encompasses the subtests Digit Span and Letter Number Sequencing; (iv) Processing Speed Index, which is composed of the subtests Coding and Symbol Search. The normative populations mean (M) is 100, and the standard deviation (SD) is 15 for all indices.The lower the intelligence score, the worse outcome.</description>
