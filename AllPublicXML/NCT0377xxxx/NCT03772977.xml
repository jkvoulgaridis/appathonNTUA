      6-month, randomized, controlled investigation measuring the effect of increased clinical
      contact and personalization compared to standard physician counseling on adherence to
      consensus-based, brain health recommendations for patients with subjective cognitive decline,
      mild cognitive impairment, and early dementia or patients who are at risk for developing
      these conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month, randomized, controlled investigation measuring the effect of increased
      clinical contact and personalized recommendations from a health coach, compared to standard
      physician counseling on adherence to consensus-based, brain health recommendations, including
      80 patients with either subjective cognitive decline, MCI, or early dementia enrolled from a
      hospital-based memory disorders clinic, or, with risk factors for dementia enrolled from a
      hospital-based primary care clinic. Participants and caregivers in the health coach arm work
      with a health coach within their respective practice, called the a &quot;brain health champion&quot;
      (BHC), through weekly motivational phone calls and in-person visits every 6 weeks. In the
      encounters and visits, BHCs and patients/caregivers work together to establish, update, and
      achieve personalized, attainable lifestyle goals. Participants in the control arm receive
      standard counseling and education from providers during routine clinic visits. Changes in
      physical activity, dietary pattern, and social and cognitive activities are measured using
      questionnaires validated in cognitively impaired and normal populations. Other outcomes
      include measures of quality of life (QOL), cognitive function, neuropsychiatric status, sleep
      quality, and behavior. Follow-up assessments are also completed at 6 months
      post-intervention, with some patients receiving &quot;booster&quot; encounters to assess the
      maintenance of behaviors.
