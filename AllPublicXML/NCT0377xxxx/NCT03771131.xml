  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alongside physiological cognitive ageing, nowadays there is an alarming increase in the
      incidence of dementia that requires communities to invest in its prevention. The engagement
      in cognitively stimulating activities and strong social networks have been identified among
      those protective factors promoting successful cognitive ageing. One aspect regarding
      cognitive stimulation concerns the relevance of the frequency of an external intervention.
      For these reasons, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-month
      multi-domain cognitive training program, administered once per week in a group of healthy
      elderly aged over 60 years old. Their results obtained on a series of neuropsychological
      tests, both pre- (t0) and post-training (t1), were compared with those of a passive control
      group who did not receive the cognitive training.

      Participants were assigned to the experimental or control group based on their time of
      application to the program. Both experimental and control group underwent a
      neuropsychological assessment to investigate different cognitive domains, before and after
      (~3 months) the training program. Based on the scores obtained during the preliminary
      neuropsychological assessment, the participants of the experimental training group were
      divided into small subgroups (ranging from 8 to 12 subjects) to further address
      individualization of training (i.e. level of difficulty of the exercises proposed). The
      experimental group attended weekly sessions of the multi-domain cognitive training. Each
      session lasted around one hour and the overall duration of the training was of 3 months, for
      a total of 13 sessions. To promote improvement transfer to everyday life, some of the
      exercises proposed were ecological in their nature, in that, they asked participants to solve
      tasks that recalled everyday situations (such as remembering names or road maps).
      Furthermore, throughout the training, approximately once every two sessions brief
      psycho-educational interventions were provided.
