  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of masitinib (6 mg/kg/day) in
      severe persistent asthma, uncontrolled with high dose of inhaled corticosteroid and with
      elevated eosinophil levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is known that activation of
      inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, and fibrous tissue remodeling are associated with
      c-Kit, Lyn and PDGFR kinase signaling pathways; all key targets of masitinib. This is a
      multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group (ascending dose titration of masitinib
      to 6.0 mg/kg/day and matching placebo), comparative study of oral masitinib in the treatment
      of patients with severe asthma, uncontrolled with high dose of inhaled corticosteroid and
      with elevated eosinophil levels. Eligible patients will be treated during at least 48 weeks.

    <description>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)
Type of questionnaire-description: A simple questionnaire to measure the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.
Number of items: 7 items; 1 week recall (for items on symptoms and rescue inhaler use)
Number of domains &amp; categories: ACQ has a multidimensional construct assessing symptoms (5 items--self-administred) and rescue inbronchodilator use (1 item-self-administered), and FEV1% (1 item) completed by clinic staff
Scaling of items: 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum impairment for symptoms and rescue use; and 7 categories for FEV1%). Scores range between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).</description>

        Main inclusion criteria include:

          -  Patients with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma for at least 12 months based
             on Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2009 Guidelines whose asthma is partially
             controlled or uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) / long-acting
             beta2-agonists (LABA) combination therapy.

          -  Patient with elevated eosinophil level related to asthma at baseline: ≥0.15 K/uL or
             patient with eosinophil level ≥0.15 K/uL related to asthma demonstrated in the year
             prior to screening

          -  Non-smoker patient for at least one year and with a prior tobacco consumption &lt;10
             packs/year

        Main exclusion criteria include:

             asthma control

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or other lung diseases impairing Pulmonary
             Function Tests

          -  Within 12 weeks prior to screening, patient who received oral corticosteroids for any
             other reason than to treat severe asthma exacerbation (patients needing long term
             corticosteroids intake to control basal asthma condition)

          -  Patient with history of acute infectious sinusitis or respiratory tract infection
             within 4 weeks prior to screening visit
