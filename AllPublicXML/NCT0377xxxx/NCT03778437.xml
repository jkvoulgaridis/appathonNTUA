  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although ultrasound-guided catheterization of the subclavian vein is becoming standard
      procedure in anesthetic practice, failure to align the needle and the transducer still can
      lead to possibly complications. In this study, we proposed a new alignment method, namely
      Aiming Method. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the use of this aiming
      method improved resident volunteers' performance of ultrasound-guided SC insertion in real
      patients. Specifically, residents were asked to perform three different methods: landmark
      techniques, ultrasound-guided with aiming method and ultrasound-guided plus needle guide
      techniques.

    <description>Here we introduced a new freehand method, named as Aiming Method, which facilitated the alignment of injection needles with ultrasound beams. During this aiming method, patient is still positioned in Tredelenburg with the arm abducted to 90° and no needle guidance will be used.</description>

    <description>The patient is positioned in Tredelenburg with the arm abducted to 90°. Venipuncture should occur 1 cm lateral to the curvature of the middle third of the clavicle with the needle pointing horizontally directed at the sternal notch. If subclavian vein is missing at the first try, withdraw the needle and direct horizontally at the cricoid cartilage at the second try.</description>

    <description>Subclavian vein catheterization is performed under ultrasound guidance with in-plane technique. The patient is positioned in Tredelenburg with the arm abducted to 90°. During the needle insertion, the needle is secured in the needle guidance device which keeps the alignment of needle and ultrasonic beam.</description>
