  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate photodynamic therapy (PDT) using Zinc oxide as a
      photosensitizer as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the management of chronic
      periodontitis.

      Following full mouth SRP, each quadrant will be randomly assigned by simple randomization
      using a computer generated randomization technique into one of the following four treatment
      modalities.

      Group 1 (control) - Application of placebo gel followed by sham PDT (Directing the Light cure
      device without turning on the light beam).

      Group 2 -Application of Zinc oxide gel followed by sham PDT. Group 3 - Application of placebo
      gel followed by PDT. Group 4 - Application of Zinc oxide gel followed by PDT. The procedure
      mentioned for each group will be performed on all periodontal pockets in the assigned
      quadrant at baseline, end of 1 week and 1 month from the first session.

      Clinical parameters and microbial profile will be recorded at baseline (before commencement
      of Periodontal treatment), end of 1 month and end of 3 months following periodontal
      treatment.

      Zinc oxide gel/placebo gel will be placed into the periodontal pockets using a blunt cannula
      ensuring that starting from the bottom, it completely fills the periodontal pockets. The gel
      will be retained in the pocket for 5 minutes. The perio tip will be attached to the hand
      piece of the light cure unit (Wavelength: 420-480nm. Light power: 1200mw/cm2 in continuous
      mode) and light will be activated for 60 seconds. Following this, the pockets will be
      irrigated with normal saline solution (0.9%Sodium chloride).

    <intervention_model_description>16 patients contributing a total of 64 sites will be selected. Recording of clinical and microbiological parameters will be done at baseline, end of 1 month, and 3 months. Oral hygiene instructions will be given. Following full mouth SRP, each quadrant will be randomly assigned by simple randomization using a computer generated randomization technique into one of the following four treatment modalities.
Group 1 (control) - Application of placebo gel followed by sham PDT (Directing the Light cure device without turning on the light beam).
