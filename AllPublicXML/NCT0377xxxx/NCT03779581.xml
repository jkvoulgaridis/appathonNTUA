      De-rotation Breathing Exercises are the group of spinal extension, lateral spinal flexion and
      rotational exercises performed in synchrony with deep breathing. Exercises are performed in a
      sitting position with feet firmly placed on the ground. The therapist will stand behind the
      patient with a medicine ball or a small Swiss ball for the patient to receive while the
      patient rotates and laterally bend the trunk towards the convexity of scoliosis curvature.
      The patient is instructed to breathe in deeply during lateral bend and rotation in order to
      maximally expand the chest wall. Expiration involves relaxation while returning to the
      neutral position. Later, patients are instructed to extend their back along with former
      maneuver. The backrest of the chair is adjustable and aligned with the apex of thoracic
      curvatures. Side flexion and rotation towards the convexity of the scoliotic curvature is to
      correct scoliosis and to increase the chest wall compliance and extension of spinal is used
      to correct the kyphosis of the spine with an intention to also increase chest wall
      compliance.

      Kyphoscoliosis (KS) is the dual spinal deformity characterized by exaggerated thoracic
      kyphosis and lateral displacement of the spine in the frontal plane. Scoliosis is often
      associated with vertebral rotation. Scoliosis is the term used by Hippocrates, which means
      &quot;crooked&quot;. Depending on the presence of lateral displacement scoliosis is classified into
      thoracic, lumbar or thoracolumbar. Idiopathic KS in adolescents is characterized by wedging
      of vertebral bodies in X-Ray and cardio-respiratory compromise.

      Scoliosis is clinically diagnosed with 'Adam's test' by observing a posterior rib hump
      towards the convexity of scoliosis while bending forward in standing.

      The severity of scoliosis is quantified by Cobb angle, which is calculated by drawing a line
      parallel to the end plates of the vertebral bodies at the starting and end of scoliotic
      curvature. The Second line is drawn a perpendicular to the first lines, the angle made
      between the intersection second lines is known as Cobb angle.

      Clinical signs and symptoms of scoliosis become evident during the phase of rapid skeletal
      growth in children. The prevalence of scoliosis in the general population ranges from 0.3% to
      15.3%.

    <intervention_model_description>Six of the 17 subjects visiting out-patient Department of our hospital met the inclusion criteria. All the subjects diagnosed with kyphoscoliosis signed the informed consent approved by the ethical committee of the hospital. The diagnosis was based on the diagnosis by an experienced radiologist. Subjects with idiopathic kyphoscoliosis and Cobb's angle greater than 60 degree and normal pulmonary function were included. The subjects with other cardiovascular pathologies, congenital disorders and inability to commute were excluded from this study.</intervention_model_description>
