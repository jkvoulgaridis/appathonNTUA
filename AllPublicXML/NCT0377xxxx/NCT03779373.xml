  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare a group of patients managed with a manual GDFT protocol (using the
      EV1000 monitoring device; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, USA) to a group of patients managed
      using a decision support system for GDFT guidance (implemented on the same EV1000 monitoring)
      in patients undergoing major abdominal and orthopedic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many trials have indicated that goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) strategies may benefit
      high-risk surgical patients but these strategies are infrequently implemented. It has also
      been shown that without any goal or protocol for fluid resuscitation, large inter- and
      intra-provider variability exist and have been correlated with marked variations in patient
      outcomes. Even under ideal study conditions, strict adherence to GDFT protocols is hampered
      by the workload and concentration required for consistent implementation.Haemodynamic
      monitors and protocols alone do not enable optimal fluid titration to be provided
      consistently to all patients - there must also be appropriate and timely interpretation and
      intervention.

      To address this problem of consistency and protocol adherence, a clinical decision support
      system, &quot;Assisted Fluid Management&quot; (AFM), has been designed to help ease some of the
      workload associated with GDFT protocol implementation. The AFM system (released on the
      European market in March 2017) may help increase GDFT protocol adherence while leaving
      direction and guidance in the hands of the care providers. This system can suggest fluid
      bolus administration, analyse the effects of the bolus, and continually re-assess the patient
      for further fluid requirements.

      A recent published study demonstrated that the implementation of the AFM for GDFT guidance
      resulted in a significantly longer period during surgery with a SVV &lt;13% with a reduced total
      amount of fluid administered without any difference in postoperative complications. Therefore
      the goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare a manual GDFT approach ( standard
      of care actually in the department) versus an Assisted fluid management approach (using the
      AFM mode) on the incidence of minor postoperative complications.
