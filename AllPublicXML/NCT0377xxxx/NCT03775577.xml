  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying whether metabolic abnormalities in cardiac and skeletal muscle
      in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are associated with
      debilitating exercise intolerance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to better understand why patients with heart failure have
      difficulty exercising and performing some activities of daily living. Heart muscle and
      skeletal muscle (in the legs and arms) depend on normal metabolism (the conversion of foods
      to chemical fuel) to function properly. Investigators will measure metabolites in the heart
      and leg muscles, including the levels of high energy phosphates and lipids (fats) using
      magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. High-energy phosphates serve as a source of energy, which
      is used by the heart and skeletal muscle for contraction. Magnetic resonance uses magnetic
      fields to measure the levels of these substances.

             II-III symptoms for at least 1 month,

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &gt;50% by echocardiography, MRI, CT or x-ray or
