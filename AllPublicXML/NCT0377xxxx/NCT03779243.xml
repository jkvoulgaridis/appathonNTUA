    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of sleep treatment in human patients
      following traumatic injury. Specifically, the study will determine if treatment consisting of
      melatonin and education related to sleep habits are effective in treating sleep disturbance
      and improving sleep quality in Orthopaedic trauma patients. We hope to learn if melatonin and
      sleep education effectively improve sleep following traumatic injury, and improve outcomes.

    <measure>Mean Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>9-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses clinical sleep quality and disturbances. Global PSQI scores are sums of the component scores, and range from 0-21. Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) to measure quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health-related quality of life.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is scored on a continuum from 0-10 indicating &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. Higher scores indicate more pain intensity.</description>
