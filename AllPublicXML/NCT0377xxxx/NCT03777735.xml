  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is to document the application of a human bone graft in the surgical
      repair of bone fragment detachment in the knee joint (osteochondral defect) and its
      subsequent healing process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the treatment of bone fractures metal screws have been used for decades. Removal of
      material is the major disadvantage of conventional osteosynthesis and requires a second
      intervention, with all the complications and risks for each patient. In order to avoid this
      second surgery, it is possible to use human bone screw grafts instead of metal screws.

      The bone graft helps to create a solid, bony connection. This connection leads to an
      extension, a bone remodeling, bone installation and optimal reparation process in the
      affected area.

      The comparatively rare occurrence of suitable patients contributes to the fact that there has
      not been enough systematic research to objectively confirm the benefits of the product, which
      is why this observational study is being conducted.

      In total, 20 patients will be enrolled in several centers in Austria. The low number of cases
      and the multicenter design is due to the rarity of suitable patients.

      This observational study will use Shark Screw® grafts without exception at all participating
      centers. These grafts are manufactured by two tissue banks, the Austrian Tissue Bank
      surgebright and the German Institute for Cell and Tissue Replacement (DZIG) and were approved
      by the competent Austrian authority (AGES) in 2016.

      All patients participating in this observational study, due to a medical indication, undergo
      surgical treatment of osteochondral defects using the bone screws mentioned above.

      Postoperatively, the patients are observed over a period of 24 months. In total, there are
      five follow-up examinations during which clinical examinations, x-rays and a magnetic
      resonance tomography (MRI) is performed. In addition the KOS-ADL and IKDC Score are
      collected.

    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a vertical line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extremes (0mm = very satisfied - 100mm = not satisfied at all). A higher score indicates less satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Knee Outcome Survey - Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The KOS ADL score includes 14 questions and is divided in 2 subscales, symptoms (6 items, max. score 30) and functional restrictions (8 items, max. score 40). The scores of the answers range from 0 to 5 points. 0 points mean no impairment of everyday activities, while 5 points represent the greatest possible impairment. All points are summed up. From this, the KOS-ADL score is calculated as the proportion of the total response points from the possible maximum score (70) in percent. KOS ADL Score [%] = ( symptoms pts. + functional restrictions pts.)*100/70. The percentage ranges from 0-100%. 0% means no impairment, while 100% represents the greatest possible impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC Score contains 19 questions (7 questions for symptomatology, 10 concerning function, 2 about sport activity). The lowest function level or the highest symptom level receives the score value 1. The highest function level or the lowest symptom level is given the number n according to the number n of possible answers. With the exception of question 10 &quot;Functioning before knee injury&quot;, the remaining 18 response points are summed up. This gives the &quot;raw sum&quot;. The lowest possible score is 18 and the maximum possible score is 87. The raw sum is converted into a scale of 0 to 100 using the following formula: ((raw score - lowest possible score)/score range)*100. 0 points mean the greatest possible impairment, while 100 points mean complete freedom from symptoms and functioning. The IKDC score can only be calculated if at least 16 of the 18 questions have been answered.</description>
