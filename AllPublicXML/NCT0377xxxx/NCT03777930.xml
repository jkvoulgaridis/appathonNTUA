      This study was to select 200 patients with advanced tumors with an estimated survival of ≥ 2
      months. 50 patients were randomly assigned to each group. The patients were divided into
      chemotherapy group, chemotherapy combined with thalidomide and megestrol acetate group, The
      best supportive treatment group, the best supportive treatment combined with thalidomide and
      megestrol acetate group. The chemotherapy group and the best supportive treatment group were
      the control group. The combined group was administered continuously for 8 weeks according to
      thalidomide 100 mg qn po and megestrol acetate 0.16 qd po. Calculating the sum of the longest
      diameters of the target lesions from each patient before and 8 week after treatment. Patients
      in each group before treatment, 4th week, and 7th week were observed T cell subsets, B cell
      subsets, NK cell subsets and the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Through nutritional
      assessment Table (PG-SGA), Multidimensional Deficit Power Meter (MFSI-SF), Quality of Life
      Assessment Scale (EORTC QLQ-C30), Prognostic Assessment Form (GPS), Physical Status
      Assessment Form (ECOG) and lean body mass, upper arm muscle circumference and upper arm
      muscle area analysis of the effect of thalidomide combined with megestrol acetate on the
      nutritional status of patients with advanced cancer which reveal that thalidomide combined
      with megestrol acetate may improve the immune regulation and nutritional status of patients
      with advanced malignant tumors mechanism.

    <intervention_model_description>200 patients with advanced tumors with a predicted survival period of ≥2 months were selected, including 100 patients with chemotherapy indications (50 patients were divided into chemotherapy group and 50 patients were divided into chemotherapy combined with TH and MG group according to the random principle) and 100 patients without chemotherapy indications (50 patients were randomly divided into the best supportive treatment group and 50 patients were randomly divided into the best supportive treatment group with TH and MG according to the random principle). The chemotherapy alone group and the best supportive treatment group were the control group. The thalidomide and megestrol acetate administration groups were administered with thalidomide 100 mg qn po and megestrol acetate 0.16 qd po for 8 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>2 ml of peripheral blood was taken from each patient. Flow cytometry was used to detect changes of inflammatory factor expression which include the IL-2, IL- 4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IFN-γ and TNF-α(ug/ml)</description>

    <description>Scored Patient-Generated Subjiective Global Assessment（PG-SGA）form was used in the present study. The total score of PG-SGA is summed by the following four subscale scores（A+B+C+D）. The first measurement score（A）is self-assessed by the subject and consists of the following four parts: Weight Table（0-4），Eating Situation Table（0-6），Symptom Table （0-22），Activity and Body Function Table（0-3）. The remaining three measurements are completed by trained registered clinical physicians， dieticians，and nurses: Scale of relationship between disease and nutritional needs（B）（0-6），Metabolic demand scale（C）（0-9），Physical examination scale（D）（0-24）. The scoring was controlled by one researcher (H.R). The lower scores represent a better outcome and the higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Multidimensional deficient power assessment (MFSI-SF) was used in the present study. The MFSI-SF scale contains 30 subjects' subjective feelings，such as muscle soreness and memory loss. Subjects were scored according to the degree of each sensation (0-4). The MFSI-SF scale total score is the sum of each sensation score (0-120). The lower scores represent a better outcome and the higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

The Quality of Life Assessment Table contains 28 subjects' subjective feelings and symptoms，such as tiredness and diarrhea within one week (A)，and two other indicators: health status，quality of life within one week (B). Subjects were scored according to the degree of each sensation (A 0-4) and (B 1-7). The Quality of Life Assessment Table is divided into two parts: the first part of the total score (0-112); the second part of the total scores (2-14). In the first part of the total scores: the lower scores represent a better outcome and the higher scores represent a worse outcome. In the second part of the total scores: the higher scores represent a better outcome and the lower scores represent a worse outcome.</description>
