      and without the irritable nociceptor phenotype.

      The main purpose of this study is to compare the change in pain intensity during treatment
      with a sodium-channel blocker (lacosamide) in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain with
      and without the irritable nociceptor phenotype. As this is a mechanistic study, the main
      purpose is to compare the change in pain intensity in patients who receive an expected
      sufficiently effective dose of lacosamide. As supportive evidence for a drug-specific
      predictive biomarker, the purpose is also to compare the change in pain intensity during
      lacosamide vs. placebo for the two phenotypes.

      We hypothesize that the sodium-channel blocker lacosamide will be more effective in patients
      with the irritable nociceptor than those without the non-irritable nociceptor phenotype, and
      that lacosamide is more effective than placebo in patients with the irritable nociceptor
      phenotype.

    <description>The difference in the mean value of the patient's daily ratings of average pain intensity in the baseline week and the last week during treatment as experienced during the past 24 hours rated on a 0-10 point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst possible pain).
The primary objective is to compare the change in pain intensity from baseline to last week of lacosamide treatment in patients with and without the irritable nociceptor phenotype in the PP population.
The supportive objective is to compare the effect of lacosamide vs. placebo in the two phenotype groups in the PP population. Although we do not expect a phenotype difference in the response to placebo, a comparison of the effect of lacosamide vs. placebo is needed to justify that the phenotype is a predictive biomarker for the effect of lacosamide.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Probable or definite peripheral neuropathic pain for at least 3 months (Finnerup et
             al. 2016)

          3. Average pain intensity of at least 4 and not above 9 on a 0-10 NRS during the 7-day
             baseline week (Dworkin et al. 2012).

          4. Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other causes of pain in the same area, or other concomitant pain that cannot be
             distinguished from the neuropathic pain
