      Randomized controlled trial to measure pain experience, side effects and satisfaction of VR
      following varicose vein, hernia repair and gallbladder surgeries.

      While there is substantial evidence supporting the use of Virtual Reality (VR) during
      dressing changes for burn victims, there are little information of the effect of VR to
      decrease pain after surgery. Although pharmacological analgesics are popular in clinical
      practice, this approach usually is associated with side effects, most commonly nausea,
      cognitive dysfunction, and constipation. Generally, VR effects are based on gate theory of
      cognitive load, due to the fact that conscious attention is needed to perceive pain and we
      can process a finite amount of information.High-Tech-VR devices shown to be more effective in
      reducing pain than are Low-Tech-VR systems (Prothero, J. D., &amp; Hoffman, H. D, 1995). In
      addition, studies have shown that interactivity play an important role to decrease both, pain
      unpleasantness and time spent thinking about pain, while increasing fun (Wender, R., et al.,
      2010, Gromala, D., et al 2011). Thus, interactivity helps patients to have a better immersion
      into VR world. Considering this, in the proposed study, patients will be randomized to either
      receive a high immersive and interactive VR environment using Oculus Rift Headset in addition
      to standard care or to receive only standard care during their post-operative care following
      surgery to prospectively assess the utility of virtual reality (VR) for pain management
      following varicose vein, hernia repair and gallbladder surgeries.
