    <textblock>
      This study was a 12 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial. Twenty
      subjects were randomly divided into Hydrolysed Red Ginseng extract or a placebo group.
      Fasting and postprandial glucose profiles during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were
      assessed before and after the intervention.
