  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Phase IIa, dose-escalation study to determine the optimum tolerated dose and a recommended
      Phase IIb (RPIIb) dose in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with recurrent or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have failed platinum or a
      platinum containing regimen.

      In Phase IIb, randomized control study between NC-6004 in combination with pembrolizumab
      versus pembrolizumab alone in the same subject population as Part 1 at the RPIIb dose
      identified in PIIa.
