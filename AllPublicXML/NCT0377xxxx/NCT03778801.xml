  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kinesiophobia which is described as fear of movement reduces physical activity levels and
      increases the risk of chronic pain. We consider that kinesiophobia levels were higher in
      patients with fibromyalgia syndrome and chronic neck pain so that physical activity levels
      were lower in this patients groups. Because there are not enough studies, we aimed to
      evaluate kinesiophobia and physical activity levels in this patients.

      Objective: To evaluate pain, kinesiophobia, physical activity, depression, disease severity,
      and fatigue in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome or chronic neck pain and healthy controls.

      Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Tertiary Health Care Center, Aksaray, Turkey
      Participants: 30 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (Group 1), 30 patients with chronic neck
      pain (Group 2), and 30 healthy individuals (Group 3) were included.

      Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures were Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-pain and fatigue,
      Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Neck Pain
      Disability Index (NPDI).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>4-8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Based on a four-point Likert type, this scale contains 17 items that evaluate fear and anxiety related to physical activity. A total score of greater than 37 is accepted as statistically significant and interpreted as a high level of kinesiophobia. minimal and maximal scores could be between 17-68 points. higher scores indicate higher levels of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of seven items that measure the duration of the participants' physical activity, walking and sitting within the last seven days in the metabolic equivalent (MET)-min/week unit. 3 or more days of vigorous activity of at least 20 minutes per day or 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day or 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes/week are proposed to be moderate level. Vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes/week or 7 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities accumulating at least 3000 metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes/week are proposed to be high level. Some activity is reported but not enough to meet categories of moderate or high levels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 21-item questionnaire that investigates the characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. A score of 10 or higher indicates depression. Minimal and maximal scores can be 0-63 points. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It aims to evaluate the arthritis symptoms and functional status of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome through 21 questions that inquire about physical functions, work-related situations, depression, anxiety, waking up tired, pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Higher scores indicate greater impact of fibromyalgia on functioning. Final score should range from 0 to 80.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Pain Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5-8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This index consists of 20 questions that assess severity of neck pain and the extent to which the pain affects the social, professional and daily activities of patients.Final score should range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater levels of disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for the Evaluation of Pain and Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>0.5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For this evaluation, the patient is asked to mark his/her severity of pain and fatigue on a horizontal 10-cm line with number 0 on one end representing &quot;no pain or no fatigue&quot; and number 10 on the other end indicating &quot;very severe pain or very severe fatigue&quot;. Higher scores indicate higher levels of pain intensity or fatigue.</description>
