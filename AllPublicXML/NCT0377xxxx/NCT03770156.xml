  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On November 13th 2015, a terrorist attack killed 129 victims in Paris. An emergency crisis
      unit (CUMP) has been activated in Paris in the days following the attack and a subunit was in
      charge to answer to the phone calls of victims and their relatives. The same emergency crisis
      unit have been activated for the terrorist attack in London, 2017 june 3, terrorist attack in
      Barcelone 2017 august 17-18, terrorist attack in Strasbourg 2018 December 11 The purpose of
      this observational study is to document the evolution of psychiatric symptoms among subjects
      who called the CUMP and to collect information about the type of medical or non-medical care
      they were seeking for.

      The care of the victims of natural disasters or mass disasters such as terrorist attacks is
      now better structured and organized. The efficacy of debriefing or of defusing has been and
      is still debated, sometimes bitterly. The aim of the present study is not to demonstrate
      utility or futility of such approaches, but to i) evaluate their global improvement over the
      past three years. ii) to list the type of support that the victims were seeking in their
      attempt to get rid of the symptoms which appeared after the terrorist attack of November 2015
      in Paris.

      iii) to collect their opinions about the way the CUMP (emergency medico-psychological unit of
      Paris, France) managed the support to the victims.

      Participating subjects registered on the occasion of their first contact with the CUMP 75 by
      phone during the week following the attack
