  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) is an artificial reproductive technologies (ART) in which
      cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) are collected at the immature germinal vesicle (GV) stage from
      unstimulated or FSH-primed ovaries and matured in vitro before fertilization. IVM has been
      proposed as a more patient-friendly ART alternative to conventional IVF. Contrary to IVF, IVM
      is the only ART method with no cases of OHSS reported. Hence, patients with PCOS represent
      the major target population for IVM treatment.

      In clinical practice of standard IVM, COCs are aspirated from unstimulated or mildly
      stimulated ovaries and rapidly removed from the meiotic-inhibiting influence of the follicle
      and the follicular fluid. Regardless of in vitro gonadotrophin treatment, oocytes mature
      spontaneously in vitro, hence undergoing meiotic resumption in the absence of the usual
      elaborate cascade of endocrine and paracrine molecular signals that induce maturation in
      vivo. As such, the maturation of oocytes by standard IVM techniques is an artefact that
      compromises subsequent oocyte developmental competence. Numbers of studies have been proposed
      to improve the efficiency of IVM system. Synchronization of meiotic and cytoplasmic
      maturation in antral oocytes arrested at the immature GV-stage remains a major challenge and
      is of fundamental importance for successful fertilization. High intra-oocyte levels of cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), is crucial to maintain the nearly fully-grown oocytes under
      meiotic arrest and to induce oocyte maturation. Research in animal models has indicated that
      a non-physiological drop of cAMP levels in the oocyte results in asynchronous nuclear and
      cytoplasmic maturation.

      Investigators have reported the development of a novel in vitro simulated sequential oocyte
      maturation system. Critical to success of the approach is a pre-IVM phase that generates a
      rapid increase in COC cAMP levels. Secondly, the system utilizes an extended IVM phase
      containing sufficient FSH to drive meiotic induction in the presence of a type-3 PDE
      inhibitor. The high levels of cAMP in the oocyte and the induced nature of oocyte maturation
      mimics some of the key, newly characterized molecular signals that occur during oocyte
      maturation in vivo. Technical and conceptual elements were first developed using mouse,
      bovine and human COCs. Investigators propose a randomized clinical trial to compare a novel
      sequential culture system with the traditional standard oocyte IVM system for PCOS patients.

      A multi-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial will be conducted, of comparing
      sequential oocyte IVM system with traditional oocyte IVM system for high OHSS risk PCOS
      patients (AMH&gt;5.6ng/ml). The inclusion criteria will be infertile patients diagnosed by the
      Chinese PCOS criteria, aged below 35 years, and without other known factors interfere
      reproductive or metabolic functions. 300 PCOS patients will be included and randomized into
      either of two groups: group A will administrate sequential oocyte IVM system and group B will
      administrate traditional standard oocyte IVM system. The comparison will be made between
      groups, and both groups are conducted with the HMG administration and embryo vitrification
      freezing. The primary outcome of the study is live birth rate. The embryo development and
      pregnancy outcomes will be followed up and compared between groups.

    <description>From day 7~9 of the menstrual cycle, 225 IU HMG (Menotrophins for Injection) per day will be administrated for 3 days. COCs were removed from aspirated follicular fluid and transferred into HEPES-buffered collection medium. The immature oocytes will be cultured in sequential IVM medium 1 for 6 hours (37℃, 5% CO2), and removed into sequential IVM medium 2 for further cultivation. After 24 and 40 hours cultivation, the mature oocytes will be fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Two of the D3 embryos (if available) which graded as top-quality embryo will be vitrified and the rest of embryos will be cultivated extendedly. Thawed embryo transfer (TET) will give preference to D3 embryos and carried out with a hormone replacement cycle.</description>
