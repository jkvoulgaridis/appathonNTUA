  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare two accepted treatments for iron deficiency anemia (oral
      ferrous sulfate and intravenous ferumoxytol) for efficacy and speed of response in the
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in the post-operative bariatric surgical patient.
      In this study, 104 bariatric surgical post-operative patients will be randomly assigned 52
      each to oral or 52 to a single dose IV iron treatment using double-blind procedures.

      Rationale for study: The preponderance of published evidence reports superior efficacy and
      decreased toxicity of intravenous iron compared to oral iron in correcting anemia and iron
      parameters in published trials of bariatric surgery patients. Intravenous, and not oral, iron
      ensures adequate delivery and avoids gastrointestinal toxicities, which may be especially
      burdensome in these patients who require optimal levels of energy to maintain prudent
      exercise programs recommended by patients' bariatric practitioners. Uncontradicted published
      evidence reports safety and efficacy of complete replacement doses of intravenous iron
      administered in one or two doses of either low molecular weight iron dextran, ferumoxytol,
      ferric carboxymaltose or iron isomaltoside. A common feature of all studies extant is the
      lack of reported serious adverse events. Even in patients with minimally invasive procedures
      such as gastric banding or stapling in whom oral iron may be tolerated, given the often
      present multiple gastrointestinal perturbations, intravenous iron may simplify care.

      Drugs used: The investigators propose to use and FDA approved IV iron preparation -
      ferumoxytol, administered as two doses (over a interval of 2 to 7 days), each 510 mg over
      fifteen minutes based on published prospective safety and efficacy data and compare the
      effectiveness of the treatment to the American Metabolic and Bariatric Associations
      recommended treatment for iron deficiency anemia in the post-operative bariatric patients of
      oral iron ferrous sulphate 325 mg twice daily for 6 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized, comparative double blind, double dummy study to evaluate efficacy and time course of treatment response of bariatric surgical patients found to have IDA, three months or greater following bariatric surgery (Roux-en Y gastric bypass and vertical sleeve gastrectomy) over 6 weeks with a 46-week follow-up extension. Two medications and placebos will be used with equal random assignment to both groups
Ferumoxytol intravenous (IV) 1020 mg as - 2 vials of 510 mg (510 mg IV over 15 minutes) each given 2-7 days apart.
Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (oral) tabs morning and evening.
Placebo: oral vitamin C 500 mg tabs, saline infusion</intervention_model_description>
