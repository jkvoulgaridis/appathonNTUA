  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical studies have confirmed that revascularization or recanalization rate after
      intravenous thrombolysis is closely related to the formation of thrombus, which also results
      in poor neurological function after thrombolysis. Platelet activating factor (PAF) strong
      platelet aggregation may be involved in thrombosis. Formation process. The main components of
      Ginkgolide injection (Ginkgo) are ginkgolide, ginkgolides A, ginkgolides B and ginkgolides C.
      Ginkgo biloba lactone can antagonize PAF and has strong anti-platelet aggregation. .
      Therefore, it can be speculated that ginkgolides injection combined with alteplase
      intravenous thrombolysis may improve the recanalization rate after thrombolysis and reduce
      the reocclusion rate.

      In addition, clinical studies have also found that ginkgolide injection has a good auxiliary
      effect on hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, which can regulate inflammatory factors such
      as IL-6, TNF-α and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients. Recovery of
      neurological function in patients. It is well known that TNF-α, IL-β, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, etc.
      are all inflammatory factors associated with reperfusion injury. Therefore, we speculate that
      ginkgolides injection may also regulate inflammatory factors associated with reperfusion
      injury, such as IL-6, TNF-α, thereby reducing reperfusion injury, thereby improving patient
      prognosis.

      The aim of this study was to determine the clinical efficacy of ginkgolides injection
      combined with alteplase in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and to improve the
      prognosis of patients with thrombolysis.
