      The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of radio waves on the functioning of
      masseter muscles in the course of painful functional disorders of the organ, and thus the
      usefulness of these procedures in the treatment supporting temporomandibular joint
      dysfunction.

      Material and method The study group I (20 patients) and control group II (20 patients)
      consisted of patients, aged 19 to 45 years, of both sexes, who reported to the Consulting
      Room of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction in Institute of Dentistry in Krakow to undertake
      prosthetic treatment of pain form of temporomandibular disorders with the dominant muscle
      component.

      Study group (I) consist of patients who were treated with the occlusal splints and radio
      frequency currents. In the case of application of radiation to the muscle area, the energy
      was 20 J and 15 J to the area of the masticatory muscles, the frequency was 3 MHz, bipolar
      technique, the duration of the procedure was 10 minutes, the coupling substance was a gel for
      ultrasound examinations.

      The control group ( II) consisted of 20 patients treated with occlusion splints and
      sonophoresis procedures. For the area of mastication muscles 0.9 W/cm² treatments were
      applied, the duty factor was 80%, the treatment time was 10 minutes, and the medical
      substance was 25%Voltaren gel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the number of patients applying for prosthetic treatment due to painful
      forms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction has been increasing. Temporomandibular joints
      disorders (TMJD )include dysfunction of the masticatory muscles of the stomatognathic system,
      temporomandibular joints and the surrounding structures. There are often associated with
      abnormal conditions of occlusion.

      The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of radio waves on the functioning of
      masseter muscles in the course of painful functional disorders of the organ, and thus the
      usefulness of these procedures in the treatment supporting temporomandibular joint
      dysfunction.
