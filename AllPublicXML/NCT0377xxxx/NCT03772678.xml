        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior history of major organ or systemic disease including diabetes, hypertension,
             kidney, heart or liver disease. Participants with childhood asthma are acceptable.

          -  Normal hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters at screening, unless
             not deemed clinically significant by the investigator.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 kg/m2 and 32 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Taking no prescription medications 2 weeks prior to admission or over-the-counter
             medications 7 days prior to admission. Occasional use of paracetamol or ibuprofen (up
             to 1000 mg and 400 mg/day respectively) are acceptable. Routine vitamins and
             supplements are permissible at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Able to allow intravenous medication to be administered.

          -  Males (along with their female partners) and females of childbearing potential
             (defined as a female who is not menopausal or surgically sterilized) must be willing
             to use an acceptable method of birth control during heterosexual activities including
             a condom and a second highly effective method (i.e., hormonal contraceptive,
             intra-uterine device) or abstinence for the duration of the study. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must
             inform her treating physician immediately. Males should continue with the
             aforementioned contraception for 90 days after the last dose and females should
             continue with the aforementioned contraception for 60 days after last dose.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an ethics committee-approved written informed
             consent document

          -  Non-smokers. Social and light smokers of up to 10 cigarettes per day who can abstain
             from smoking during the confinement period and have no evidence of underlying lung
             disease (bronchitis, COPD or reactive airways disease).

          -  Willing to remain abstinent from alcohol 24 hours prior to admission and until after
             the confinement period in the unit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes or hypertension (&gt;150/90 after 5 minutes
             sitting), significant neurological, pulmonary (including asthma), hepatic, rheumatic,
             autoimmune, haematological, metabolic or renal disorder.

          -  Prescription medications are prohibited. No prescription medications 2 weeks prior to
             admission or over-the-counter medications 7 days prior to admission. Occasional use of

             Routine vitamins and supplements are permissible at the discretion of the
             investigator.

          -  Any moderate or severe allergies, including anaphylaxis, to food, drugs or
             environmental allergens. Mild allergies such as hayfever may be included.

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test within 14 days of study initiation and at baseline.

          -  Consumption of caffeine 48 hours prior to start of study treatment and whilst confined
             to the unit.

          -  History of any psychiatric illness or psychological disorder which may impair the
             ability to provide written informed consent or participate in the study

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value at screening as determined by the
             Investigator.

          -  Participant is sero-positive to HIV-1 or HIV-2, HCV or HBV.

          -  History or presence of alcoholism within two years prior to the first study drug
             administration or drugs of abuse unless it can be explained to the satisfaction of the
             investigator that it is due to a standard dose of a prescribed medication and that an
             adequate wash-out will occur prior to admission.

          -  No findings on clinical examination that, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             compromise the safety of the participant or the results of the study.

          -  Blood donation or significant blood loss within 60 days prior to the first study drug
             administration.

          -  Administration of investigational product in another trial within 30 days prior to the
             first study drug administration or five half-lives, whichever is longer.

          -  Surgery within the past 3 months prior to the first study drug administration
             determined by the PI to be clinically relevant.
