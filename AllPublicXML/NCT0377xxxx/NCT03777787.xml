  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently the relationship between intragastric pressure (IGP) and reflux events after a meal
      was investigated, both in gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients and in healthy
      volunteers. Ingestion of a meal was accompanied by a drop in IGP. However, the magnitude of
      this drop varied and was inversely correlated with the number of transient lower esophageal
      sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) and the number of reflux events, both in patients and in
      healthy volunteers: a smaller meal-induced drop in IGP was associated with a higher rate of
      reflux events and vice versa. This finding suggests that a smaller meal-induced drop may act
      as a trigger for reflux. It has been demonstrated that bitter administration leads to a
      smaller meal-induced drop. Therefore, bitter can be a dietary trigger for TLESRs facilitating
      the occurrence of symptoms of GERD. To evaluate this hypothesis, the researchers will study
      the relationship between bitter and the occurrence of TLESRs and reflux events in healthy
      volunteers. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that administering bitter also influences
      the concentration of motilin. Therefore, the research team will also measure the
      concentration of motilin to investigate whether changes in motilin concentrations can
      influence the number of TLESRs, via a change in gastric tone.
