  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depending on recent studies in literature the investigators aimed to compare whether
      gastrointestinal tolerance differs between infants fed with palm olein containing or palm
      olein free formulas. Besides it is showed that palm olein containing formulas decreases the
      absorption of fat and calcium by forming insoluble calcium soaps. So it is suggested that
      intestinal flora might be affected as a reason of these specialties. This study also aimed to
      investigate with culture-independent methods whether feeding infants with palm olein free
      formula results in the modification of their intestinal microbiota in such a way that is
      similar to breastfed ones.

        A total of 90 healthy infants (30 under breast-feeding, 30 feeding with palm olein free
        formula and 30 feeding with palm olein formula) will be included. Infants feeding enterally
        more than %70 with breast milk will be considered as breast-feeding. Infants who had not
        adequate weight gain and need formula will be randomized to receive either palm olein or
        palm olein free term formula in addition to mother milk. Parental informed consent will be
        taken and infants whose parents give permission will be included.
