  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, the nationwide prevalence of overweight and obesity among school-age children aged
      7 to 11 years has also increased over the past years. Sleep and weight are intricately
      related. School-age children requires at least 10 hours of sleep per night but children in
      Asian countries are on average obtaining shorter sleep than children in Caucasian countries.
