  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for multiple myeloma have increased significantly over the last years with
      the approval of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs). These
      therapies have markedly improved overall survival for these patients to a median of 5-7
      years. Due to the advanced age, the myeloma patient collective has a high prevalence of
      pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities. In addition, the primary disease process
      contributes to cardiovascular complications. With the beginning of anti-tumor therapy, an
      increased incidence of cardiovascular complications in myeloma patients can be determined.
      This includes hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and both arterial and
      venous thromboembolic events. The detailed mechanism by which proteasome inhibitors and
      immunomodulatory agents lead to increased cardiovascular events is not established at this
      time. Endothelial dysfunction, as a possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity, is
      difficult to assess. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is an noninvasive method to measure
      endothelial function by assessing the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the brachial
      artery. Several independent recent investigations implicate that vascular (endothelial)
      dysfunction precedes hypertension and heart failure. This has been related to a reduced level
      of metabolites of the l-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Anti-myeloma therapy exert vascular toxicity by limiting endothelial function.
           Endothelial function, assessed by the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the
           brachial artery (flow-mediated dilation = FMD) decreases after myeloma therapy.

        2. Patients with multiple myeloma have a limited endothelial function compared to a healthy
           control group.

      A total of 40 myeloma patients will be examined. Measurements will be taken at baseline, 1
      month and 6 month after myeloma therapy. Patients should not have received chemotherapy for
      at least 3 months. Furthermore a healthy sex- and age-matched control group will be examined.

      Treatment options for multiple myeloma have increased significantly over the last years with
      the approval of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs). These
      therapies have markedly improved overall survival for these patients to a median of 5-7
      years, many continue to live for more than 10 years. Due to the advanced age, the myeloma
      patient collective has a high prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities. In
      addition, the primary disease process contributes to cardiovascular complications. With the
      beginning of anti-tumor therapy, an increased incidence of cardiovascular complications in
      myeloma patients can be determined. This includes hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction,
      heart failure and both arterial and venous thromboembolic events.

      Proteasome inhibitors including bortezomib and carfilzomib, and immunomodulatory agents, e.g.
      lenalidomide, represent cornerstone therapies for multiple myeloma. The most common therapy
      choices are Bortezomib-based therapy (VCD, VC) and Carfilzomib-based therapy (KRD, KD).
      Induction therapy is given 4-6 cycles followed by autologous hematopoietic cell
      transplantation. Thereafter, many patients receive consolidation therapy. In patients not
      eligible for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation, a prolonged course of initial
      chemotherapy is typically administered. The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is used
      predominately in the front line setting, while second-generation carfilzomib is used in
      relapsed/refractory disease.

      Despite their efficacy, increased rates of cardiovascular complications occur in patients
      exposed to these particular therapies. Higher incidences of cardiac adverse events including
      hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy has been
      reported in patients receiving carfilzomib and bortezomib. Immunomodulatory agents are known
      to increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease particularly when combined with
      dexamethasone or other chemotherapy. Furthermore, increased incidence of myocardial
      infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular events has been demonstrated in patients treated with
      lenalidomide. The mechanism of PI- and IMiD-associated cardiotoxicity is not fully
      elucidated. PIs inhibit proteasome activity, leading to the accumulation of abnormal proteins
      which in turn activates apoptotic pathways in myeloma cells. IMiDs bind cereblon, a component
      of the E3 ubiquitin ligase which promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of the
      transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF. It is unclear if the protein degradation properties of
      these drugs contribute to cardiotoxicity, although clinical features of the toxicity suggest
      endothelial cell injury and dysfunction. It is possible that CV events may be augmented when
      these two classes of medications are co-administered and further enhanced by the additional
      endothelial stress conferred by steroids. The detailed mechanism by which proteasome
      inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents lead to increased cardiovascular events is not
      established at this time.

      Endothelial dysfunction, as a possible mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity, is difficult to
      assess. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is an noninvasive method to measure endothelial function
      by assessing the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the brachial artery. Several
      independent recent investigations implicate that vascular (endothelial) dysfunction precedes
      hypertension and heart failure. This has been related to a reduced level of metabolites of
      the l-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Anti-myeloma therapy exert vascular toxicity by limiting endothelial function.
           Endothelial function, assessed by the change in the vasodilatative reserve of the
           brachial artery (flow-mediated dilation = FMD) decreases after myeloma therapy.

        2. Patients with multiple myeloma have a limited endothelial function compared to a healthy
           control group.

    <description>The questionnaire is comprised of 21 important physical, emotional and socioeconomic ways heart failure can adversely affect a patient's life. After receiving brief standardized instructions, the patient marks a 0 (zero) to 5 scale to indicate how much each itemized adverse of heart failure has prevented the patient from living as he or she wanted to live during the past 4 weeks. The questionnaire is simply scored by summation of all 21 responses.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 consists of 36 questions and is a general health questionnaire that provides information about the health status of the patient through 8 different dimensions. He makes statements about:
General Health Perception, Physical Health, Restricted physical role function, Physical pain, Vitality, Mental Healt, Restricted emotional role function, Social functioning. For the evaluation of the SF-36 questionnaire v1.0 you first recode all answers in predefined points using a recoding table. Then you calculate the average score of all questions of the respective health dimension, e.g. physical health, so you have 8 average points for the 8 dimensions. These 8 scores now describe the health status of the patient in their respective dimensions, which can then be assessed using comparison charts.
The possible score ranges from 0 to 100 points. 0 points represent the greatest possible restriction of health, while 100 points represent the absence of health restrictions.</description>
