  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether IVUS-guided DK crush stenting technique
      compared to angiography-guided DK crush after the indexed procedure will lead to lower rates
      of the composite endpoint of target vessel failure (TVF) at 12 months. The individual
      components of TVF include cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction (MI), or target
      vessel revascularization (TVR). Complex bifurcation lesions were defined according to
      DEFINITION study.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled, single blind, superiority trial
      that will include 35 international sites. The investigators aim to enroll 556 subjects with
      complex coronary bifurcation lesions in native coronary arterial segments.

      All patients with complex coronary bifurcation lesions suitable for DES implantation will
      undergo 1:1 randomization either to IVUS-guided or angiography-guided DK crush stenting using
      a randomization schedule blocked by site.

      All subjects will be screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria
      per protocol and will further undergo angiography before DES implantation. Data and images
      will be collected during the index procedure, during re-intervention in the case of
      clinically driven TVF, and at the predefined 12-month clinical follow-up visit. All subjects
      will also undergo angiographic follow-up at 13 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will undergo 1:1 randomization to either IVUS-guided DKCrush stenting which will be the treatment group or Angio-guided DKCrush stenting which will be the control group based on an online Clinical Research Data Management Platform provided by King Yee,,Beijing CN. The initiation of the trial is defined as the time of randomization. After study subjects' enrollment and randomization, the study intervention will take place immediately. The follow-up visits for the primary endpoint are scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months after the index procedure. Angiographic follow-up is scheduled at 13 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In the IVUS-guided DK crush stenting group, IVUS will be before side branch stenting, after rewiring side branch, after 1st kissing balloon inflation, after rewiring side branch, after 2nd kissing balloon inflation.
For LM bifurcation lesions involving ostial LAD and LCX: minimum stent are (MSA) should be ≥10mm2 (LM), 7 mm2 (LAD), and 6 mm2 (LCX), with stent expansion index ≥90% (CSA≥90% of distal reference lumen area in LCX) and symmetry index &gt;0.8.
For non-LM bifurcation lesion involving the MSA should be ≥6 mm2 in the main vessel; and the MSA in the ostial side branch should be ≥5 mm2 and ≥90% of distal reference lumen area; and symmetry index should be &gt;0.8.</description>

    <description>In the Angiography-guided DK crush stenting group, stent diameter and length will be selected by visual estimation with a stent/artery ratio of 1.1:1.0. Post-dilation with a noncompliant balloon (balloon/stent diameter=1.0:1.0) inflated at &gt;18 atm will be performed for all lesions. Angiographic success is defined as Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3, residual stenosis &lt;20%, and the absence of ≥Type B dissection.</description>
