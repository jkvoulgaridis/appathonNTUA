  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study (the SAVANNAH study) will investigate the efficacy of osimertinib in combination
      with savolitinib in patients with EGFRm+ and MET+, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who
      have progressed following treatment with osimertinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of osimertinib with savolitinib in this study (the SAVANNAH study) will
      explore if the combination will overcome MET-amplification as a mechanism of resistance. The
      SAVANNAH study will investigate the efficacy of osimertinib in combination with savolitinib
      in patients with EGFRm+ and MET+, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed
      following treatment with osimertinib.

      Eligible patients will be those with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
      EGFRm NSCLC that is locally advanced or metastatic and is not amenable to further surgery or
      radiotherapy with curative intent. The disease must have progressed following treatment with
      osimertinib. Patients must have confirmation of MET+ tumour by central FISH, central IHC or
      certain local NGS testing (requirements summarised in the main body of the protocol and fully
      explained in the Central Laboratory Manual). In patients centrally confirmed as MET+, MET+ is
      defined as a) high expression of MET (by IHC) and/or b) increased MET gene copy number (by
      FISH). Patients must not have received prior or current treatment with savolitinib or another
      MET inhibitor.

      All patients confirmed as eligible will begin treatment on Day 1 with
      osimertinib+savolitinib. Treatment will continue od in 28 day cycles until either objective
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn or another
      discontinuation criterion is met.
