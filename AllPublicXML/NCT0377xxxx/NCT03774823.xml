  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether the impact of PEMF and RF therapies is safe and
      efficacious for the treatment of pain associated with soft tissue injuries as compared to
      treatment with ultrasound, and to show the effects of PEMF and RF therapies on range of
      motion and blood flow associated with soft tissue injuries as compared to ultrasound therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study of the safety and efficacy of a radiofrequency (RF)
      and pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) device compared to ultrasound (US) for the treatment
      of pain associated with soft tissue injuries, and to show the comparative effects on blood
      flow (BF) and range of motion (ROM). Total expected duration of the clinical study is
      approximately 6 months (enrollment period of 4 months and a follow-up period of 3 weeks)
      while individual participation will take three weeks.
