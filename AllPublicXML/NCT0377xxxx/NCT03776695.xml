  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a new emerging arbovirus disease, caused by the same vector
      that transmits Dengue virus, Aedes aegypti. ZIKV is a growing public health problem, rapidly
      spreading throughout the continents since the first epidemic was reported in the French
      Polynesian islands.

      Currently, there are several ZIKV vaccine candidates in clinical trials. However, no ZIKV
      therapy (biologic or small molecule) has advanced to clinical trials. Tyzivumab will be the
      first therapeutic in the world, specifically targeting ZIKV, to enter clinical trials.

      This is a Phase 1, time-lagged, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind,
      single ascending dose, Tyzivumab, ZIKV monoclonal antibody (mAb), study to be conducted in
      ZIKV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive patients.

      Tyzivumab will be administered once through single IV infusion over 30 minutes. Total
      duration of study participation is estimated at approximately 85 days from the date of
      screening. Post-trial monitoring through weekly telephone calls will continue from Day 85
      post-dose onwards for another three (3) more months.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Tyzivumab in acutely infected
      adult patients. Assessment of time taken to achieve negative ZIKV isolation from acute ZIKV
      infected subjects' blood will be the study's secondary objectives.

    <textblock>
      Dose escalation in this study will include 28 ZIKV-infected patients in four (4) dose
      cohorts.

      Eligible subjects will be enrolled into dose cohorts of seven (7) subjects each. Within each
      dose cohort, subjects will be randomized to either Tyzivumab or Placebo Groups, with five (5)
      subjects receiving Tyzivumab and two (2) receiving Placebo per cohort. There will be up to
      four (4) dose levels / cohorts, for a total of 28 subjects. The proposed doses to be studied
      are 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg.

      Within each dose cohort, a minimum of 48-hour interval is required between Tyzivumab dosing
      of subject 1 and 2 and between subject 2 and 3, and a minimum of 24-hour interval is required
      between Tyzivumab dosing of subject 3 and 4 and between subject 4 and 5. No such time
      interval will be required for the Placebo dosing of subjects (i.e. a Placebo subject can be
      dosed concurrently with or immediately after a Tyzivumab treatment subject). Dosing of the
      last dose cohort (20 mg/kg) is optional if a trend of reduction in viral load and viral
      isolation has been observed in dose level 1 (2 mg/kg), 2 (5 mg/kg) or 3 (10 mg/kg).

      Dose escalations will be guided by review of clinical signs, adverse events (AEs), and
      laboratory tests (including viral titre data) of the prior group (up to Day 7 after dosing)
      by a safety monitoring committee. Safety analysis (up to Day 7) will also be completed for
      the equivalent dose of ZKT-001 prior to the commencement of dosing in ZKT-002 for each
      specified dose.

      PD, PK and ADA measurements will be conducted at various time points throughout the study.
      Subjects will be followed for up to approximately Day 84 safety and tolerability assessment.
      Serum samples for PD, PK and ADA assessments, and urine samples for PD assessments will be
      taken at specified time points.
