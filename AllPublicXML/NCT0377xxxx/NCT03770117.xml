    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether prehabilitation supervised by an appropriate
      multimodality team improves indices of sarcopenia in patients scheduled to undergo
      pancreatoduodenectomy.

    <textblock>
      Cachexia is a hallmark feature of pancreatic cancer. Patients with features of cachexia have
      worse clinical outcomes. This includes a reduction in quality of life, reduced tolerance of
      therapy and a poorer prognosis . Specifically related to patients undergoing pancreatic
      surgery clinical evidence of cachexia is associated with higher perioperative complication
      rates. Sarcopenia, defined as a decreased muscle mass independent of fat mass, is a feature
      of the cachexia associated with pancreatic cancer. Patients with sarcopenia have progressive
      and generalised reduced muscle mass and function In patients undergoing surgery for
      pancreatic cancer sarcopenia has been associated with increased rates of complication and
      worse survival . Treatment of sarcopenia is difficult but includes nutritional support and
      pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) aimed at reducing malabsorption. Whether
      measures aimed at combating sarcopenia can improve clinical outcomes following pancreatic
      surgery is currently unknown.

      Prehabilitation is a multimodal therapeutic regimen aimed at improving the overall physical
      condition of patients prior to surgery with the intention of reducing the incidence of
      perioperative complications. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise prior to surgery for
      high risk patients scheduled to undergo major abdominal surgery improves aerobic capacity and
      can reduce the incidence of perioperative complications . The impact of prehabilitation
      undertaken prior to pancreatic surgery on perioperative complication rates has not yet been
      investigated.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether prehabilitation supervised by an appropriate
      multimodality team improves indices of sarcopenia in patients scheduled to undergo
      pancreatoduodenectomy.

    <description>In this arm of the study, participants will undergo prehabilitation prior to surgery. This is intended to increase the participants overall health prior to surgery to try and increase their general well-being during and after surgery.
Prehabilitation is multimodal therapy comprising:
Assessment for malnutrition and nutritional support dependent on the outcome
Optimisation of management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency
Assessment of muscle mass and strength
Individually tailored, goal directed exercise regimen under the care of physiotherapy</description>
