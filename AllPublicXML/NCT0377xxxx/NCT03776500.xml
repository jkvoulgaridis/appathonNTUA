  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study
      conducted at one study center in Switzerland.

      Four (4) panels (A, B, C and D) of 8 male subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) each receiving
      multiple doses of PBTZ169 or a matching placebo, at increasing dose levels, once or twice
      daily.

      Subjects will participate in only one panel. Blocks of 4 subjects (3 under active treatment,
      1 under placebo) will be investigated in parallel. Panels will start sequentially.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial ECGs and serial blood samples will be
      collected for the safety and PK assessment of PBTZ169.

      Dose escalation will be allowed once the Trial Safety Board has determined that adequate
      safety and tolerability after each panel completion has been demonstrated to permit
      proceeding to the next panel.

      In addition, a preliminary assessment of the drug interaction potential of PBTZ169 will be
      done by the measurement of inhibition or induction of human cytochromes through the
      metabolism of microdoses of standard probe substrates

             alcohol or wine (&gt;0.5 L wine/day) or equivalent (i.e. more than 50 g ethanol per day),
             during the last month before participation in the study. Alcohol is not allowed during
             the whole study period
