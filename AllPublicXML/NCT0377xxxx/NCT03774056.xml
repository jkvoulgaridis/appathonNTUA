    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study evaluating tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy
      of HC-1119 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The study
      objective is to study the tolerability, safety, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of HC-1119
      in patients with mCRPC.
