  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to better understand what happens to the heart when the stem cells are
      injected directly into the muscle of the right side of the heart during the Stage II
      palliative surgery for single ventricle patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)
      or HLHS variant. Researchers want to see if there are changes in the heart's
      structure/function following this stem cell-based therapy and compared to children that have
      not had cell-based therapy.

      This is a Phase IIb trial to determine if the delivery of the autologous UCB-MNC product into
      the myocardium of the right ventricle of the heart at the time of Stage II surgical repair
      will provide an improvement in cardiac function, reaching growth and developmental
      milestones, and quality of life, while also providing a reduction in the cumulative days of
      hospitalization following Stage II surgical repair. Long-term improvement in cardiac
      function, reaching growth and developmental milestones, reaching Stage III surgical repair
      pre-op work-up, prolonging time to cardiac transplantation or death, and improving quality of
      life will also be determined.

    <description>This operation usually is performed about six months after Stage I surgery to divert half of the blood to the lungs when circulation through the lungs no longer needs as much pressure from the ventricle. The shunt to the pulmonary arteries is disconnected and the right pulmonary artery is connected directly to the superior vena cava, the vein that brings deoxygenated blood from the upper part of the body to the heart. This sends half of the deoxygenated blood directly to the lungs without going through the ventricle.</description>
