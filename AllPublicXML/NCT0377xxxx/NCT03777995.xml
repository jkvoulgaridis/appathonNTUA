  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People always come across with different floors which gradually affect dynamic balance.
      Dynamic balance is important in activities of daily life of all people. There are various
      reliable and valid tests for both children and adults, but no test design which includes
      different floor materials has been developed. Thus, this study aimed to describe a new
      designed balance test platform and investigate its reliability and validity in 3-5 years old
      children.

      Children whose families signed consent form will be included. Height and weight will be
      measured. Then they will be taken to the balance measurements. Design will firstly be shown
      to child and one trial will be permitted before starting the test. Timed-up and Go test will
      also be used as a reliable and valid test for dynamic balance in this age group. Single leg
      standing will also be used to investigate the discrimination feature of the dynamic balance
      tested by new design platform.

      All tests will be done without socks and shoes. Timing will be the only results for all
      tests. Calibrated chronometers will be used for this aim. After all measurements complete,
      statistical analysis will be conducted.

    <description>This is a reliable and valid test which is used to assess dynamic balance in children. There is a three meter pathway. Two chairs are used for the starting point and to specify the returning point. The test will be repeated 3 times and the best completion time will be recorded.</description>
