      A feasibility study for assessing and recording myoelectric activity in patients for early
      detection of flare in patients with Crohn's disease and differentiating the myoelectric
      signals from Crohn's disease patients in remission state and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) patients can have a chronic, relapsing course with frequent flares
      despite aggressive therapy. Flares are often difficult to predict. The goal of disease
      monitoring is to identify patients at risk for flare in order to treat earlier, with the hope
      of maintaining remission and avoiding irreversible bowel damage such as fistulas and
      strictures that may lead to surgery. Although endoscopic visualization of the mucosa allows
      in some cases ability to predict flare and determine deep remission, this procedure is
      invasive and requires anesthesia and a bowel preparation, and is not without risk. Abdominal
      pain, cramps and diarrhea are particularly common symptoms of CD, which are associated with
      alteration of gastrointestinal (GI) motility. Thus better understanding of GI motility
      patterns in CD flare and remission states may be helpful for prediction of flare for guiding
      appropriate therapy.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether the motility patterns measured by the G-Tech
      non-invasive, wireless patch system can provide useful insight for routine CD care. Three
      G-Tech patches will be placed on the patients' abdomen and they will be given an iPod Touch
      to carry with them for the next three days. Data from the patches is processed offline to
      obtain motility patterns of the stomach, small intestine and colon. These patterns represent
      a rich trove of data that can be studied in multiple ways to provide comparisons and insight.
      Some examples are the overall strength of motor activity in each of the organs, the duration
      and rhythmicity, the correlation with meals, pain events and bowel movements, day to day
      variations and their correlation with symptoms, and diurnal effects.

        Healthy subjects without gastrointestinal symptoms or history of gastrointestinal
        surgeries.

        Patients with Crohn's disease in remission state or flare state (exclude severe Crohn's
        disease due to complexity of disease, complication, and potential needs for surgery; on new
        medications 【e.g. within 3 months of enrollment】 known to alter GI motility or bowel
        surgeries due to potential impact on the G-Tech results)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Crohn's disease and healthy subjects above the age of 18 who are able to
             give consent and follow direction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients or subjects under the age of 18, pregnant, and those unable to give consent
             or follow direction.

          -  Healthy subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms or history of gastrointestinal
             surgeries.

          -  Patients with severe Crohn's disease due to complexity of disease, complication, and
             potential needs for surgery.

          -  Patients with bowel surgeries due to potential impact on the G-Tech results. For
             similar reasons we will exclude patients on new medications (e.g. within 3 months of
             enrollment) known to alter GI motility but we will not exclude patients on stable
             doses or chronic GI motility agents as this mimics &quot;real world&quot; in which the G-Tech
             patch will be used and we can learn the stability of the motility recordings over time
             in stable patients.
