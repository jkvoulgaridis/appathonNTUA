  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication is one of the greatest health needs for high quality end-of-life (EOL) care in
      the intensive care unit (ICU), especially when patients are too ill to speak for themselves
      and rely on surrogates to make EOL decisions. Yet, there is no effective nursing intervention
      designed to improve communication between surrogates and clinicians. In order to enhance
      understanding of the surrogates' needs in the transition to EOL, this study will propose a
      new theory-grounded communication intervention, Nurse-Led Communication Strategy (NLCS) and
      will evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and immediate side effects.

      The purpose of this application is to gain skills and support that will allow the
      investigator, a pre-doctoral student to become a nurse scientist in the field of end-of-life
      (EOL) nursing care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Significance: In 2014, 14.7% of
      Americans died using intensive care unit (ICU) services. It is a clinical imperative to
      provide high quality EOL care. Strong communication with surrogates is vital for high quality
      EOL care due to the fact that seriously ill patients often cannot talk, and they rely on
      surrogates (often family members) to make EOL decisions. There have been many studies
      conducted in the past, trying to improve EOL communication. Yet, evidence shows that
      communication remains poor in the ICU. To date, there is lack of evidence for a particular
      nursing strategy that effectively improves communication and the quality of EOL care in the
      ICU. The goal of this proposed study is to develop a new nurse-led communication strategy
      (NLCS). Specific Aim: To assess the NLCS's feasibility, acceptability, and immediate side
      effects among surrogates of patients who are unable to communicate in the ICU. Theory: NLCS
      is grounded in the state-of-the art framework &quot;COMFORT&quot; which has guided a validated and
      effective communication training for nurses in the care of patients with life-threatening
      illness and their families. NLCS applies 'COMFORT' into a usable nursing communication
      strategy that research nurses use the framework to engage one communication session per day
      with surrogates and two discussions with bedside nurses or attending physician during the ICU
      stay. Methods: A single-center pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study design
      involves the recruitment of surrogates in the ICU to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary effects of the NLCS. Analysis: To assess feasibility, we will use descriptive
      statistics and a COSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow diagram to
      determine recruitment and attrition. For acceptability, we will use an unpaired (independent)
      t test to compare the scores of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)and between
      intervention and control groups. To evaluate preliminary effects of the intervention, we will
      compare the pre- and post-test scores of the Quality of Communication (QOC) questionnaire,
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) between
      intervention and control groups. It determines whether the NLCS is perceived as appropriate,
      acceptable, and potentially effective. The by-product analysis uses a linear regression to
      determine which factors are associated with the scores of the . This proposal meets the goals
      of the NINR in the following ways: It provides an opportunity for the first time to develop a
      theory-grounded nursing communication strategy that is feasible, acceptable, and poses low
      cognitive load for surrogates in the ICU, and it enhances the understanding of surrogates'
      needs in the transition to EOL and thereby potentially improves the quality of EOL care. This
      research training will take place at the University at Buffalo School of Nursing, an
      exceptional research-intensive university, under the mentorship of Dr. Chang and Dr. Lorenz
      (RCT methodology), Dr. Sullivan (EOL studies), and Dr. Wittenberg (communication theory). The
      training plan will provide the investigator with research skills and the preliminary data.

    <description>Feasibility is measured by the number and timing of actual versus planned recruitment. Checklist is used to calculate the weekly recruitment rate which is the ratio of the enrollment out of the total number screened.

    <description>All participants will complete the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) at the time of ICU discharge to assess the acceptability of Nurse-Led Communication Strategy (NLCS) and Treatment as Usual (TAU) communication. The CSQ-8 include eight items assessing whether the intervention is perceived as appropriate, acceptable, and effective in improving communication in the ICU and whether participants are willing to participate if a similar study is offered. Their responses are scored from 1 to 4, and thus the possible total scores range from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>During ICU stay, approximately 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The QOC has 13 items with two subscales (general communication skill and end-of-life scales). Each item score ranged from 0 to 10. Higher score of QOC indicated a more favorable perception of physician-family communication.</description>

    <description>The HADS is a 14-item/4-point Likert self-administered scale and consists of two subscales (depression and anxiety). The subscale total scores range from 0 (no distress) to 21 (severe distress), and a score above 11 indicates clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale has 10 items with three subscales: (a) uncertainty in choosing options, (b) factors influencing uncertainty in decision making, and (c) effective decision making. The Decisional Conflict Scale been frequently used among surrogate decision makers to evaluated decisional conflict or uncertainty. The score ranges from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
