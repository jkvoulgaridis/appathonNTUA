  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize short duration and mild levels of reduced oxygen (hypoxia) to induce
      spinal plasticity while evaluating the appropriate timing schedule for this intervention, as
      well as, the effects of superimposing sessions of a therapy, in individuals with chronic
      incomplete SCI. Our aim is to establish the time-course of outcome improvement and decay
      following a single session or multiple sessions of AIH therapy.

    <measure>Change in grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately following intervention, and every 30 minutes for 5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A dynamometer measures maximum gross grasp (kglb) averaged over three attempts with each hand. The minimum possible value of zero kg lb will be assigned when the participant cannot actively flex the fingers or grasp the dynamometer. Standard position includes the participant in a supported sitting position, with shoulder in adducted and in neutral rotation and the elbow flexed at 90 degrees. The forearm should be in neutral rotation. The arm should not be supported by an arm rest or research personnel.</description>

    <measure>Pinch Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately following intervention, and every 30 minutes for 5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A pinch gauge measures maximum pinch force (kglb) averaged over three attempts with each hand. The minimum possible value of zero kg will be assigned when the participant cannot actively squeeze the pinch meter between the thumb and index finger. Standard position includes the participant in a supported sitting position, with shoulder in adducted and in neutral rotation and the elbow flexed at 90 degrees. The gauge will be placed between the thumb and lateral surface of the index finger (lateral pinch).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>9 Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately following intervention, and every 30 minutes for 5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of finger dexterity involving the placement of pegs from a container to holes on a board, and subsequent removal, as quickly as possible. The total number of seconds until task completion is recorded, as measured by when the participant touches the first peg to when the last peg is placed back into the container.</description>

    <measure>Box and Blocks test</measure>

    <description>A measure of manual dexterity that requires repeatedly moving 1-inch blocks from one side of a box to another in 60 seconds</description>
