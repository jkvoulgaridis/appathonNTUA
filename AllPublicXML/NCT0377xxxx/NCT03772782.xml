      Smartphones have become a part of everyday life, but with some problems. Developments in
      communication technologies have also improved the capacities and limits of smartphones. This
      has led to the increased availability of smartphones in daily life. Smartphones have become a
      part of everyday life, but with some problems. Smartphone addiction has been an important
      topic of research and discussion as a type of addiction that develops depending on the
      frequency of smartphone use. Researches have pointed out that smartphone addiction can cause
      both physical and mental problems. As a result of a study conducted in the literature,
      continuous use of smartphones has been found to cause sleep disturbances, stress, anxiety,
      decrease in physical activities and many diseases. In this study, the relationship between
      the concept of smartphone addiction and musculoskeletal problems and cognitive flexibility in
      young people will be investigated.
