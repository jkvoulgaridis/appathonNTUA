  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unmanipulated allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) has been an
      established treatment to cure high-risk leukemia/lymphoma. Relapse is the main cause of
      treatment failure for patients with relapsed/refractory disease or with very high-risk gene
      mutations such as TP53, TET2 and DNMT3a. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is an option to
      reduce relapse after allo-PBSCT for very high-risk disease without effective targeted
      therapy. In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of
      prophylactic DLI with G-CSF-primed peripheral blood progenitors for prevention of relapse
      after allo-PBSCT in patients with very high-risk leukemia/lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional DLI has invariably been associated with high rates of severe graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) and GVHD-related non-relapse mortality (NRM). Thus, in our previous studies,
      the DLI procedure has been modified to use G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells
      (PBSCs) instead of steady-state lymphocytes. G-CSF mobilization results in the modulation of
      the polarization potential of T cells from Th1 to Th2. In addition, T-cell hyporesponsiveness
      is induced via the proliferation of dendritic cell 2 and monocytes and the down-regulation of
      CD28/B7. Furthermore, G-CSF augments NK-T-cell-dependent CD8+ cytotoxicity. These data
      constructed the rationale for the use of G-CSF-primed peripheral blood DLI to reduce
      DLI-associated GVHD and enhance the GVT effect of DLI. To date, there is no effective target
      therapy for acute leukemia with gene mutations such as DNMT3A, TET2 and TP53 and their
      response to chemotherapy and survival even after allogenic stem cell transplantation remains
      poor. Hypomethylating agents were reported to reverse the repression of HLA molecules and
      cancer testis antigens on leukemia cells, rendering them more sensitive to anti-leukemic
      activity mediated by DLI. The use of low-dose decitabine after allogenic stem cell
      transplantation was safe for early hematopoietic reconstitution. Therefore, decitabine was
      planned to be given prior to prophylactic DLI in the current study.
