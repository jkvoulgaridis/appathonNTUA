    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate how quickly and to what extent BAY1817080 is
      absorbed (taken up), distributed, metabolized (broken down) and eliminated from the body
      (this is called pharmacokinetics). The pharmacokinetics of BAY1817080 administered as tablets
      will be compared to the pharmacokinetics of BAY1817080 administered as intravenous (iv; in
      the vein) infusion (this is called absolute bioavailability). Furthermore, 2 different types
      of tablets with BAY1817080 (Formulation A and Formulation B) will be compared with regard to
      pharmacokinetics (this is called relative bioavailability). The effect of a meal on the
      pharmacokinetics of BAY1817080 administered as tablets will be investigated as well. Finally,
      it will also be investigated how safe BAY1817080 is and how well BAY1817080 is tolerated.
