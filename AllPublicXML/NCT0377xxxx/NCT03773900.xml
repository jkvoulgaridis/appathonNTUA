  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the beneficial effects on gut microbiota composition
      and activity of the diary intake of insoluble fiber (extract from Aspergillus Niger) for
      three weeks. The first studies about the fiber have shown a favorable gut microbiota
      modulation and an improvement of metabolic parameters like LDL cholesterol. In addition to
      fecal measurements, several biomarkers of colic fermentation will be assessed: expired gases,
      PolyUnsaturated Fatty Acid, Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) after a rich-fiber breakfast (= 15
      grams) and a nutritional challenge test at lunch. The gastrointestinal tolerance of fiber
      intake and the intestinal transit modification will be also followed during all the study.
