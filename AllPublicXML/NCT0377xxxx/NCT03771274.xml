  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current visual outcomes expectations of cataract patients are similar to those of refractive
      surgery patients. Their desire is to be spectacle independent for far, intermediate and near
      vision activities. Some may have already enjoyed freedom from glasses and would like to
      continue after the cataracts are removed. Different options are available. These options
      include: mono-vision and presbyopia correcting intraocular lenses (IOL). Presbyopia
      correcting IOLs include accommodative, multifocals and extended depth of focus (EDOF) IOLs.
      In a previous study, the visual outcomes of the EDOF Toric IOL were evaluated when both eyes
      were targeted for plano and when the non-dominant eye was set for a small residual myopic
      error (-0.50 D) or nanovision in patients with astigmatism. The nanovision approach, appeared
      to provide similar binocular acuity at distance and intermediate but better acuity at near.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes of an EDOF IOL when combined
      with a multifocal IOL with a +3.25 D add in patients with or without astigmatism undergoing
      routine cataract surgery.

During the LAST 7 DAYS, did you need glasses or contacts. Possible answers: Yes No. 2. During the LAST 7 DAYS, how often did you wear glasses or contacts and 3. During the LAST 7 DAYS, were you able to function comfortably WITHOUT glasses or contacts. Questions 2 and 3 possible answers are: All of the time, Most of the time, Some of the time, A little of the time, None of the time</description>
