    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of the IPACK block to the adductor canal block and catheter
      in the pain management of total knee arthroplasty. Half of participants will receive the
      adductor canal block and catheter with the IPACK block, while the other half will receive the
      adductor canal block and catheter only.

    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure that can be associated with significant
      post-operative pain. Poor pain control in the post-operative period has contributed to delays
      in early mobility and rehabilitation, an important part of recovery that is best started as
      soon as possible after surgery. Regional techniques in general have helped manage
      post-operative pain as well as minimize narcotic use. The application of femoral and sciatic
      nerve blocks has been shown to decrease opioid use; however, they were associated with
      adverse events such as quadriceps weakness and falls post-operatively. This led to the
      development of the adductor canal block (ACB) which has gained favor for providing superior
      analgesia over opioids alone, and for the added benefit of sparing the quadriceps muscle.
      Recently, adding local anesthetic to the interspace between the popliteal artery and
      posterior capsule of the knee (IPACK) blocks have been used to help address pain in the
      posterior part of the knee that is not well covered by the adductor canal block alone. While
      the sciatic nerve block is also an option to cover this area, it is associated with foot drop
      which can hinder early mobility. For patients undergoing TKAs at UCLA, our standard of
      practice is the ACB. The investigators hope to show with this study that adopting this novel
      block will help with post-operative pain control, decrease length of hospital stay, and
      increase distance walked during physical therapy.

    <description>Pain scores will be assessed postoperative day 0-3 ( postoperative day 0 is the day of the surgery and is the first day of the time frame and postoperative day 3 is the 4th day) using the visual analog score (Scale 0-10). Zero for no pain and ten being the worst pain experienced. They will be obtained and recorded every 4 to 6 hours by the nurse monitoring the subject.</description>
