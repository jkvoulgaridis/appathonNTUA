  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been conducted to see the effects of traditional massage on spasticity and
      activity of children with cerebral palsy (CP). It is a randomized controlled trial having two
      groups, control and intervention. Both groups received routine physical therapy treatment
      comprising stretching of tight muscles, strengthening of weak muscles, positioning and
      handling. Intervention group also received traditional massage in addition to routine
      physical therapy. Caregivers were trained to perform routine physical therapy treatment and
      traditional massage at home. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire, Modified
      Ashworth Scale (MAS), Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), Gross Motor
      Function Measure (GMFM) and CPChild Caregiver Priorities &amp; Child Health Index of Life with
      Disabilities at baseline, after 06 weeks and 12 weeks of intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapy is an important component of rehabilitation regimen which is commonly used
      in the management of children with CP. Massage is also used as a complimentary alternative
      medicine (CAM). It has many types being practiced across the globe. Traditional massage is a
      type of massage being practiced in a specific society and has its own way of execution. It
      does not need professional education, training and certification so do not have any financial
      burden on the caregivers. As Pakistan is a poor country with low socio-economic status, so
      such measures of management which involve less financial burden on caregivers need to be
      investigated.

      In this RCT, traditional massage was performed on the participants in the supine lying
      position. Each upper and lower limb was massaged for five minutes with gentle rubbing in
      proximal to distal direction. Five minutes massage was also provided at front and back of
      trunk area each in center to periphery direction. This type of traditional massage is
      practiced in Pakistan population which is somewhat different to Swedish massage. In few
      previous studies effect of Swedish massage on spastic CP has been investigated with
      conflicting level of evidence. However no study has been conducted in Pakistan to see the
      effects of traditional massage on children with cerebral palsy.
