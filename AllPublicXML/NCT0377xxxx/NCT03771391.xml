  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure changes in participants' blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in
      participants with PKU when switching from a conventional amino acid based protein substitute
      to a GMP based protein substitute (PKU Sphere) over a 16 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a stepped wedge, open-label study of PKU Sphere for the dietary management of
      participants with Phenylketonuria. It will be carried out with 33 participants who will be
      randomised into one of three clusters. The total study length per patient is 16 weeks. Each
      cluster transitions from taking their standard amino acid product alone to incorporating PKU
      Sphere (at least 50% of their protein substitue requirement) at different timepoints: week 5,
      9 or 13.

      Participants will have a face-to-face clinical review at the time of recruitment (week 0) and
      at 16 weeks (completion of the study). They will also have an additional telephone review
      when they switch onto PKU Sphere.

      Blood samples will be taken at baseline, and then every two weeks for the duration of the
      study.

      In addition to these study visits and procedures, routine clinical care will continue in line
      with local guidelines.

    <intervention_model_description>The study has a stepped wedge design, which is chosen over the alternative cross-over study as it allows that all participants start on the amino acid supplement and avoids the difficulty of the 'wash-out' period being the same as one of the treatment strategies being offered.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>At the point of randomisation every effort will be made to ensure that participants are unaware of the cluster they are randomised to; this is to help ensure that compliance is not affected by participants knowing when they will start the new treatment.</masking_description>
