  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy has revolutionized the approach to a number of surgical problems causing a
      re-evaluation of several clinical strategies. Now it has become the standard treatment for
      majority of ailments including symptomatic gall stone disease, appendicitis, GERD
      (gastroesophageal reflux disease), morbid obesity and colorectal disease. All these
      developments aim at minimizing perioperative morbidities, providing rapid postoperative
      recovery and enhancing patient's safety profile. One of the major limitations of conventional
      laparoscopy is lack of depth perception. Introduction of 3D imaging, has removed many of
      these technical obstacles. In 1993, Becker et al., reported that a 3D display might improve
      laparoscopic skills. Since then, many researchers have demonstrated benefit of 3D imaging .
      Starting from this, we can theorize an impact of 3D technologies on surgeon's learning
      curves. This concern is recently being demonstrated in experimental and clinical setting with
      improvement of hand-eye coordination, better laparoscopic skills and less time to learn
      surgical procedure. Usually junior surgeons (JS) start their activities with cholecystectomy
      and appendectomy but, despite an amount of literature regarding the first procedure, there is
      a 'black hole' regarding the use of 3D imaging in laparoscopic appendectomy (LA).

      The investigators decided to investigate the impact of 3D visualization on surgeons' and
      surgical outcome during laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) performed by junior surgeons (JS).
      Operative details and clinical aspect are both take in account in order to looking for any
      advantages or concerns conferred on JS in performing LA.
