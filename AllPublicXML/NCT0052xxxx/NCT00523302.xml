      In this pilot study, the PI proposes to include 20 African American participants with
      Fibromyalgia to explore the effect of r TMS on pain and depressive symptoms. The focus on
      African Americans is due to the mandate from the funding source (internal), as well as
      possible higher prevalence of FM in AA women. If recruitment is slow, the PI proposes to open
      up the study to other groups. Twenty subjects will be randomized to either sham or active TMS
      condition. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are well thought out and seem appropriate.
      mTreatments will be administered at IOP 5 times/wk with each session lasting 20 minutes. Pain
      intensity and unpleasantness will be measured pre and post each TMS session using three
      different pain evaluation paradigms. GCRC resource is mainly requested for two blood draws
      pre and post first TMS session. The blood samples will be used to measure inflammatory
      cytokines IL-1, IL-6, AND IL-8. The main aim is to ascertain feasibility of the study and
      secondary aim is to gather information on variability in response for power analysis for
      future larger study. The introduction and rationale (including pain evaluation, and methods
      relating to TMS) are clearly presented. Use of GCRC resources seem appropriate.

    <description>To assess each participant's average Pain in the past 24 hours, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-short form will be administered. The BPI rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning and has been widely used in both research and clinical settings. Participants rate their average pain in the past 24 hours using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, where 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, After Week 1 of Treatment, After Week 2 of Treatment, One week Post Treatment follow up, and Two week post treatment follow up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the impact of fibromyalgia on each participant's function, the FIQ-modified (2002) version will be administered before each study visit. The FIQ-modified (2002) version assesses the following symptoms; physical Impairment, well-being, pain, fatigue, rested, stiffness, anxiety, and depression within the past 24 hours. Each symptom scale ranges from 0 to 10. For example, 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain, 0=not fatigued and 10=extremely fatigued.
The final score is the total score which ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate greater impact of fibromyalgia on functioning.</description>

    <measure>THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HRDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After Week 1 of Treatment, After Week 2 of Treatment, One week Post Treatment follow up, and Two week post treatment follow up</time_frame>
    <description>To assess each participant's level of depression, the HRDS will be administered. The HRDS is a 17-item clinician-rated scale that is designed to evaluate depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0-4, where 0=not present and 4=severe. Nine items are scored from 0-2, where 0=None, 1=Mild, and 2=Severe. The final, total score ranges from 0-52. Scores in the range of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression, and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression.</description>

    <description>To prevent unwanted cortical activation, Sham TMS will be employed in the Sham TMS group. For the Sham TMS group, a specially designed sham TMS coil will be used for all sham conditions. This sham TMS coil produces auditory signals identical to active TMS coils but is shielded so that actual stimulation does not occur. This approach is currently the state-of-the-art approach to sham TMS procedures and is employed in high-quality clinical TMS trials. Participants in the sham TMS group receive five 20 minute Sham TMS treatment sessions per week for two weeks.</description>

    <description>Sham TMS uses the same stimulation frequency as the Active TMS but uses the Sham TMS coil instead to prevent actual stimulation from occurring (chosen as a priori stimulation based on studies showing antidepressant and anti-nociceptive effects): 10 Hertz - Pulse train duration (on time) 5 seconds, Power (intensity) level 120% of stored motor threshold, Inter-train interval (off time) 10 seconds (15 second cycle time). Additionally, stimulation-train duration and inter-stimulus intervals were determined such that they are in compliance with current published rTMS safety guidelines.</description>

        <description>To assess each participant's average Pain in the past 24 hours, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)-short form will be administered. The BPI rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning and has been widely used in both research and clinical settings. Participants rate their average pain in the past 24 hours using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, where 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain.</description>

            <description>Since cortical stimulation can be performed non-invasively by active Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Participants in the active TMS group, receive five 20 minute active TMS treatment sessions per week for two weeks. Active TMS uses the active TMS coil to stimulate the cortical area of interest. Active TMS involves 80 trains x 15 sec = 4000 pulses per session, 5 x per week= 20,000 pulses per week, x 2 weeks = 40,000 pulses.</description>

For the Sham TMS group, a specially designed sham TMS coil will be used for all sham conditions. This sham TMS coil produces auditory signals identical to active TMS coils but is shielded so that actual stimulation does not occur. This approach is currently the state-of-the-art approach to sham TMS procedures and is employed in high-quality clinical TMS trials.

The FIQ-modified (2002) version assesses the following symptoms; physical Impairment, well-being, pain, fatigue, rested, stiffness, anxiety, and depression within the past 24 hours. Each symptom scale ranges from 0 to 10. For example, 0=no pain and 10=extreme pain, 0=not fatigued and 10=extremely fatigued.
The final score is the total score which ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores indicate greater impact of fibromyalgia on functioning.</description>

        <title>THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HRDS)</title>
        <description>To assess each participant's level of depression, the HRDS will be administered. The HRDS is a 17-item clinician-rated scale that is designed to evaluate depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0-4, where 0=not present and 4=severe. Nine items are scored from 0-2, where 0=None, 1=Mild, and 2=Severe. The final, total score ranges from 0-52. Scores in the range of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression, and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression.</description>

          <description>To assess each participant's level of depression, the HRDS will be administered. The HRDS is a 17-item clinician-rated scale that is designed to evaluate depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0-4, where 0=not present and 4=severe. Nine items are scored from 0-2, where 0=None, 1=Mild, and 2=Severe. The final, total score ranges from 0-52. Scores in the range of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression, and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression.</description>

          <description>Participants receive 5 Sham TMS treatment sessions per week for two weeks. Sham stimulation involves 80 trains x 15 sec = 4000 pulses per session, 5 x per week=20,000 pulses per week, x 2 weeks = 40,000 pulses. Time - 1200 sec = 20 minutes/ session, all days.
Sham TMS: Sham TMS will use the same stimulation frequency for all active subjects (chosen as a priori stimulation based on studies showing antidepressant and anti-nociceptive effects): 10 Hertz - Pulse train duration (on time) 5 seconds, Power (intensity) level 120% of stored motor threshold, Inter-train interval (off time) 10 seconds (15 second cycle time). Additionally, stimulation-train duration and inter-stimulus intervals were determined such that they are in compliance with current published rTMS safety guidelines.</description>
