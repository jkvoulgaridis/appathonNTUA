  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the event-driven base study is to determine the safety and efficacy,
      especially fracture risk reduction, of odanacatib in postmenopausal women diagnosed with
      osteoporosis. In a placebo-controlled extension of the base study, participants continued to
      receive the same blinded study medication for a total of up to 5 years of blinded study
      medication combined between the base study and the extension. After participants received 5
      years of blinded study medication, they received open-label odanacatib through the end of the
      first extension. Participants were then invited to enroll in a second extension study in
      which they received open-label odanacatib for an additional 5 years. Two imaging substudies
      (PN032-Base/Extension and PN035) were conducted for participants in the MK-0822-018 Study.
      Additional safety information was collected for participants who discontinued from the base
      study or the blinded first extension in an observational follow-up study, MK-0822-083
      (EudraCT number: 2007-002693-66) .

    <measure>Base Study: Time From Baseline to First Morphometrically-Assessed Vertebral Fracture</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 60 months of observation</time_frame>
    <description>Morphometric vertebral fractures were assessed by central adjudication on lumbar and thoracic spinal radiographs acquired at baseline and at Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly time points. Incident fractures (i.e., occurring after baseline) in previously normal vertebral bodies and/or those occurring after baseline in previously fractured vertebral bodies (Genant semiquantitative [SQ] Grade 1-3) (T4 to L4) were confirmed by quantitative morphometric (QM) and either SQ or binary SQ (yes/no) methodologies. A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: life-table estimates of the incidence proportion (cumulative incidence) of participants with at least one morphometric vertebral fracture were assessed at Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly intervals; an interval-censored approach was then used to determine incidence rate (number of participants with a morphometric fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up).</description>

        <title>Base Study: Time From Baseline to First Morphometrically-Assessed Vertebral Fracture</title>
        <description>Morphometric vertebral fractures were assessed by central adjudication on lumbar and thoracic spinal radiographs acquired at baseline and at Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly time points. Incident fractures (i.e., occurring after baseline) in previously normal vertebral bodies and/or those occurring after baseline in previously fractured vertebral bodies (Genant semiquantitative [SQ] Grade 1-3) (T4 to L4) were confirmed by quantitative morphometric (QM) and either SQ or binary SQ (yes/no) methodologies. A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: life-table estimates of the incidence proportion (cumulative incidence) of participants with at least one morphometric vertebral fracture were assessed at Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly intervals; an interval-censored approach was then used to determine incidence rate (number of participants with a morphometric fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up).</description>

        <description>Osteoporotic clinical hip fractures was confirmed by central adjudication using radiographic evidence on all symptomatic fractures reported as adverse experiences (excluding fractures of the fingers, toes, face, and skull). Hip fractures were fractures of the proximal femur confirmed as being located in the hip (i.e., sub-region not specified; cervical, and intertrochanteric). Osteoporotic (fragility) fractures did not include fractures with traumatic or pathological etiologies. A clinical fracture was defined as a fracture with clinical fracture-related symptoms (e.g., pain). A clinical fracture was defined as a fracture with clinical fracture-related symptoms (e.g., pain). A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: the incidence rate of participants with fracture (number of participants with a fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up) is provided.</description>

        <title>Base Study + First Extension + Second Extension: Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Measurements of the Total Hip</title>
        <description>BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the total hip starting at screening, and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (second extension study) for all participants who entered the second extension study. Least squares (LS) means percent change in BMD from original baseline are provided through Month 108 (Year 9). At Months 96 (Year 8) and 108 (Year 9), approximately 3% or fewer participants in each treatment group had BMD data, and results at those time points should be viewed with caution. NOTE: The mean percent change in BMD from baseline in participants originally randomized to placebo includes BMD results obtained after those participants were switched to open-label odanacatib, which occurred at different times relative to their start of blinded study medication in the base study.</description>

        <title>Sarcopenia Substudy PN035: Change From Baseline in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Score</title>
        <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Score is used to assess physical function in older persons. The SPPB consists of 3 types of physical activities: standing balance, gait speed, and chair rise. Component activities are timed and then reduced to a categorical 0 to 4 scale based on time achieved. A higher composite score (range 0 to 12) indicates an improved function level. The change from baseline at yearly intervals was then assessed using a longitudinal data analysis model with terms for treatment, stratum (sarcopenia, non-sarcopenia), time and interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for stratum size).</description>

        <description>Gait speed is a component of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Score. Participants are asked to walk a distance of 4 meters at their normal pace. The test is performed 2 times, and the walk done in the shortest time is used for scoring. The activity is timed and then reduced to a categorical 0 to 4 scale based on time achieved. Higher scores indicate an improved function level. The change from baseline at yearly intervals was then assessed using a longitudinal data analysis model with terms for treatment, stratum (sarcopenia, non-sarcopenia), time and interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for stratum size).</description>

        <description>Osteoporotic vertebral clinical fractures were confirmed by central adjudication using radiographic evidence on all symptomatic fractures reported as adverse experiences (excluding fractures of the fingers, toes, face, and skull). Vertebral fractures were assessed for all vertebral levels (C7, T1 to T12, L1 to L5). Osteoporotic (fragility) fractures did not include fractures with traumatic or pathological etiologies. A clinical fracture was defined as a fracture with clinical fracture-related symptoms (e.g., pain). A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: the incidence rate of participants with fracture (number of participants with a fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up) is provided.</description>

A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: the incidence rate of participants with fracture (number of participants with a fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up) is provided.</description>

        <description>BMD was measured by DXA in bisphosphonate-intolerant participants at the lumbar spine at randomization, and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (base study). Measurements were made on at least 3 vertebrae for all time points; vertebrae with fractures were excluded from analyses. Bisphosphonates are anti-resorptive agents used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonate-intolerance was defined by contraindication or history of intolerance to bisphosphonates, or physician's determination of unsuitability for bisphosphonate treatment.</description>

        <title>Base Study: Percent Change From Baseline in BMD Measurements of the Trochanter in Bisphosphonate-Intolerant Participants</title>
        <description>BMD was measured by DXA in bisphosphonate-intolerant participants at the trochanter-hip at screening, and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (base study). Bisphosphonates are anti-resorptive agents used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonate-intolerance was defined by contraindication or history of intolerance to bisphosphonates, or physician's determination of unsuitability for bisphosphonate treatment.</description>

        <population>The FAS population including all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication and having the necessary on-treatment information (trochanter BMD) was used for analysis (base study).</population>

        <title>Base Study: Percent Change From Baseline in BMD Measurements of the Distal-Third Forearm in Bisphosphonate-Intolerant Participants</title>
        <description>BMD was measured by DXA at the distal one-third radius at randomization and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (base study) in an approximate 10% random subset of bisphosphonate-intolerant participants at selected sites. Bisphosphonates are anti-resorptive agents used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonate-intolerance was defined by contraindication or history of intolerance to bisphosphonates, or physician's determination of unsuitability for bisphosphonate treatment.</description>

        <title>Base Study: Percent Change From Baseline in Bone-Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP) After Log-Transformation</title>
        <description>BSAP is an enzyme produced by matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts during the synthesis of collagenous bone matrix (type 1 collagen) used as a biochemical marker of bone formation. Serum BSAP was assessed at randomization, Month 6, and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (base study) in an approximate 10% random subset participants at selected sites. The log-transformed fraction from baseline in BSAP was determined using a longitudinal model with terms for treatment, stratum, and interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for stratum size). Back-transformed weighted geometric LS means values for percent change from baseline are provided.</description>

        <population>The per-protocol population including all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication and having the necessary on-treatment information (BSAP) and excluding participants and/or data points that represent clinically important deviations from the protocol-specified criteria was used for analysis (base study).</population>

        <title>Base Study: Percent Change From Baseline in N-Terminal Propeptide of Type 1 Collagen (P1NP) After Log-Transformation</title>
        <description>P1NP is a cleavage fragment produced during the synthesis of collagenous bone matrix (type 1 collagen) used as a biochemical marker of bone formation. Serum P1NP was assessed at randomization, Month 6, and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (base study) in an approximate 10% random subset participants at selected sites. The log-transformed fraction from baseline in P1NP was determined using a longitudinal model with terms for treatment, stratum, and interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for stratum size). Back-transformed weighted geometric LS means values for percent change from baseline are provided.</description>

        <population>The per-protocol population including all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication and having the necessary on-treatment information (P1NP) and excluding participants and/or data points that represent clinically important deviations from the protocol-specified criteria was used for analysis (base study).</population>

        <description>Osteoporotic vertebral clinical fractures were confirmed by central adjudication using radiographic evidence on all symptomatic fractures reported as adverse experiences (excluding fractures of the fingers, toes, face, and skull). Vertebral fractures were assessed for all vertebral levels (C7, T1 to T12, L1 to L5). Osteoporotic (fragility) fractures did not include fractures with traumatic or pathological etiologies. A clinical fracture was defined as a fracture with clinical fracture-related symptoms (e.g., pain). A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: the incidence rate of participants with fracture (number of participants with a fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up) is provided.</description>

Osteoporotic (fragility) fractures did not include fractures with traumatic or pathological etiologies. A clinical fracture was defined as a fracture with clinical fracture-related symptoms (e.g., pain). A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: the incidence rate of participants with fracture (number of participants with a fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up) is provided.</description>

          <description>BMD was measured by DXA for all participants at the lumbar spine at randomization, Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly intervals until the end of the study (base study + first extension-dbp). Measurements were made on at least 3 vertebrae for all time points; vertebrae with fractures were excluded from analyses.</description>
          <population>The FAS population including all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication and having the necessary on-treatment information (lumbar spine BMD) was used for analysis (base study + first extension-dbp).</population>

        <title>Base Study + First Extension + Second Extension: Time From Baseline to First Morphometrically-Assessed Vertebral Fracture</title>
        <description>Morphometric vertebral fractures were assessed by central adjudication on lumbar and thoracic spinal radiographs acquired at baseline (base study) and at Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly time points. Incident fractures (i.e., occurring after baseline) in previously normal vertebral bodies and/or those occurring after baseline in previously fractured vertebral bodies (Genant semiquantitative [SQ] Grade 1-3) (T4 to L4) were confirmed by quantitative morphometric (QM) and either SQ or binary SQ (yes/no) methodologies. A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: life-table estimates of the incidence proportion (cumulative incidence) of participants with at least one morphometric vertebral fracture were assessed at Months 6, 12, and subsequent yearly intervals; an interval-censored approach was then used to determine incidence rate (number of participants with a morphometric fracture per 100 person-years of follow-up).</description>
        <time_frame>Up to approximately 108 months of observation</time_frame>
        <population>Study was terminated early due to observed increase in risk of stroke in Protocol MK-0822-018. As a result, efficacy analyses in 2nd Extension were limited to change in BMD and incidence of osteoporotic clinical fractures; Base Study + 1st Ext + 2nd Ext: Time From Baseline to First Morphometrically-Assessed Vertebral Fracture was not analyzed.</population>

        <description>BMD was measured by DXA at the lumbar spine starting at randomization, and at yearly intervals until the end of the study (2nd extension study) for all participants who entered the 2nd extension study. Measurements were made on at least 3 vertebrae for all time points; vertebrae with fractures were excluded from analyses. At Months 96 and 108, approximately 3% or fewer participants in each treatment group had BMD data, and results at those time points should be viewed with caution. NOTE: The mean percent change in BMD from baseline in participants originally randomized to placebo includes BMD results obtained after those participants were switched to open-label odanacatib, which occurred at different times relative to their start of blinded study medication in the base study. A longitudinal model with terms for treatment, stratum, region &amp; interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for region &amp; stratum size) was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Second Extension: Incidence of Osteoporotic Clinical Lumbar Vertebral Fracture (Adjudicated)</title>
        <description>Osteoporotic vertebral clinical fractures were confirmed by central adjudication using radiographic evidence on all symptomatic fractures reported as adverse experiences (excluding fractures of the fingers, toes, face, and skull). Vertebral fractures were assessed for all lumbar vertebral levels (L1 to L5). Osteoporotic (fragility) fractures did not include fractures with traumatic or pathological etiologies. A clinical fracture was defined as a fracture with clinical fracture-related symptoms (e.g., pain). A time-to-event methodology was used to evaluate results: the incidence of participants in the second extension study with osteoporotic vertebral clinical fractures is provided. Due to early termination of the study, the cumulative incidence using a time-to-event methodology was not assessed across base and extension studies.</description>

        <title>Imaging Substudy PN032-Base: Percent Change From Baseline in Cortical vBMD of the Total Hip Using Quantitative Computed Tomography</title>
        <description>Compartment-specific effects of osteoporosis were assessed by measuring cortical vBMD at the total hip using quantitative computed tomography. The percent change from baseline at Month 24 was then assessed using a longitudinal data analysis model including terms for treatment, stratum (prior vertebral fracture [yes/no]) and interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for stratum size).</description>

          <title>Imaging Substudy PN032-Base: Percent Change From Baseline in BSAP After Log-Transformation</title>
          <description>BSAP is an enzyme produced by matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts during the synthesis of collagenous bone matrix (type 1 collagen) used as a biochemical marker of bone formation. Serum BSAP was assessed at baseline and Month 24 in an approximate 10% random subset participants at selected sites in the P018 base study who were additionally included in the imaging substudy PN032-base study. The log-transformed fraction from baseline in BSAP was determined using a longitudinal model with terms for treatment, stratum, and interaction between treatment and time as fixed effects (LS means weighted for stratum size). Back-transformed weighted geometric LS means values for percent change from baseline are provided.</description>
          <population>The per-protocol population including all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study medication and having the necessary on-treatment information (BSAP) and excluding participants and/or data points that represent clinically important deviations from the protocol-specified criteria was used for analysis (PN032-Base).</population>

        <title>Base Study + First Extension: Incidence Rate of Atypical Femoral Shaft Fractures Confirmed by Adjudication</title>
        <description>Atypical subtrochanteric/diaphyseal femoral fractures (AFF) are an uncommon type of low-energy (eg, osteoporotic) femoral shaft fracture of unclear causation infrequently reported in osteoporotic persons treated with long-term anti-resorptive therapy (eg, bisphosphonates). All femoral (femur, femur-distal, femur-shaft) fractures in the base study + first extension were adjudicated against both ASBMR 2010 &amp; 2013 criteria. All 5 major features (ie, location along femoral shaft, no/minimal trauma, transverse/short oblique fracture, non-comminuted, complete/incomplete fracture) were required for ASBMR 2010 AFF case definition; while 4 of 5 major features (ie, no/minimal trauma, substantially transverse orientation at cortical origin with possible oblique orientation medially, non-comminuted/minimally comminuted, complete/incomplete fracture, localized periosteal reaction of lateral cortex) with requirement for location along femoral shaft were required for ASBMR 2013 AFF case definition.</description>
