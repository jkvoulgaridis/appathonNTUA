    <textblock>
      High blood pressure affects nearly one third of all individuals in the United States. It is
      believed that genetic factors may predispose some people to develop this disease. This study
      will identify and characterize variations in three genes known to play a part in the
      development of high blood pressure.

      High blood pressure is one of the most common health problems in this country. It can be
      caused by many factors, including stress, diet, diabetes, kidney disease, or obesity. In many
      people, there is no identifiable cause for their high blood pressure. If high blood pressure
      goes untreated, it can lead to heart failure, kidney failure, or stroke. Previous studies
      have shown that variations in three genes in chromosome 1—ATP1B1, RGS5, and SELE—cause some
      people to be more susceptible to developing high blood pressure. All three of these genes are
      involved in the development of proteins that play a role in regulating blood pressure, but it
      is not known exactly how variations in these genes affect blood pressure levels. This study
      will examine previously collected genetic samples from participants in two studies, the
      GenNet study and the Heredity and Phenotype Interaction (HAPI) Heart study. Study researchers
      will analyze the samples to identify and characterize variations in the ATP1B1, RGS5, and
      SELE genes. Results from this study may lead to more effective diagnostic and treatment
      options for people with high blood pressure.

      For each subject, blood and urine samples were collected at various time points during for
      interventions designed to study cardiovascular biology, including (1) a high-fat challenge,
      after which we measured the post-prandial excursion in triglycerides; (2) a cold pressor
      stress test (CPT), for which we measured changes in blood pressure and endothelial function;
      (3) a dietary salt intervention, involving 6-day ingestion of a high-salt diet, followed by
      6-day ingestion of a low-salt diet, during which we measured changes in blood pressure; and
      (4) 14 days of low-dose aspirin therapy, during which we measured changes in platelet
      function. The exact protocol is published in the American Heart Journal, Volume 155, Issue 5,
      May 2008, pages 823-828.
