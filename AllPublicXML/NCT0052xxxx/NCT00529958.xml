  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the difference in quality of
      life outcome at two years, in patients undergoing an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)
      reconstruction procedure with either a patellar tendon, quadruple hamstring tendon or a
      double-bundle hamstring tendon autograft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an ACL injury, the knee is predisposed to chronic instability, further damage to
      the meniscal and chondral structures in the knee, osteoarthritis and an impaired quality of
      life. The successful treatment of an ACL deficient knee aims to preserve the intact meniscus
      and chondral structures, and to provide a functionally stable knee so that patients can
      return to pre-injury activities and restore their quality of life. The current standard of
      care for ACL deficient knees is with a surgical ACL reconstruction procedure. A Cochrane
      Review was done and demonstrated that the existing literature is controversial. To date, no
      existing trial has used validated patient-based outcome assessment, accounted for the
      critical differences between acute and chronic ACL deficiency or used modern techniques to
      ensure randomization concealment and a sufficient sample size to avoid type II error. The
      existing information does not define graft failure or re-ruptures, involve long-term
      follow-up to address osteoarthritis development, nor compare outcomes between single- and
      double-bundle reconstructive techniques. The current standard includes either a patellar
      tendon or quadruple semitendinosus/gracilis tendon autograft reconstruction. The newest
      option is a double-bundle semitendinosus/gracilis graft. This option attempts to restore the
      complex ACL anatomy by using two separate tendon components to reconstruct the ACL. This
      study will measure disease-specific quality of life at short- and long-term post-operative
      intervals (1, 2, 5 and 10 years). Additional secondary outcomes, including the incidence of
      traumatic re-ruptures and graft failures, will also be compared between treatment groups.

    <description>The 32-item patient-reported Anterior Cruciate Ligament Quality-of-Life (ACL-QOL) questionnaire assesses symptoms/physical complaints, work-related, sports/recreational, lifestyle and social/emotional concerns. A higher score on the 0 to 100mm visual analog scale represents better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Traumatic ACL Re-ruptures and Atraumatic Graft Failures</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 2-year Follow-up, and 5-Year Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>COMPLETE TRAUMATIC RE-RUPTURE - defined as a consequence of an acute traumatic event resulting in a change in static stability since the most recent follow-up visit; determined clinically by a definite loss of end point on Lachman testing, increased anterior translation (&gt;3mm) and a greater than or equal grade 2 pivot shift. Confirmed by MRI or diagnostic arthroscopy.
PARTIAL TRAUMATIC TEARS - defined as a consequence of an acute traumatic event resulting in a suspected meniscal injury or graft tear on history, without the clinical characteristics of a &quot;complete traumatic rerupture&quot;. Confirmed by MR or diagnostic arthroscopy.
TRAUMATIC RE-INJURY - combined total of &quot;complete traumatic re-ruptures&quot; and &quot;partial traumatic tears&quot;.
ATRAUMATIC GRAFT FAILURES - defined in the absence of an acute traumatic event, with greater than or equal grade 2 pivot shift and/or greater than or equal to 6mm side-to-side difference on the KT arthrometer.</description>

        <description>COMPLETE TRAUMATIC RE-RUPTURE - defined as a consequence of an acute traumatic event resulting in a change in static stability since the most recent follow-up visit; determined clinically by a definite loss of end point on Lachman testing, increased anterior translation (&gt;3mm) and a greater than or equal grade 2 pivot shift. Confirmed by MRI or diagnostic arthroscopy.
PARTIAL TRAUMATIC TEARS - defined as a consequence of an acute traumatic event resulting in a suspected meniscal injury or graft tear on history, without the clinical characteristics of a &quot;complete traumatic rerupture&quot;. Confirmed by MR or diagnostic arthroscopy.
TRAUMATIC RE-INJURY - combined total of &quot;complete traumatic re-ruptures&quot; and &quot;partial traumatic tears&quot;.
ATRAUMATIC GRAFT FAILURES - defined in the absence of an acute traumatic event, with greater than or equal grade 2 pivot shift and/or greater than or equal to 6mm side-to-side difference on the KT arthrometer.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Each Pivot Shift Grade</title>
        <description>The Pivot Shift test is a dynamic, passive test to assess the rotational instability of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament in the knee.
Pivot shift grades include: equal/0 (negative); glide/1; clunk/2; gross/3. A positive grade indicates injury to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament.</description>
