    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well dalteparin works in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (blood
      clots) in participants with cancer. Dalteparin is a blood thinner that can treat blood clots
      and may prevent them from forming.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of dalteparin as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
      in orthopedic oncology patients.

      II. To determine whether there are significantly increased bleeding complications at the
      surgical site after major oncologic operations in the lower extremity.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive dalteparin subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) starting 12-24 hours
      after surgery on post-operative day 1 until hospital discharge, about 7-10 days.
