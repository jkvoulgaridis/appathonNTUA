  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if giving women a hormone called &quot;ghrelin&quot; will
      increase levels of growth hormone in the blood and increase appetite. Ghrelin is a naturally
      occurring hormone that is produced mostly by the stomach and causes secretion of another
      hormone called growth hormone. It also increases short-term appetite and may lower the amount
      of inflammation in the body.

      Some people lose their appetite as they age and have unintentional weight loss. This may be
      caused by a break in the communication between the stomach and the brain. We are particularly
      interested in seeing if there is a difference in the effects of ghrelin in older women who
      have lost weight recently without wanting to and those who have not.

    <textblock>
      Five community-dwelling women aged 70 or over with unintentional weight loss of &gt;5% in the
      prior year plus at least 2 of the 4 remaining Fried criteria for frailty and five healthy
      women without any frailty criteria were enrolled. Women with conditions that can cause weight
      loss or taking an appetite stimulant or corticosteroids were excluded. Each woman completed
      two 180 minute infusions, one week apart, assigned randomly: a graded ghrelin infusion of
      2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes each and an equivalent placebo (saline)
      infusion. A meal of standardized composition was provided after each infusion and intake
      quantified. Samples were collected every 30 minutes for growth hormone (GH), and total and
      active ghrelin. Additional samples were collected every 60 minutes for glucose, insulin, free
      fatty acids, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists
      (GLP-1), and cortisol. Adverse events were collected during the infusion and by telephone 24
      hours later. Non-parametric methods were used to compare differences in response to the
      ghrelin and placebo infusions 1) in all women and 2) between frail and healthy women.
