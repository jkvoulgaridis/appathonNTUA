  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, conducted at the NIH Clinical Research Unit at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center,
      will examine how the body s metabolism (energy expenditure) changes when people overeat and
      when they fast and how different diets (e.g., high-protein or high-fat) affect metabolism.
      The results may provide information about whether there are mechanisms that make some people
      more resistant than others to gaining weight when they eat more.

      Non-smoking healthy subjects between 18 and 55 years of age who weigh no more than 350 pounds
      may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, an I.V. line (needle attached to a plastic
           tube) is inserted into a vein to allow several blood draws without repeated needle
           sticks. After the first blood sample is drawn, the subject drinks a cola-flavored sugar
           solution. Five additional blood samples are then drawn over 3 hours.

        -  Blood test for DNA (genetic) studies related to obesity, diabetes and related medical
           problems.

        -  DEXA scan. This test measures body fat. The subject lies on a table while a very small
           dose of X-rays is passed through the body.

        -  Respiratory chamber. This test measures how many calories the body burns a day and
           assesses energy balance between intake and expenditure. Subjects stay in a room with two
           windows, equipped with a sink, toilet, television and DVD player, desk, chair, telephone
           and bed for 24 hours. The test is repeated five times during the first 18-day admission
           and 3 times during the second 13-day admission. For the first two sessions, subjects are
           fed a diet equal to the amount of energy their body uses. For the next 6 stays they are
           fed double the amount of calories their body usually uses for 5 of the stays and fast
           (consume nothing but water and soda without caffeine or calories) during 1 stay. The
           overfeeding diets may be high or low in protein, normal in protein, or high in fat.
           Blood tests are done on the day of each respiratory chamber session and a 24-hour urine
           sample is collected for one day while in the chamber.

        -  Eating behavior questionnaires.

        -  Psychological performance tests.

      Some participants are asked to volunteer to repeat two of the chamber studies to validate the
      measurements. The repeat session includes only the fasting and the overfeeding with normal
      protein content.

      All participants are followed at 6 months with blood tests, a DEXA scan, and urine tests
      (including pregnancy test for women). At annual visits for years 1 through 7, participants
      have the 6-month tests plus an oral glucose tolerance test.

      Some people appear to be more resistant than others to gaining weight when they overeat,
      though they do not increase their physical activity. This may indicate that adaptive
      mechanisms exist, which lead to wasting as heat part of the excess calories taken in. Such
      mechanisms exist in rodents including activation of brown fat, a tissue which can also
      convert calories to heat for warmth. Human studies have provided conflicting results. A pilot
      study on the relationship of the weight change over time with the changes in the amount of
      energy an individual uses over 24 hours (energy expenditure, EE) with 48-h overfeeding (OF)
      and fasting (F) in Pima Indian men has shown that persons with the greatest increase in EE
      with OF and the smallest decrease in EE with F gained the least weight over time, indicating
      that the ability to waste more calories when overfed may reduce weight gain. Other studies,
      however, have not shown this relationship. In addition, it has been proposed that unbalanced
      diets can help magnify these effects. The aims of this study are to test whether (a) the
      changes in EE in response to 24-h OF and F predict changes in weight over two years, and (b)
      high-carbohydrate diets or diets with high or low protein amounts may magnify the metabolic
      response to 24-h OF compared to normal protein and high-fat diets. 64 volunteers will be
      evaluated at baseline, 6 months and on a yearly basis for up to 7 years. At baseline,
      subjects will undergo 8 24-h sessions in a human respiratory chamber to measure EE while on a
      weight-maintaining diet, and then in random order: fasting, 200% OF on a normal-protein diet,
      200% OF on a high fat, low-protein diet, 200% OF on a high-fat, normal-protein diet, 200% OF
      on a high fat, high protein diet, and 200% OF on a high-carbohydrate, normal-protein diet.
      Twenty volunteers will have two additional chambers to try to understand what influences how
      a person responds to overeating. Fifteen volunteers will have two additional chambers to try
      and understand if the source of carbohydrates, i.e. simple sugars versus complex
      carbohydrates, in a high carbohydrate diet affect metabolism. Thirty volunteers will also
      undergo 2 positron emission tomography (PET) studies to look at the relationship of brown fat
      with EE in adult humans. Body weight and composition will be measured at each subsequent
      admission. Hormonal measurements to find determinants of adaptive changes in EE in response
      to OF and F will also be performed. This study will provide significant insights into
      possible mechanisms that may help people resist weight gain and obesity.

        -  Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 18-55 years, to exclude effects of aging on energy expenditure and weight change.
             For the PET-CT substudy, women will be limited to ages 18-40 years because there is a
             high likelihood that for women greater than 40 years, their personal physician may
             recommend an annual routine mammogram, thereby increasing their annual radiation
             exposure. Men will also be limited to this age range to prevent age discrepancies
             between men and women for this substudy.

          -  Premenopausal

          -  Weight: less than or equal to 450 lb (maximum weight allowed on the DXA scanning
             tables by the manufacturer).

          -  Only men with a percent body fat less than 25% and women with a percent body fat less
             than 33% will be eligible for the thermic effect of food (TEF) substudy as this
             substudy is designed to assess the effect of body core insulation in lean individuals.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History or clinical manifestation of:

          -  Current smoking

          -  Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), type 1 and type 2 diabetes

             hyperthyroidism

          -  Pulmonary disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which would
             limit ability to follow the protocol (investigator judgment)

          -  Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias,
             and peripheral artery disease

          -  Hypertension, as diagnosed and treated by an outside physician or by sitting blood
             pressure measurement, using an appropriate cuff, higher than 140/90 mmHg on two or
             more occasions

          -  Liver disease, including cirrhosis, active hepatitis B or C, and AST or ALT greater
             than or equal to 3 times normal

             mg/dl and/or proteinuria greater than 300 mg/day (200 (Micro)g/min)

          -  Central nervous system disease, including previous history of cerebrovascular
             accidents, dementia, and neurodegenerative disorders

          -  Cancer requiring treatment in the past five years, except for non-melanoma skin
             cancers or cancers that have clearly been cured or in the opinion of the investigator
             carry an excellent prognosis (e.g., Stage 1 cervical cancer).

          -  Infectious disease such as active tuberculosis, HIV (by self-report), chronic
             coccidiomycoses or other chronic infections that might influence weight.

          -  Conditions not specifically mentioned above may serve as criteria for exclusion at the
             discretion of the investigators

          -  Alcohol and/or drug abuse (more than 3 drinks per day and use of drugs, such as
             amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, or marijuana).

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  For the PET-CT substudy, radiation exposure to the torso for research or medical
             purposes within the past 12 months

             contraindication to propranolol ingestion including asthma or bradycardia.

        Prior to beginning any of the study procedures, all subjects will be fully informed of the
        aim, nature, and risks of the study prior to giving written informed consent. The study s
        informed consent will be obtained by a principal or associate investigator, research
        physician or physician assistant working in the clinical research unit.
