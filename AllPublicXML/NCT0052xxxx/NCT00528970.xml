  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different dose regimens (12
      milligrams [mg] and 24 mg) of IV MOA-728 versus placebo in shortening the time to return of
      bowel function in participants receiving opioid analgesia administered via patient-controlled
      anesthesia (PCA), and who had undergone repair of large (greater than or equal to [â‰¥]10
      centimeters) ventral hernias with or without a mesh prosthesis via laparotomy or laparoscopy.

    <measure>Time to First Bowel Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (From the time of end of surgery [that is; from the first dose of study drug administration]) up to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first bowel movement was measured from the end of surgery (defined as the time when the last skin suture or staple was placed in the participant). Time of the first bowel movement was recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The first bowel movement was defined as a normal stool for a postoperative participant based on the clinical judgment of the investigator or designee. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier estimate. Participants who had a bowel movement but were readmitted to the hospital within 1 week after discharge with a diagnosis of postoperative ileus (POI) were considered censored at the time of the first bowel movement as if the bowel movement had not occurred.</description>

    <measure>Time to Discharge Eligibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (From the time of end of surgery [that is; from the first dose of study drug administration]) up to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Time to discharge eligibility was measured from the end of surgery (defined as the time when the last skin suture or staple was placed in the participant). Discharge eligibility was defined as tolerance of oral intake of liquids greater than (&gt;) 500 milliliters (mL) per 8 hours without nausea or retching/vomiting. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier estimate.</description>

    <measure>Time to Discharge Order Written From the End of Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (From the time of end of surgery [that is; from the first dose of study drug administration]) up to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or designee recorded the time of the order. Participants re-admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of POI within 7 days after discharge was considered treatment failures. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier estimate.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Events (CMEs) for Nausea or Retching/Vomiting at Day 2 (24 Hours) as Evaluated by the Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>CMEs were defined using opioid-related SDS (assessed participant-reported levels of severity concerning 10 symptoms associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion and retching/vomiting). CME = any symptom rated as severe (3) or very severe (4), with the exception of confusion. A total CME score was calculated by summing the number of CMEs across symptoms and ranged from 0 to 9. CME was counted for either nausea or vomiting/retching, or both and reported in this outcome measure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Postoperative participants (who had undergone repair of large [at least 10 centimeters] ventral hernias, with or without mesh prosthesis via laparotomy or laparoscopy) were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to either MOA-728 24 mg, MOA-728 12 mg, or placebo treatment groups.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were prospectively stratified by type of surgery (laparotomy or laparoscopy) and geographic region.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>MOA-728 12 mg</title>
          <description>Participants received methylnaltrexone (MOA-728) 12 milligrams (mg) as an intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 20 minutes for approximately every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses in 24-hour period. The first dose of study drug was administered within approximately 90 minutes after completion of the surgical procedure (defined as the time when the last skin suture or staple was placed in the participant). Dose administration was continued for a maximum of 10 days.</description>

          <description>Participants received MOA-728 24 mg as an IV infusion over approximately 20 minutes for approximately every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses in 24-hour period. The first dose of study drug was administered within approximately 90 minutes after completion of the surgical procedure (defined as the time when the last skin suture or staple was placed in the participant). Dose administration was continued for a maximum of 10 days.</description>

        <description>Time to first bowel movement was measured from the end of surgery (defined as the time when the last skin suture or staple was placed in the participant). Time of the first bowel movement was recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The first bowel movement was defined as a normal stool for a postoperative participant based on the clinical judgment of the investigator or designee. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier estimate. Participants who had a bowel movement but were readmitted to the hospital within 1 week after discharge with a diagnosis of postoperative ileus (POI) were considered censored at the time of the first bowel movement as if the bowel movement had not occurred.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Events (CMEs) for Nausea or Retching/Vomiting at Day 2 (24 Hours) as Evaluated by the Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale (SDS)</title>
        <description>CMEs were defined using opioid-related SDS (assessed participant-reported levels of severity concerning 10 symptoms associated with opioid medication usage: fatigue, drowsiness, inability to concentrate, nausea, dizziness, constipation, itching, difficulty with urination, confusion and retching/vomiting). CME = any symptom rated as severe (3) or very severe (4), with the exception of confusion. A total CME score was calculated by summing the number of CMEs across symptoms and ranged from 0 to 9. CME was counted for either nausea or vomiting/retching, or both and reported in this outcome measure.</description>
