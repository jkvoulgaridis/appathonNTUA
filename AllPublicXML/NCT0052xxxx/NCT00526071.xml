      Study to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of migalastat
      hydrochloride (HCl) (migalastat) in participants with Fabry disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a long-term open-label study of migalastat in participants with Fabry disease who
      were previously enrolled in a Phase 2 study of migalastat (FAB-CL-201 [NCT00214500],
      FAB-CL-202 [NCT00283959], FAB-CL-203 [NCT00283933], or FAB-CL-204 [NCT00304512]).
      Participants could enter this extension study immediately upon completion of participation in
      their previous study of migalastat, or at a later time point. Thus, some participants did not
      necessarily have continuous treatment with migalastat from the end of the original study to
      the time of enrollment into this extension study. Participants who enrolled before Protocol
      Amendment 2 received migalastat 150 milligrams (mg) orally once every other day (QOD). After
      the amendment, these participants entered a dose escalation period (DEP) at their next
      scheduled visit. During the DEP, participants received migalastat 250 mg (once daily [QD] for
      3 days and 4 days off per week) for the first 2 months. If there were no safety concerns, the
      dose was then increased to 500 mg QD for 3 days and 4 days off per week). Participants
      received 500 mg (QD for 3 days and 4 days off per week) for up to 10 months, depending on the
      approval date of the protocol amendments at each site. An interim review of safety and PD
      data was performed after all enrolled participants had completed at least 4 months of
      treatment in the DEP. After the review, the dose and regimen of migalastat was returned to
      150 mg QOD for all participants, except those who were on another dose as previously agreed
      by the investigator and medical monitor.

      The sponsor (Amicus Therapeutics) discontinued Study FAB-CL-205 for logistical reasons and
      not due to either safety concerns or lack of efficacy. Participants who were ongoing in Study
      FAB-CL-205 at the time of discontinuation were offered participation in another open-label,
      long-term treatment study of migalastat (AT1001-041 [NCT01458119]). Participants who did not
      enroll in Study AT1001-041 were contacted by telephone or another suitable method
      approximately 1 month after the End of Study (EOS) visit to inquire about adverse events and
      concomitant medications.

    <time_frame>Day 1 (after dosing) through EOS (up to 56 months) or follow-up (28 days after EOS)</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) with start date on or after administration of study drug or pre-existing conditions that worsened on or after the start of the first study drug administration (on Day 1). A severe AE was defined as an AE that was incapacitating and required medical intervention. The number of participants who experienced one or more severe TEAEs after dosing on Day 1 through End of Study (EOS) or follow-up (for participants who did not enroll in Study AT1001-041) are presented. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline In α-Galactosidase A (α-Gal A) Activity In Leukocytes To Month 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 42</time_frame>
    <description>The activity of the α-Gal A enzyme was measured in leukocyte lysate by a validated fluorometric assay method, using 4-methylumbelliferone as a reference. The activity values obtained were normalized to protein (measured using a colorimetric assay). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing pre-treatment value for each participant in his or her respective preceding migalastat Phase 2 study. A negative change from Baseline indicates that α-Gal A activity decreased. α-Gal A activity levels are presented for Baseline and Month 42.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics Of Migalastat As Assessed By Plasma Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>0 (predose on Day 1; start of DEP), 3 hr (postdose at Month 2; during DEP])</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of migalastat was evaluated in plasma following a dose of 250 mg and 500 mg. Blood samples were taken at trough (predose or Time 0; just prior to the third dose during a 3 day on, 4 days off dosing regimen) and at peak (3 hr postdose; after the third dose during a 3 day on, 4 days off dosing regimen) during the Day 1 (250 mg) and Month 2 (500 mg) visits. This outcome presents the lowest and highest concentrations of migalastat measured in any of the participants for predose and 3 hr postdose.</description>

Participants could enter this study directly upon completion of the previous study or at a later point.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study included a dose escalation period (DEP), in which migalastat was administered at 250 milligrams (mg) for 2 months. If there were no safety concerns the dose was increased to 500 mg for up to 10 months, depending on the date of amendment approval. Before and after the DEP, all but 1 participant (post-DEP 300 mg instead) received 150 mg.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The activity of the α-Gal A enzyme was measured in leukocyte lysate by a validated fluorometric assay method, using 4-methylumbelliferone as a reference. The activity values obtained were normalized to protein (measured using a colorimetric assay). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing pre-treatment value for each participant in his or her respective preceding migalastat Phase 2 study. A negative change from Baseline indicates that α-Gal A activity decreased. α-Gal A activity levels are presented for Baseline and Month 42.</description>

        <description>The concentration of migalastat was evaluated in plasma following a dose of 250 mg and 500 mg. Blood samples were taken at trough (predose or Time 0; just prior to the third dose during a 3 day on, 4 days off dosing regimen) and at peak (3 hr postdose; after the third dose during a 3 day on, 4 days off dosing regimen) during the Day 1 (250 mg) and Month 2 (500 mg) visits. This outcome presents the lowest and highest concentrations of migalastat measured in any of the participants for predose and 3 hr postdose.</description>
