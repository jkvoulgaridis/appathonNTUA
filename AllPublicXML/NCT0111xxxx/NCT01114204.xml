    <measure>Participants Who Achieved A ≥2.0 g/dL Increase In Hemoglobin At Any Time From Baseline To Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) through Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who achieved a ≥2.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 are presented. Increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 was calculated for each participant based on:
Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (Week X) - Hemoglobin (Baseline), where Week X was any post-Baseline visit up to and including Week 5.
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to injection of study drug). The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. Participants with no post-Baseline hemoglobin values were classified as not achieving a ≥2.0 g/dL increase.
Statistical analysis was performed for data up to Week 5 only.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change In Hemoglobin From Baseline To Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 was calculated for each participant as: Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (Week 5) - Hemoglobin (Baseline).
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to injection of study drug). The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. If the Week 5 hemoglobin value was missing, the change from Baseline was imputed to be zero.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Achieving A Hemoglobin Level ≥12.0 g/dL At Any Time From Baseline To Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) through Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who achieved a ≥12.0 g/dL hemoglobin level at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 are presented. Increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 was calculated for each participant based on:
Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (Week X) - Hemoglobin (Baseline), where Week X was any post-Baseline visit up to and including Week 5. Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to injection of study drug). The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. Participants without any post-Baseline hemoglobin values were treated as non-responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change In TSAT From Baseline To Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in TSAT from Baseline to Week 5 was calculated for each participant as: TSAT Change = TSAT (Week 5) - TSAT (Baseline).
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to injection of study drug). The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. If the Week 5 TSAT value was missing, the change from Baseline was imputed to be zero.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change In Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score From Baseline To Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a 13 item questionnaire designed and validated to specifically assess the presence and impact of treatment on fatigue and related symptoms, such as tiredness, on health-related quality of life in anemic participants with cancer. The questionnaire has 13 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Scoring ranges from 0 (the most fatigued) to 52 (the least fatigued) points, with higher scores representing better functioning or less fatigue.
Mean change in FACIT-Fatigue Score from Baseline to Week 5 was calculated for each participant as:
FACIT-Fatigue Score Change = FACIT-Fatigue Score (Week 5) - FACIT-Fatigue Score (Baseline).
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to first dose of study drug).The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. If the Week 5 FACIT-Fatigue Score value was missing, the change from Baseline was imputed to be zero.</description>

    <measure>Time To Hemoglobin Increase Of ≥2.0 g/dL Or Hemoglobin Value Of ≥12.0 g/dL From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The time to hemoglobin increase of ≥2.0 g/dL or hemoglobin value of ≥12.0 g/dL was defined as the days from Baseline (Day 1) to the first time the participant had an increase in hemoglobin of ≥2.0 g/dL or hemoglobin value of ≥12.0 g/dL, and was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Participants who did not have a hemoglobin increase of ≥2.0 g/dL or to a hemoglobin level ≥12.0 g/dL were censored at their last visit day. Participants without any post-Baseline study visits were not included.</description>

        <title>Participants Who Achieved A ≥2.0 g/dL Increase In Hemoglobin At Any Time From Baseline To Week 5</title>
        <description>Participants who achieved a ≥2.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 are presented. Increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 was calculated for each participant based on:
Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (Week X) - Hemoglobin (Baseline), where Week X was any post-Baseline visit up to and including Week 5.
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to injection of study drug). The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. Participants with no post-Baseline hemoglobin values were classified as not achieving a ≥2.0 g/dL increase.
Statistical analysis was performed for data up to Week 5 only.</description>

          <description>Participants who achieved a ≥2.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 are presented. Increase in hemoglobin at any time from Baseline up to Week 5 was calculated for each participant based on:
Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (Week X) - Hemoglobin (Baseline), where Week X was any post-Baseline visit up to and including Week 5.
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to injection of study drug). The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. Participants with no post-Baseline hemoglobin values were classified as not achieving a ≥2.0 g/dL increase.

        <title>Mean Change In Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score From Baseline To Week 5</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a 13 item questionnaire designed and validated to specifically assess the presence and impact of treatment on fatigue and related symptoms, such as tiredness, on health-related quality of life in anemic participants with cancer. The questionnaire has 13 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Scoring ranges from 0 (the most fatigued) to 52 (the least fatigued) points, with higher scores representing better functioning or less fatigue.
Mean change in FACIT-Fatigue Score from Baseline to Week 5 was calculated for each participant as:
FACIT-Fatigue Score Change = FACIT-Fatigue Score (Week 5) - FACIT-Fatigue Score (Baseline).
Baseline was defined as the Day 1 value (prior to first dose of study drug).The screening or most recent value prior to Day 1 was used for any participant with missing Day 1 information. If the Week 5 FACIT-Fatigue Score value was missing, the change from Baseline was imputed to be zero.</description>

        <description>The time to hemoglobin increase of ≥2.0 g/dL or hemoglobin value of ≥12.0 g/dL was defined as the days from Baseline (Day 1) to the first time the participant had an increase in hemoglobin of ≥2.0 g/dL or hemoglobin value of ≥12.0 g/dL, and was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Participants who did not have a hemoglobin increase of ≥2.0 g/dL or to a hemoglobin level ≥12.0 g/dL were censored at their last visit day. Participants without any post-Baseline study visits were not included.</description>
