    <measure>Mean Change In Hemoglobin From TP Baseline To TP Week 5 Following The First Course Of Ferumoxytol</measure>
    <time_frame>TP Baseline (Day 1), TP Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in hemoglobin from TP Baseline (Day 1) to TP Week 5 following the first dose of ferumoxytol was calculated as: Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (TP Week 5) - Hemoglobin (TP Baseline) TP Baseline was the most recent value measured on/after the screening or the closest monthly evaluation visit prior to Day 1 dosing of Course 1.
Change from Baseline used an imputed value of 0 for missing values at the post-baseline visit.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change In Hemoglobin Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol From TP Baseline To TP Week 5 Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol After The First Course</measure>
    <time_frame>TP Baseline (Day 1), TP Week 5 for Courses 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in hemoglobin from TP Baseline to TP Week 5 following each course of ferumoxytol after the first course was calculated for each participant as:
Hemoglobin Change = Hemoglobin (TP Week 5) - Hemoglobin (TP Baseline) The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received placebo in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 1. The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received ferumoxytol in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 2; subsequent treatment courses were serially numbered.</description>

    <description>Proportion of participants with an increase in hemoglobin ≥2.0 g/dL at any time from TP Baseline to TP Week 5 following each course of ferumoxytol. The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received placebo in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 1. The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received ferumoxytol in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 2; subsequent treatment courses were serially numbered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Of Participants Who Achieved A Hemoglobin Level ≥12.0 g/dL At Any Time From TP Baseline To TP Week 5 Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol</measure>
    <time_frame>TP Baseline (Day 1), TP Week 5 for Courses 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants who achieved a hemoglobin level ≥12.0 g/dL at any time from TP Baseline to TP Week 5 following each course of ferumoxytol. The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received placebo in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 1. The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received ferumoxytol in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 2; subsequent treatment courses were serially numbered.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change In TSAT Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol From TP Baseline To TP Week 5 Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol</measure>
    <time_frame>TP Baseline (Day 1), TP Week 5 for Courses 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in TSAT from TP Baseline to TP Week 5 following each course of ferumoxytol.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported Outcome Measure: Mean Change In Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Questionnaire From TP Baseline To TP Week 5 Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol</measure>
    <time_frame>TP Baseline (Day 1), TP Week 5 for Courses 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a 13-item questionnaire designed and validated to specifically assess the presence and impact of treatment on fatigue and related symptoms, such as tiredness, on health-related quality of life in anemic participants with cancer. The questionnaire has 13 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Scoring ranges from 0 (the most fatigued) to 52 (the least fatigued) points, with higher scores representing better functioning or less fatigue.
Mean change in FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire from TP Baseline to TP Week 5 following each course of ferumoxytol was calculated as:
FACIT-Fatigue Score Change = FACIT-Fatigue Score (Week 5) - FACIT-Fatigue Score (Baseline).
TP Baseline was the most recent value measured on/after the screening or the closest monthly evaluation visit prior to Day 1 dosing in each course.
If the TP Week 5 FACIT-Fatigue Score value was missing, the change from TP Baseline was conservatively imputed as zero.</description>

    <measure>Time To Hemoglobin Increase Of ≥2.0 g/dL Or To A Hemoglobin Level Of ≥12.0 g/dL From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>TP Baseline (Day 1) up to TP Week 5 for Courses 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Days to event was defined as the days from Baseline to the first time the participant met the criteria. Participants without any post-Baseline study visits were not included in this analysis.
The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received placebo in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 1. The first course of treatment with ferumoxytol for participants who had previously received ferumoxytol in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 2; subsequent treatment courses were serially numbered.</description>

    <description>Participants received ferumoxytol or placebo during AMAG-FER-IDA-301 [NCT01114139]. Participants enrolled in AMAG-FER-IDA-303, a 6-month Extension Study, were evaluated monthly and could receive treatment with ferumoxytol only if they met criteria defined as persistent or recurrent IDA, hemoglobin &lt;11.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;20% at any evaluation visit, (except study termination visit). Participants who met criteria began a 5-week treatment period (TP) and received 2 doses of ferumoxytol 510 mg intravenously (IV). The first IV 510-mg dose was administered on TP Day 1 (Baseline); the second 2-8 (5±3) days after Dose 1. The first treatment course with ferumoxytol for participants who previously received placebo in AMAG-FER-IDA-301 was considered Course 1; Course 2 included participants who previously received ferumoxytol in AMAG-FER-IDA-301; subsequent treatment courses were serially numbered.</description>

        <title>Patient-reported Outcome Measure: Mean Change In Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Questionnaire From TP Baseline To TP Week 5 Following Each Course Of Ferumoxytol</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a 13-item questionnaire designed and validated to specifically assess the presence and impact of treatment on fatigue and related symptoms, such as tiredness, on health-related quality of life in anemic participants with cancer. The questionnaire has 13 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Scoring ranges from 0 (the most fatigued) to 52 (the least fatigued) points, with higher scores representing better functioning or less fatigue.
Mean change in FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire from TP Baseline to TP Week 5 following each course of ferumoxytol was calculated as:
FACIT-Fatigue Score Change = FACIT-Fatigue Score (Week 5) - FACIT-Fatigue Score (Baseline).
TP Baseline was the most recent value measured on/after the screening or the closest monthly evaluation visit prior to Day 1 dosing in each course.
If the TP Week 5 FACIT-Fatigue Score value was missing, the change from TP Baseline was conservatively imputed as zero.</description>

      <desc>The analysis of adverse events focused on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A TEAE was defined as an event with an onset date and time on or after the first dosing start date and time, or on or after the first dosing start date if the onset time was missing. Thus, TEAEs by definition were only assessed in participants who received ferumoxytol in this extension study. Participants who did not receive ferumoxytol were not included the analysis of adverse events.</desc>

          <title>Received Ferumoxytol</title>
          <description>Participants received ferumoxytol during AMAG-FER-IDA-301 [NCT01114139]. Participants enrolled in AMAG-FER-IDA-303 who were found to have persistent or recurrent IDA, defined as hemoglobin &lt;11.0 g/dL and TSAT &lt;20% at any monthly evaluation visit, (with the exception of the Study Termination visit), began a 5-week TP and received a total of 2 doses of ferumoxytol 510 mg IV. The first IV 510 mg dose was administered on TP Day 1 (baseline) and second dose 2 to 8 (5±3) days after Dose 1, for a total cumulative dose of 1.02 g.</description>
