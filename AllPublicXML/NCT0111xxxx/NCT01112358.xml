    <textblock>
      Evaluate the effectiveness of adding lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinizing hormone
      [r-hLH]) in the middle of the follicular phase compared to no addition, in infertile women at
      risk of poor response stimulated with follitropin alfa (recombinant Follicle-Stimulating
      Hormone [r-FSH]) under Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist in vitro
      fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in the number and quality of
      oocytes, follicular development, fertilization oocyte, embryo quality, and pregnancy rate.

    <description>Lutropin alfa (r-hLH) will be administered at a daily dose of 150 International Units (IU) from the presence of at least one follicle greater than (&gt;) 14 millimeter (mm) to complete ovarian stimulation. Follitropin alfa (r-FSH) will be administered at an initial dose of 225-450 IU per day (according to standard center practice); the dose will then be adjusted to ovarian response as assessed by ovarian ultrasound and/or serum estradiol. Participants will also receive analogous GnRH antagonist and natural progesterone, as per standard center practice. To complete follicular maturation and trigger ovulation, a single dose of 250 milligrams (mg) of recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (r-hCG) will be administered subcutaneously at 12 hours after the last injection of lutropin alfa and/or follitropin alfa and analogous GnRH antagonist.</description>

To complete follicular maturation and trigger ovulation, a single dose of 250 milligrams (mg) of recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (r-hCG) was administered subcutaneously at 12 hours after the last injection of lutropin alfa and/or follitropin alfa and analogous GnRH antagonist (on Days 2 to 8).</description>
