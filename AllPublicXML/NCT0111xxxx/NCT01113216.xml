      This research is being done to find the genes and other factors that are responsible for
      differences among persons with cystic fibrosis. We are particularly interested in the factors
      that relate to the development of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD).

      The study is recruiting people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The medical record is being
      extracted, and a blood sample is taken for DNA. The DNA samples are tested for variation both
      at the CFTR gene (the CF gene) and over the entire rest of the genome. Using large numbers of
      people with CF, and knowing who does and does not have CFRD, we identify genetic variations
      that associate with CFRD. Knowing these variations allows us to better understand the causes
      of CFRD, and with enough information, better to predict CFRD and identify people at
      particularly high or low risk of CFRD. People participating in this study also have the
      option to participate in related studies of other metabolic traits in CF such as over- and
      underweight.

      Blood will be drawn from study participants and their parents. Two tablespoons of blood (one
      tablespoon in small children) will be drawn by standard techniques from a vein in the arm.
      Whenever possible, blood samples for this study will be collected at the same time that it is
      done for medically needed blood tests. This blood will be used to extract DNA and to
      establish cell lines that we will store as a permanent source of DNA. We will compare your
      clinical symptoms with your DNA to see if additional genes that affect CF symptoms can be
      found. Some serum and plasma will be stored for later testing, as additional knowledge
      becomes available. Any tests done in the future with your stored blood samples or your DNA
      will only be to answer questions about genes for CF.
