      The primary aims of this study are to: 1) Establish the concurrent criterion-related validity
      of four traumatic brain injury (TBI) screening questions (TBI-4) using the Ohio State
      University TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID) and 2) Establish the concurrent
      criterion-related validity of the TBI-4 with the addition of detailed information elicited by
      the four questions. Secondary aims include: 1) Determining if the addition of detailed
      information elicited by the TBI-4 results in increased specificity; 2) Determining whether
      the prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in this sample is concordant with previous
      research; and 3) Determining whether psychiatric outcomes are worse for veterans with
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) than those with no traumatic brain injury(TBI).

      The primary aims of this study are to: 1) Establish the concurrent criterion-related validity
      of four traumatic brain injury (TBI) screening questions (TBI-4) using the Ohio State
      University TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID) and 2) Establish the concurrent
      criterion-related validity of the TBI-4 with the addition of detailed information elicited by
      the four questions. Secondary aims include: 1) Determining if the addition of detailed
      information elicited by the TBI-4 results in increased specificity; 2) Determining whether
      the prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in this sample is concordant with previous
      research; and 3) Determining whether psychiatric outcomes are worse for veterans with
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) than those with no traumatic brain injury(TBI).

      Primary Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1a: The sensitivity and specificity of the TBI-4 will be significantly greater
      than 0.75 and 0.80, respectively.

      Hypothesis 1b: The sensitivity and specificity of the TBI-4 with the addition of detailed
      information elicited by these questions (i.e., free text information entered by the clinician
      who administered the TBI-4) will be significantly greater than 0.75 and 0.80, respectively.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1c: The specificity of the TBI-4 with the addition of detailed information
      elicited by these questions (i.e., free text information entered by the clinician who
      administered the TBI-4) will be significantly greater than that of the four questions alone.

      Hypothesis 2: A significant difference in psychiatric outcomes (psychiatric hospitalizations,
      suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and completions, and mental health-related contacts) will
      be identified in those with a history of TBI versus those without a history of TBI as
      determined, first, by the TBI-4 and, second, by the OSU TBI-ID.

      Hypothesis 3: The prevalence of Traumatic Brain Injury- Loss of Consciousness (TBI-LOC) in
      this population will be similar to that identified by Walker et al1 (31.7% of individuals
      will report 1 or more TBI-LOC).
