  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to know more about the safety of mobilizing intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients who are receiving vasoactive drugs that support the heart and blood pressure. But
      before this research can be done, several uncertainties need to be addressed.

      To answer these uncertainties, the investigators will ask ICU patients receiving vasoactive
      drugs to take part in a study in three main stages. Firstly ICU patients will be asked
      whether they would be happy to take part in a future research trial on the safety of
      mobilizing patients who are receiving vasoactive drugs. Secondly, data will be collected
      about the current mobilization on vasoactive drugs that occurs. Finally, the investigators
      will try to follow up these patients 60 days after they start the study, to carry out some
      questionnaires and a walking test with the patients. These tests may be used in future
      research to measure the effect of mobilizing patients on vasoactive drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current evidence is insufficient to accurately guide clinicians to know when it is safe
      to start mobilizing intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving vasoactive drugs. Before a
      randomized controlled trial can be designed, several uncertainties need to be addressed. This
      includes clarifying what standard care is, what potential recruitment rates would be and what
      the most suitable primary outcome measure is.

      This study is an exploratory observational study which will aim to recruit up to 40 ICU
      patients receiving vasoactive drugs to further clarify standard care and to measure
      preliminary feasibility outcomes.

      Upon enrolment, patients and clinicians will be surveyed about the hypothetical acceptability
      of recruitment into a future randomized controlled trial. Then any routine mobilization that
      occurs whilst the patient is receiving vasoactive drugs will be analyzed, for example, to
      describe how clinicians assessed safety for mobilization. Finally, patient participants will
      be followed up at day 60 to assess the feasibility of measuring candidate primary outcome
      measures.
