  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improved management of giant congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH) in neonates : decreased
      risk of morbidity and mortality due to prosthesis release. CDH is a rare disease with a still
      very dark prognosis, with a high rate of morbidity and mortality in giants forms linked to
      the release of insufficiently biologically integrated prosthesis. The biological
      functionalization of the prosthetic materials by host PRF would improve the biological
      colonization of materials and thus reduce the risk of prosthetic release.
