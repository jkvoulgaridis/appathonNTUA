  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several techniques such as positive airway pressure and head-up tilt during preoxygenation
      have shown to prolong non-hypoxic apnea period compared to conventional technique. However,
      uniform recommendations have not yet been made. Therefore, in the present study the
      investigators attempted to find out the effect of combination of 5 cmH2O CPAP and 25째 head up
      position during preoxygenation.

      In this study 60 non-obese healthy adult patients were divided into three groups; Group C
      receiving preoxygenation in conventional technique, Group S receiving preoxygenation with 5
      cmH2O CPAP and Group H receiving preoxygenation in 25째 head-up position with 5 cmH2O CPAP.
      After 3 min of preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced and trachea intubated. After confirming
      the tracheal intubation by direct visualization, all patients were left apneic in supine
      position with the tracheal tube exposed to atmosphere till the SpO2 dropped to 92%. The
      primary outcome compared between the groups was the non-hypoxic apnoeic period (time to fall
      SpO2 to 92%).
