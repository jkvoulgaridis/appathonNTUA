  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a single blind randomized control study comparing standard of care for nursing hospital
      discharge education versus same with an additional experimental enhanced educational
      intervention. It is planned that 300 patients will be enrolled in the study. There are two
      initial groups: the enhanced stroke education vs usual stroke education. Patients who meet
      inclusion and not exclusion criteria and provide signed informed consent will be randomized
      to one of the two groups. Assignments will be made based on the order of entry into the
      stroke study database where every other patient entered will be assigned to the treatment
      group. If the patient's caregiver is the primary person responsible for administration of
      medication, determination of meals and activity, the caregiver may be enrolled instead of or
      in addition to the patient. This will be determined by preference of the patient and
      caregiver after discussion of their usual practice. A Neuroscience trained Registered Nurse
      is a nurse who has received specialized education from the organization regarding care of
      patients with stroke and other neurologic illnesses. The Neuroscience trained Registered
      Nurse will provide all patients with basic stroke and risk factor information, educational
      materials and follow-up. The usual care group of patients will receive education provided by
      the Neuroscience trained Registered Nurse who provides care for the patient daily. Education
      will be provided on an ongoing basis throughout the hospital stay with additional focused
      education provided at the time of discharge (within 24 hours of hospital discharge). The
      education will include written and verbal information. Educational content focuses on a
      variety of topics of stroke prevention, detection and management. The enhanced stroke
      education group will receive the same usual care for patient education given by the
      Neuroscience trained Registered Nurse. The enhanced stroke education patient will receive a
      one -time enhanced specific goal-directed educational experience given by a specifically
      trained Stroke Coordinator on the day of discharge. The enhanced education is tailored to the
      unique risk factors of the patient and key concepts for stroke prevention, detection and
      management The patient will be given goals specific to their personal risk factors. Emphasis
      on specific goals for lifestyle change are emphasized. Verbal feedback of key concepts is
      encouraged.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score of Stroke Knowledge Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>2.1.1 We will measure participant retention of in-hospital stroke education using a Stroke Knowledge Questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 17 items. Scores range from 1-17. The questionnaire is based on the American Heart Association Stroke Knowledge Questionnaire. The questionnaire is administered during incident hospitalization for stroke (baseline score) and repeated at the 1 month post discharge appointment. The baseline score is subtracted from the 1 month appointment score and the result reflects improvement or worsening performance. The two groups are compared with respect to this difference between baseline pre-stroke education score (number correct) and 1 month post discharge score. Greater positive difference between pre-test and 1 month test reflect improved performance.</description>
