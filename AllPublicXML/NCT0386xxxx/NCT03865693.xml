  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of chronic pain has been shown to be high after thermal injury. Post-burn
      neuropathic pain causes chronic disabilities that is often difficult to treat effectively.
      Pain Scrambler therapy is a patient-specific electrocutaneous nerve stimulation device. To
      study changes in the pain network associated with neuropathic pain, magnetic resonance
      imaging(MRI) was used to evaluate cerebral blood volume(CBV) in patients who had been
      injuried by burn. Participants (N=40, experimental 20 and control group 20) comprised
      patients with neuropathic pain after thermal injury. The subjects complained of severe
      neuropathic pain that was rated at least 5 on the visual analogue scale (VAS), despite
      treatments with gabapentin medication and other physical modalities. Each Scrambler therapy
      with the MC5-A Calmare® therapy device (Competitive Technologies, Inc. Fairfield, USA ) was
      performed for 40 min daily (Monday through Friday) for 10 consecutive days. The stimulus was
      increased to the maximum intensity bearable by the individual patient without causing any
      additional pain or discomfort. The intensity of neuropathic pain was measured using the
      visual analogue scale(VAS). Depressive mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Scale.
      Voxel-wise comparisons of relative CBV maps were made between before scrambler therapy and
      after 10 scrambler therapy sessions over the entire brain volume. The relationship between
      individual participant CBV(measured in voxels), BDS and VAS score was also examined. We
      observed decreased in the cerebral pain network of patients with burn injury. Scrambler
      therapy is a non-invasive, non-medicinal modality that significantly reduced burn-associated
      neuropathic pain. Scrambler therapy should be considered as a treatment option for burn
      survivors with severe neuropathic pain.

      The groups (scrambler therapy and sham therapy) were randomly assigned. All subjects were
      recruited in scrambler thrapy and sham stimulation. Main study outcomes included group
      differences in CBV changed and the the relationship between CBV changes and neuropathic pain
      intensity. These analyses were performed using the same framework of the general linear
      model, which was repeatedly applied to each voxel with the same coordinates.
