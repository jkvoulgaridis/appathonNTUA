  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of venetoclax when given together with
      azacitidine and pevonedistat and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax and pevonedistat may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      azacitidine, venetoclax, and pevonedistat may work better in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax in combination with
      azacitidine and pevonedistat in patients with previously untreated secondary acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination regimen, as
      defined by the rate of complete response (CR) plus complete response with incomplete bone
      marrow recovery (CRi) within 6 cycles of treatment. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine efficacy outcomes, including CR rate, leukemia response rate (CR + CRi +
      partial response [PR] + morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]), minimal residual disease
      (MRD) negativity by flow cytometry, duration of response, relapse-free survival (RFS),
      event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, azacitidine
      intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7, and pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes on
      days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
