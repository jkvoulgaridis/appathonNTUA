    <masking_description>Patients will be classified based on baseline segmental MyoStrain Fast-SENC strain testing, into lower and higher risk groups. The higher risk group will be randomized with half blinded and half unblinded to intramyocardial strain in terms of assessing cardiotoxicity incidence and management. Physicians will have knowledge of MyoStrain intramyocardial strain and cardiac MRI information in the unblinded group to augment standard of care in detecting and managing cardiotoxicity. Physicians will not have access to or knowledge of intramyocardial strain and cardiac MRI data, except 4 standard cardiac measures, for patients in the blinded group.</masking_description>

This baseline MyoStrain® MRI must demonstrate 2 or more segments measuring &gt;-10% or 9 or more segments &gt;-17% for entrance into the study as the Higher Risk Group
The unblinded treatment arm will enhance patient management by augmenting standard of care with serial MyoStrain® monitoring of the impact of cancer therapy on myocardial function.
Higher Risk unblinded patients will continue to undergo MyoStrain® MRI testing, regardless of study arm, at 1 month (+1 week), 3 months (+ 1 week), 6 months (+1 week), 12 months (+ 30 days), 24 months (+30 days), and 36 months (+30 days) after the baseline visit.
In addition to the MyoStrain® testing, patients will also be asked to complete a brief patient satisfaction questionnaire at each PROACT time point.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant in the SURVIVE registry

          -  Signed informed consent form for PROACT

          -  Histological diagnosis of any cancer type (patients with treated and clinically stable
             brain metastasis are acceptable)

          -  Scheduled to receive anti-cancer therapy (radiation therapy is permitted)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  Unable to comply with study investigations (in the judgment of the investigator)

          -  Life expectancy less than 1 year

          -  Note: If a patient develops a temporary contraindication (e.g. temporary tissue
             expanders in breast cancer patients) after the baseline MRI, follow up MRIs will be
             discontinued for safety for the duration in which the patient has the
             contraindication. However, once the patient is no longer contraindicated to receiving
             MRIs, the study schedule may resume with their next scheduled MRI time point from the
             date of enrollment. Therefore, some time points may be skipped during the patient's
             enrollment in the study.

        Also, if a patient needs a repeat MRI at any time point for any reason (i.e. panic attack
        during the MRI causing them to not be able to continue, unreadable images, etc.), we may
        repeat the MRI as long as the patient is willing.
