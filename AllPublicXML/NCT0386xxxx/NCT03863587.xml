    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts:

      Part I study: to preliminarily compare the PK profile of HLX12 and Cyramza This study is an
      open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled, intravenous single-dose pretrial study comparing
      the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HLX12 and Ramucirumab
      in healthy male adult subjects. The number of subjects is set to 24, who will be randomized
      into two groups, and each group has the same number of subjects (n=12). Group 1 will receive
      intravenous infusion of the test preparation T HLX12, while Group 2 will receive Cyramza,
      once in both groups.

      Part II study: to compare the PK similarity between HLX12 and Cyramza This study is a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, intravenous single-dose Phase I clinical study
      comparing the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of HLX12 and
      Ramucirumab in healthy male adult subjects.The number of subjects is set to 128, and the
      treatment is the same with Part I study.
