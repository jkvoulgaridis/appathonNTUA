  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplantation is the only treatment for end-stage organ dysfunction, with dialysis for the
      kidney. However, donor / recipient (D / R) tissue incompatibility accounts for the majority
      of long-term graft losses, through the development of serum-specific donor antibodies (DSA)
      to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) of donor, with a prevalence of about 10% at 2 years and 20%
      at 5 years.

      DSA immunization is very often directed against one or a few of the donor's incompatible
      antigens, suggesting that epitopes (and antigens) are not all equally immunogenic.
      Identifying HLA epitopes that cause the most and the least immunization would help refine the
      graft distribution to better manage a limited resource by defining the D / R combinations to
      avoid or promote. Since the immunogenicity of an HLA epitope depends on the HLA of the
      recipient given the properties of the epitopes mentioned above, a very large cohort is needed
      to understand this question. To do so, it is necessary to redo these typings with a method
      exploring all the genes (add DQA1, DRB3 / 4/5, DPB1 and DPA1) when this has not been done
      after the graft as part of the standard care. This has become possible since 3 years by DNA
      sequencing called &quot;new generation&quot; (or NGS), a method that is supplanting all others for the
      medical care of patients in transplantation.

      This study is a retrospective cohort study with 5-year follow-up. The investigators' main
      objective is to evaluate the predictive value of the number of mismatched HLA epitopes for
      the development of DSA anti-HLA de novo at 2 years. The investigators' secondary objectives
      are to evaluate this parameter at 5 and 8 years to determine which epitope mismatches should
      be favored / avoided in the future.
