  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer disease is a frequent disease in the late ages that results in global alteration of
      cognitive functions. In which memory complaint can be isolated in the early stages.

      Physiopathology of neuronal degenerescence in Alzheimer disease is complex, two main
      histological lesions are known, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar tangles. Beyond the
      histological knowledge, alterations of neuronal metabolism are described such as oxydative
      phosphorylation and glycolytic pathway. These metabolism alterations are involved in neuronal
      death.

      Multi-nucleus magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive non-irradiant imagery
      technique already used in routine. This technic allows the phosphoenergetic pool assessment,
      that inform about cellular metabolism.

      The aim of the study is to explore the phosphorylated metabolism patterns as predictive
      biomarkers of cognitive decline in patients with a memory complaint diagnosed.
