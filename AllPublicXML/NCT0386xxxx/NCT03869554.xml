  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is genetic X linked disease, with annual incidence of 1 in 100,000 that is
      certainly underestimate the true prevalence of the disease.

      Renal biopsy in some patients does not allow determining the etiology of nephropathy. It is
      why investigators would like to evaluate the screening of Fabry patients from renal biopsy in
      patient with idiopathic nephropathy.

      Investigator hypothesize to detect one or more cases of patients with Fabry disease in local
      idiopathic nephropathy population with renal biopsy.

      That would allow reviewing and optimizing the target screening for Fabry Disease. The purpose
      would be to detect Fabry disease systematically in patients presenting a nephropathy of
      undetermined etiology in spite of the renal biopsy or presenting nonspecific histological
      characteristics.

      In Fabry disease with renal impairment, proteinuria is the first sign, usually occurring in
      the second decade. The evolution is progressively towards end-stage renal failure during the
      fourth decade. The presence of renal impairment is globally associated with a poor prognosis.

      Renal histology can be used to diagnose Fabry disease by revealing sphingolipid deposits
      identified by optical microscopy in the form of vacuoles in podocytes, distal tubule
      epithelial cells or in the media of the distal tubules. vascular walls. Resin inclusion with
      Toluidine blue staining is the staining of choice for visualizing lipid inclusions. However,
      this staining is not used as a first intention in routine. On the paraffin-fixed tissues, the
      vacuoles are less visible because they dissolve.

      Thus, the renal histological analysis sometimes reveals only non-specific damage to the
      various structures of the kidney and may not allow identification of very evocative
      inclusions. Under the effect of oxidative stress induced by sphingolipid deposits, lesions of
      tubulo-interstitial fibrosis settle quite early. At the level of the glomerulus,
      glycosphingolipids lead to the production of angiotensin II and TGF-β leading to an excess
      production of constituents of the glomerular basement membrane inducing its thickening and
      glomerulosclerosis. Arteries of all sizes are also the seat of intimal thickening and media
      accelerating the process of intrarenal ischemia. These lesions, which may appear isolated or
      synchronous, and nonspecific, are sometimes in the foreground and do not point in the first
      line to the etiological diagnosis of Fabry disease.

      Also, among the patients presenting a nephropathy of undetermined etiology in spite of the
      renal biopsy or presenting nonspecific histological characteristics, investigator propose to
      systematically detect the Fabry disease. Screening will be done in a selected population of
      renal biopsy patients using the dried blood spot kits.
