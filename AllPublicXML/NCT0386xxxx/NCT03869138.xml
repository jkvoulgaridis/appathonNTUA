  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological impairment is a devastating disease for patients and their families and a
      leading cause of adult disability. Traditional rehabilitative therapies can help regain motor
      function and ameliorate disability. However, health care reimbursed rehabilitation is usually
      provided for up to 6 months post stroke (3 months in form of inpatient therapy and 3 months
      in outpatient therapy). There are increasing community and other facilities offering
      rehabilitation in form of conventional, recreational and alternative (Yoga, Tai-chi) therapy.
      However, implementation of these conventional therapy techniques in individuals with
      neurological disorder impairments is tedious, resource-intensive, and costly, often requiring
      transportation of patients to specialized facilities. Based on recent evidence suggesting
      significant benefits of repetitive, task-orientated training, investigators propose to
      evaluate the feasibility of an alternative dance and gaming based virtual dance and gaming
      based therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling individuals with
      neurological impairments, compared to conventional therapeutic rehabilitation. This pilot
      study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on compliance and efficacy as well as
      performing power analysis and sample size calculation for developing it into a randomized
      controlled trial for extramural funding purposes. The objective of the study is to determine
      the safety, feasibility, compliance and efficacy of an alternative dance and gaming-based
      virtual gaming therapy to improve overall physical function of community-dwelling individuals
      with neurologically impairment and compare it to that of conventional rehabilitation and also
      to determine the gains in community participation and integration with longer-term compliance
      to the dance and gaming -based intervention.

      This pilot study aims to systematically obtain pilot data on compliance and efficacy as well
      as performing power analysis and sample size calculation for developing it into a randomized
      controlled trial for extramural funding purposes. Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of an
      alternative dance and gaming based cognitive-motor virtual reality therapy to that of a
      conventional rehabilitation in a clinical setting to improve physical and cognitive function
      of healthy adults and neurologically impaired community-dwelling individuals under both short
      duration high intensity and long duration intervention paradigm. The primary safety outcome
      would be the proportion of patients experiencing intervention-related adverse events during
      the study period. The primary feasibility outcome would be the total time receiving
      intervention (i.e. compliance). Motivation index found to correlate highly with compliance
      will be evaluated by the self-report Intrinsic Motivational Inventory and serve as the
      secondary factor. The primary efficacy outcome measures to determine improvements in physical
      function would incorporate main domains: Sensorimotor impairment and function (upper and
      lower extremity), balance control and fall-risk, cognition, cardiovascular function, and
      community participation and integration administered pre and post intervention (details in
      methods). Hypothesis 1: Investigators hypothesize that alternative dance and gaming based
      cognitive-motor virtual reality therapy and perturbation training would show greater efficacy
      through improvement in main domains of physical function (sensorimotor, balance control,
      cognition, fall-risk, and cardiovascular function) compared to the conventional balance
      training. Aim 2: To determine the compliance and gains in community participation and
      integration following gaming based virtual reality intervention. Hypothesis 2: With same
      number of sessions of both types of training, investigators hypothesize that virtual reality
      based interventions would show better compliance to therapy through better score on Intrinsic
      Motivational Inventory (IMI) than the conventional therapy. Higher IMI scores in this virtual
      reality intervention group will be positively correlated with the improvements in quality of
      life (Motor Activity Log), Community integration (CIQ) and Fall-risk reduction (Falls
      Efficacy and Activities-specific balance confidence scales).

      Aim 3: To compare the compliance and effect of a short duration high intensity training (20
      sessions over 6 weeks) with a low intensity longer duration (36 sessions over 12 weeks)
      balance training for the two types of interventions. Hypothesis 3: It is hypothesized that
      for both types of interventions, short duration high intensity training will be as effective
      for improvement in physical function as longer duration low intensity training. However, the
      compliance of short duration training would be greater (higher IMI score) compared to the
      longer duration training.

    <description>Postural Stability can be defined by simultaneous control of center of mass position and velocity during slip-like perturbation relative to the rear edge of base of support (rear heel). The position normalized with the individual's foot length, and velocity by square root of gravitational acceleration and individual's body height. Greater values indicate greater stability.</description>

    <description>Compliance will be assessed by logs of participation time (total time summed over the intervention duration). This will assess if participants were able to complete and tolerate the intervention. Higher values indicate more compliance.</description>

    <description>Reaction time was evaluated with electromyography as the time elapsed between the final cue, &quot;Go&quot; (at 4s), and the onset of EMG signal (calculated as Â±1 standard deviation from baseline). Electromyographic will be used to monitor muscle activity in both upper extremities for stand arm reaching. The test will take about 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>For this purpose, the number of steps taken for up to one week will be measured using a wearable sensor by Tractivity (Huston, Texas). During the initial visit, participant will be given the sensor placed in an ankle band. After initial activity monitoring for one week, participants will be scheduled for the training session. After the training participants post-training one-week physical activity will also be monitored. Higher number of steps, indicate more physical activity.</description>

    <description>Virtual-reality based dance training - Participants received Virtual-reality based dance training for 6 weeks using the commercially available Kinect dance game (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, U.S.A.) &quot;Just Dance 3&quot;. The six week session consisted of 5 sessions/week, next two weeks of 3 sessions/week and last two weeks of 2 sessions/week, for a total of 20 sessions. Participants played on 10 songs for the first 2 weeks, progressing to 12 songs during the 3nd and 4th weeks with an addition of 2 more songs of their choice during the last two weeks. Participants played on alternating slow- and fast-paced songs (each maximum of 4 minutes in duration) with a five minutes break after a set of one slow and fast song.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive therapy using the &quot;Just Dance&quot; using the commercially available Kinect gaming system (Microsoft Inc, Redmond, WA, USA. Each song involves repetitive action for each dance step (at least 20 repetitions over the entire song) and visual cues on the screen (a stick figure at the bottom right) indicating the upcoming dance step. Participant's playing the game to reduce risk of exercise related adverse effects. Participants will dance on 10 songs starting from a slow-pace progressing to a medium pace (each max 5 minutes long). Participants will receive 5 minutes rest after playing on each song. This will be conducted by two physical therapists.</description>

             any injury risk as there is a chance that their bones may be weak. However, they will
             be told that the ultrasound test does give more false positives (i.e. lower scores

        Please note that the exclusion criteria for the Laboratory Slip test will only exclude
        participants from taking this test. They will still be part of the study if other inclusion
        /exclusion criteria are met and will go through the other tests and the intervention
        protocol.
