  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the relationship between genital C. trachomatis and adverse
      pregnancy outcomes, and investigate whether screening and treatment of genital C. trachomatis
      in pregnant women can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.

      Approximately 200 pregnant women from Nanhai Hospital of Southern Medical University in
      Guangzhou, China will be enrolled and randomized to the intervention or control group.

      Women recruited for the study will be randomized to the intervention or control groups. Women
      in the intervention group will be tested in real time for C. trachomatis and Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae. Patients who test positive for either infection will be linked to physicians at
      the Center for treatment. For the control group, women will be tested immediately after
      childbirth or in the event of an adverse pregnancy outcome. In the event of a positive test
      result, a confirmation test will be run and if positive, the patient will be referred for
      treatment. The endpoint of the study is defined as either the occurrence of an adverse
      pregnancy outcome or delivery of a newborn.

      Qualitative in-depth interviews will also be conducted with 20 of the women to explore their
      opinions, attitudes and feedback on the study process. University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill (UNC) investigators will work with the Nanhai Hospital of Southern Medical University
      and staff at Dermatology Hospital of Southern Medical University to oversee the study.

    <description>At the time of recruitment and prior to delivery, this group will have immediate testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Physicians will notify C. trachomatis positive results to pregnant women and suggest them and their spouses to get treated according to the national standard treatment plan for Chlamydia (Azithromycin 1g, single oral administration). Patients will be followed up to confirm cure of C. trachomatis in one month. Partner notification and treatment will be suggested for pregnant women who test positive for Chlamydia.</description>

In the event of a positive test, patients will be informed of the positive test results the same way as the intervention group. Specific treatment options will be the same as the intervention group. Physicians will ask patients to return to Nanhai Hospital one month after treatment for test of cure. Partner notification and treatment will be suggested for pregnant women who test positive for Chlamydia.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. pregnant women on their first visit to the hospital (regardless of gestational age);

          2. aged 18 or above;

          3. agree to participate and sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. systemic or topical vaginal antibiotics use within 2 weeks prior to the first
             perinatal visit;

          2. comorbidities that are known to be related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g.,
             diabetes and hypertension);

          3. diagnosed adverse pregnancy outcomes at recruitment (e.g., stillbirth); Women with a
             previous history of CT or NG and women with a prior adverse outcome will not be
             excluded. Instead, the investigators will conduct sub-analysis and check whether the
             intervention has different effects on different groups of pregnant women.
