      This study investigate if a midwife-led continuity model of care in Palestine, had impact on

      postnatal period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 2013 and 2016 a midwife-led continuity model of care was implemented in parts of the
      Palestinian governmental health system, to improve maternal services to women in rural areas
      on the occupied West Bank. This study investigated if and how the model influenced women`s
      satisfaction with care, through the continuum of the antenatal-, intrapartum- and postnatal
      period.

      Using an observational case-control design to compare the midwife-led continuity model of
      care with regular maternity care. Women with singleton pregnancies, who had registered for
      antenatal care at a rural governmental clinic, were during the first six months after birth
      invited to answer a questionnaire containing 60 questions with a 7-points Likert scale,
      rating different aspects of satisfaction with care.
