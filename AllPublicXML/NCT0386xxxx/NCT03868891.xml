  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevation of the soft palate (the soft part of the roof of the mouth) during swallowing helps
      the Eustachian tube to open and keep the ear healthy. (The Eustachian tube is the normal tube
      running from the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat). When the soft palate does
      not move enough (due to a history of cleft palate or for unknown reasons), this can lead to
      speech problems. Also, because the Eustachian tube is not opening enough, fluid can
      accumulate in the middle ear, which requires treatment with ear tubes. The goal of this
      research study is to determine if soft palate exercises using 1 or 2 devices will help
      improve the ability of the soft palate to close the area between the throat and nose, like it
      is supposed to during speech and swallowing, and if this improves Eustachian tube opening.

      This trial will look at the feasibility and effect of device-assisted soft palate exercises
      for the treatment of chronic Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction (ETD) in older children still
      experiencing middle-ear disease. Children with or without cleft palate (CP) with ventilation
      tubes (VTs) will be evaluated for the function of the soft palate and the ET. Subjects with
      active muscular ETD and inadequate soft palate closure will be prescribed soft palate
      strengthening exercises for at least 2 months. The objective of the study is to demonstrate
      the effect of exercises on soft palate closure and ETF. This pilot study will randomly assign
      48 children between ages 6-17 years with VTs or post-VT extrusion tympanic membrane (TM)
      perforations to the Eustachi only, EMST150 only, or EMST150 + Eustachi group. All 48 children
      will have ETD, with active muscular dysfunction. 24 subjects will have a history of cleft
      palate (CP) and 24 no history of CP. Subjects will undergo history, physical examination
      including an ENT exam, videoendoscopy and ET function testing including Forced Response Test
      (FRT), Inflation-Deflation Test (IDT) and Tubomanometry. They will also undergo evaluations
      for swallow, speech and soft palate function. Enrolled children will then be randomized,
      within CP/non-CP groups and stratified by age (6-11 years, 12-17 years), to the Eustachi
      only, EMST150 only, or EMST150 + Eustachi group and receive instruction on the use of their
      assigned exercise device(s). This device will be used daily for at least 2 months. Subjects
      will undergo full evaluations for ET function and velopharyngeal incompetence after the
      2-month treatment and will then discontinue the use of devices for at least 2 months. After
      this time, the same testing will be done. Weekly phone calls from study staff will encourage
      use of the devices as prescribed.

    <description>The Eustachi has a handle attached to a nose probe that delivers a constant airflow into the nose. The Eustachi is turned on and while one nostril is pinched with one finger, the nose probe is sealed in the other nostril. Your child will swallow 5 times and will complete an exercise diary recording whether a popping or pressure change was felt in the left, right, or both ears. This exercise sequence will be performed twice in each nostril 2 times a day until your child's next visit at the MEPL (at least 8 weeks). Each session should take approximately 10-15 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes per day.</description>

    <description>The EMST150 consists of a handheld plastic tube with a mouthpiece on one end and an adjustable valve on the other end. Your child will close his/her lips around the mouthpiece and breathe out against resistance. The EMST150 will be adjusted to the point where airflow stops. Each day, your child will blow into the EMST150 5 sets of 5 times with a 10-15 second rest between each use and a 1-2 minute rest between each set of 5. You will adjust the resistance of the device each week, take a picture of the device settings, and document exercise sets performed in an exercise diary. These exercises will be performed twice in each nostril 2 times a day until your child's next visit at the MEPL (at least 8 weeks). Each session should take approximately 10-15 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes per day.</description>
