    <measure>Median Time to Onset of Nasal Symptom Relief as Assessed by Participant Diary Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until onset of symptom relief (up to Day 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of relief of nasal stuffiness/congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes, and itching of ears or palate was assessed by the participant using diary response data in the morning and night for the first 3 days of treatment. The participants were asked to rate their relief on the following scale: 1=complete, 2=marked, 3=moderate, 4=slight, and 5=none. If a participant recorded a degree of relief that was at least moderate (3 or below), they answered the question, &quot;When did you first experience noticeable relief?&quot; and noted the date and time. The data were analyzed using a log ranked test and with a Kaplan-Meier estimate. Any participant who did not experience at least moderate relief by the end of 72 hours was considered censored at that time in the analysis. Time to onset of relief is presented in hours.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over 15 Days of Treatment, as Assessed by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (3 days preceding treatment) through Day 15 (averaged over 15 days)</time_frame>
    <description>CFB, averaged over study days 1-15, was calculated for TNSS assessed by participants. Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea; nasal stuffiness; nasal itching; sneezing) in diaries using the scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12 where a higher value indicated greater severity. A decrease in symptom severity is reflected by a negative CFB.
Percent CFB was calculated as the difference between the baseline and 15-day average scores divided by baseline score multiplied by 100. Scores were recorded twice daily, in morning (AM) and night (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to compute the 15-day average score. If diary entries were missing, an average AM or PM score was not calculated. If neither average AM nor PM score was calculated, total 15-day average score was not calculated. Baseline score was an average of the three AM and three PM scores preceding treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at Day 4 as Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>CFB on study Day 4 was calculated for TNSS assessed by investigator. TNSS was a composite of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing scores. The investigator scored each symptom during study visit on study Day 4, on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12 where a higher value indicated greater severity. Percent CFB was calculated as the difference between the baseline and Day 4 scores divided by baseline score multiplied by 100. A negative percent CFB indicated a decrease in symptom severity and a positive percent CFB indicated a worsening of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Median Time to Onset of Nasal Symptom Relief as Assessed by Participant Diary Responses</title>
        <description>Time to onset of relief of nasal stuffiness/congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes, and itching of ears or palate was assessed by the participant using diary response data in the morning and night for the first 3 days of treatment. The participants were asked to rate their relief on the following scale: 1=complete, 2=marked, 3=moderate, 4=slight, and 5=none. If a participant recorded a degree of relief that was at least moderate (3 or below), they answered the question, &quot;When did you first experience noticeable relief?&quot; and noted the date and time. The data were analyzed using a log ranked test and with a Kaplan-Meier estimate. Any participant who did not experience at least moderate relief by the end of 72 hours was considered censored at that time in the analysis. Time to onset of relief is presented in hours.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over 15 Days of Treatment, as Assessed by Participant</title>
        <description>CFB, averaged over study days 1-15, was calculated for TNSS assessed by participants. Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea; nasal stuffiness; nasal itching; sneezing) in diaries using the scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12 where a higher value indicated greater severity. A decrease in symptom severity is reflected by a negative CFB.
Percent CFB was calculated as the difference between the baseline and 15-day average scores divided by baseline score multiplied by 100. Scores were recorded twice daily, in morning (AM) and night (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to compute the 15-day average score. If diary entries were missing, an average AM or PM score was not calculated. If neither average AM nor PM score was calculated, total 15-day average score was not calculated. Baseline score was an average of the three AM and three PM scores preceding treatment.</description>

          <title>Baseline Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) for Calculation of Change From Baseline Averaged Over 15 Days of Treatment as Assessed by Participant</title>
          <description>TNSS was assessed by participants who scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea; nasal stuffiness; nasal itching; sneezing) in diaries using the scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12 where a higher value indicated greater severity. Scores were recorded twice daily, in morning (AM) and night (PM). The baseline score was an average of the three AM and three PM scores preceding treatment.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who took ≥1 dose of study medication and provided ≥1 baseline endpoint observation for the calculation of the CFB in TNSS averaged over 15 days. Baseline data was missing for 1 participant in the mometasone furoate nasal spray group for this endpoint and the participant was excluded from the analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at Day 4 as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>CFB on study Day 4 was calculated for TNSS assessed by investigator. TNSS was a composite of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, nasal itching, and sneezing scores. The investigator scored each symptom during study visit on study Day 4, on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. The composite score ranged from 0-12 where a higher value indicated greater severity. Percent CFB was calculated as the difference between the baseline and Day 4 scores divided by baseline score multiplied by 100. A negative percent CFB indicated a decrease in symptom severity and a positive percent CFB indicated a worsening of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) in Overall Disease Condition Score at Day 8 as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>CFB on study Day 8 was calculated for the overall condition of seasonal allergic rhinitis as assessed by the investigator. The investigator scored the overall condition of the participant during the study visit on study Day 8 on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. A higher value indicated greater severity. Percent CFB was calculated as the difference between the baseline and Day 8 scores divided by baseline score multiplied by 100. A negative percent CFB indicated a decrease in symptom severity and a positive percent CFB indicated a worsening of symptoms.</description>

        <description>CFB on study Day 15 was calculated for the overall condition of seasonal allergic rhinitis as assessed by the participant. The participant scored their overall condition on study Day 15 on the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate; and 3=severe. A higher value indicated greater severity. Percent CFB was calculated as the difference between the baseline and Day 15 scores divided by baseline score multiplied by 100. A negative percent CFB indicated a decrease in symptom severity and a positive percent CFB indicated a worsening of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Therapeutic Response to Treatment at Day 8 as Assessed by Participant</title>
        <description>Mean therapeutic response to treatment was assessed by the participant using diary cards on Day 8. Treatment response was evaluated by the participant using a 5-point scale: 1=complete relief, 2=marked relief, 3=moderate relief, 4=slight relief, and 5=no relief. The scores were averaged across each treatment group with a lower score indicating a greater response to treatment and an improvement in nasal symptoms.</description>
