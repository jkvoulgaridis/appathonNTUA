  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare and include a heterogeneous group of neoplasms derived
      from the endocrine system found in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and lung.
      Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs represent the majority of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN)
      and the annual incidence of all GEP-NETs has been estimated to 6.98 per 100,000 person-years
      in 2012 and is steadily rising. While data on the incidence of metastatic GEP-NET is limited,
      more than 50% of patients with GEP-NET have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.
      Incorrect and delayed diagnoses are still common. Treatment options include surgery,
      locoregional interventions, and systemic treatment.

      The Lyon Real world Evidence in Metastatic NeuroEndocrine Tumours study (LyREMeNET) is a
      descriptive observational cohort study. The main objective is to assess the healthcare
      resources use and the corresponding costs for management of patients with metastatic GEP and
      lung NETs. The secondary objective is to describe the clinical characteristics, prognostic
      factors, treatment patterns, and the overall survival among patients with metastatic GEP and
      lung NETs.

    <description>Patients with metastatic GEP and lung NETs will be selected via the Cancer Database on NEN of the Hospices Civils de Lyon. Data from this database will be matched with the French nationwide claims and hospitalization database (SNDS database), allowing access to the corresponding healthcare resources use and their related costs. Data regarding clinical and tumour characteristics and treatments patterns will be collected via the database between 1 January 1990 and 31 of December 2017.</description>
