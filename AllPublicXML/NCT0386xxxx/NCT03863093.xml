    <textblock>
      Clinical evaluation of using erythritol powder as air polishing with ultrasonic scaling and
      root planing in the treatment of initial periodontal pockets. This trial will be split-mouth
      design, in which each patient will receive traditional treatment (ultrasonic mechanical
      therapy and polishing) in one side, while the contralateral two quadrants of the jaws will be
      treated with erythritol powder by means of air polishing and ultrasonic scaling and root
      planing.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the usage of erythritol powder by means of air polishing
      in hand of undergraduate dental students as a single way to remove biofilm and the adjunctive
      application of ultrasonic piezo afterward for calculus removal and root planing only in the
      treatment of initial periodontal pockets.

      The sample size will be 15 patients. Initially, oral hygiene instructions with scaling and
      root planing will consist of the treatment phase. Each subject will be informed
      comprehensively about oral hygiene instructions using disclosing solution (such as
      erythrosine) and hand mirror. The participant will be shown modified bass technique and the
      proper usage of dental floss and appropriate interdental brushes.

      The control side will be treated with supra- and subgingival ultrasonic piezo scalers then
      supragingival polishing with rubber cup and a special fluoride containing paste as a
      traditional way of removal of plaque and calculus, while the test side, will be confined to
      erythritol powder by means of air polishing as the only way to remove ultrasonic piezo
      scalers.

      At the end of treatment, hand instruments may be used to ensure the smoothness 0f the teeth
      surfaces.

      Clinical measurements will be performed at baseline and at 2 weeks, 4 and 6 weeks for the
      plaque index and gingival indices, whereas probing will be performed only after 6 weeks.

    <measure>change in the papillary bleeding index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 6-weeks after the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Probing is performed in all four quadrants. A quadrant 1 is probed only from the oral aspect, quadrant 2 from the facial, 3 again from oral, and from the facial in quadrant 4
Grade 1—Point: 20-30 seconds after probing the mesial and distal sulci with a periodontal probe, a single bleeding point is observed.
Grade 2—Line/Points: A fine line of blood or several bleeding points become visible at the gingival margin.
Grade 3—Triangle: The interdental triangle becomes more or less filled with blood.
Grade 4—Drops: Profuse bleeding. Immediately after probing, blood flows into the interdental area to cover portions of the tooth and/or gingiva.
Calculation:
Papillary bleeding index= Bleeding Number/ Number of sites measured</description>

    <measure>change in the percentage of study sites positive for bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6-weeks after the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>All four surfaces of all teeth are assessed with regard to whether probing elicits bleeding (+) or not (-). The severity of gingivitis is expressed as a percentage.
- no bleeding upon probing (not recorded)
+ bleeding upon probing
Calculation:
Bleeding on probing= Number of bleeding sites x100 / Number of sites evaluated</description>
