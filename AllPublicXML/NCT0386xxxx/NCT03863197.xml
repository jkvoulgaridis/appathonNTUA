      A randomized controlled trail will be carried out to investigate the effect of a supervised
      12-week home-based progressive strength intervention in children with spastic cerebral palsy
      aged 5-11 years. The results of this strength intervention aiming increase in strength and
      muscle hypertrophy will serve as input for a clinical decision making framework based on
      muscle and tendon architecture.

      Background: The alterations of morphological muscle and tendon properties are a primary
      determinant of the pathological muscle behavior in spastic cerebral palsy (SCP). As
      treatments aim to reduce the progressive secondary problems, they are mainly directed at the
      muscle level. Muscle morphology features like volume, fascicle architecture and tendon
      properties are all responsive to treatment, but these treatment responses seem to be both
      patient and muscle specific. Therefore, objective tools and protocols are needed for the
      evaluation of morphological muscle and tendon (MMT) properties in routine clinical practice.
      These are required to guide patient-specific selection of appropriate, rationalized treatment
      choices and to determine the impact of these treatments on the MMT properties, the muscular
      impairment and function in children with SCP.

      This intervention study is one out of three intervention studies focused on defining the
      effects of conservative treatments (strengthening, stretching and botulinum toxin injections)
      on muscle and tendon architecture. In this phase of the Treatment Algorithms based on Muscle
      and Tendon Morphology (TAMTA) project, we aim to develop specific guidelines for these
      treatment options linked to the MMT evaluation protocol. To achieve this goal, prediction
      models based on baseline MMT parameters for the prognosis of specific treatment outcomes will
      be developed from the data of the three intervention studies.

      Aim: (1) determine whether the 12-week program of targeted progressive strengthening of the
      plantar and dorsiflexors, and the knee flexors and extensors leads to changes in the MMT
      properties of medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, semitendinosus and rectus femoris, in
      the muscle strength and in gross motor function; and (2) determine the correlation between
      baseline MMT properties and the changes in the outcome parameters.

      Methods/Design: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 30 ambulatory children
      with confirmed diagnosis of SCP between 5 and 11 years of age. Participants will be
      randomized to the intervention group (who will additionally receive the strengthening program
      while continuing their usual care) or to the control group (who will continue their usual
      care without additional treatment) using the randomization by minimization method (with
      influencing characteristics age and GMFCS level). The MMT parameters of the medial
      gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, semitendinosus and rectus femoris and the isometric and
      functional strength for the 4 related lower limb muscle groups (plantar flexors,
      dorsiflexors, knee flexors and knee extensors) as well as the gross motor function will be
      assessed before and after the 12-week program. After 6 weeks a short evaluation of the MMT
      parameters, isometric and functional strength will take place.

      The change in primary outcome parameters before and after treatment of the intervention group
      will be compared to the data behavior of the control group. Secondly, to explore the
      predictive value of specific baseline MMT parameters on treatment effect, both univariate and
      multivariate linear regression analyses will be conducted to identify significant predictive
      variables for the primary outcome parameters. Finally, selected parameters of impairment at
      baseline will be used to define the goal of the treatment following the approach of the 'Goal
      Attainment Score' (GAS). The GAS of the intervention group will be predicted by means of
      multiple, multinomial logistic regression using the primary MMT parameters as input for the
      regression model.
