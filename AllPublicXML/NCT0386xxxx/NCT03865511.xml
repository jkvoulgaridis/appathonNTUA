  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that
      is selective for both EGFR-TKI sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations in patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer.

      The AURA 3 study (T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in progression after
      first-line EGFR-TKI therapy, shown that the median duration of progression-free survival was
      significantly longer with osimertinib than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 months
      vs. 4.4 months p&lt;0.001).

      In addition, clinical data show that patients with mutated EGFR NSCLC receiving osimertinib
      in first line, presented an objective response rate of 77 % with a disease control rate of 98
      % and a median PFS was 19.3 months.

      Finally, The FLAURA study randomized phase 3 study clearly demonstrated the superiority of
      osimertinib compared with erlotinib or gefitinib in EGFR mutated nonpretreated NSCLC (median
      PFS of 18.9 months versus 10.2 months).

      However, several issues remain unknown or debated :

        -  What are the mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib prescribed in first-line?

        -  What are the consequences of prolonged exposure to osimertinib on the expression of
           markers of response to immunotherapy?

        -  Is there an association between kinetic parameters of ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) and
           prediction of response to osimertinib and/ or and prediction of therapeutic escape under
           osimertinib? In order to respond to all these questions, this phase II trial will be the
           first to systemically analyze the mechanisms of resistance to Osimertinib based on the
           analysis of biopsy, and collection of plasma from all patients during the course of
           treatment.
