  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to combat excessive perceived norms that contribute to high volume drinking
      by young adults, which adversely affects health and academic achievement. Campus-specific
      survey data will be used to craft accurate, pro-moderation campus norms, and deliver them to
      first-year students via daily text messages during the first semester of college. It is
      predicted that those receiving regular exposure to pro-moderation drinking norms will reduce
      their alcohol consumption and consequences, relative to students who receive
      non-alcohol-related control texts. This preliminary evaluation uses a novel method of
      delivering drinking norms and will lay the groundwork for future efforts to scale up this
      novel alcohol misuse prevention approach.

      Using mobile technology that most students already have in their pockets, this study
      evaluates a novel use of SMS text messages to change campus drinking norms. The aim is to
      correct exaggerated perceptions of drinking norms, and thereby reduce excessive drinking, by
      delivering daily text messages representing accurate, campus-specific, pro-moderation
      descriptive norms (what others do) and injunctive norms (what others approve of). It is
      predicted that with repeated exposure over time, this information will compete with other
      sources of normative information to which students are exposed during their first year of
      college. This exploratory study is designed to develop and refine message content and to
      pilot test the delivery methods.

      First year students (N=120) who are underage but report risky drinking (&gt;4/day or &gt;14/week
      for men; &gt;3/day or &gt;7/week for women) will be randomly assigned to two conditions differing
      by text content: alcohol norms or attention control. All will receive daily text messages
      throughout 10 weeks in the first semester of college. Process measures, 3-month post-test,
      and 3-month follow-up assessments will yield feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      outcome data to inform future larger scale randomized trials. Specifically, baseline,
      post-test, and 3-month follow-up assessments will allow us to test the hypotheses that the
      corrective norms intervention will reduce (a) perceived descriptive and injunctive norms, (b)
      drinking behavior (including high-volume drinking and risky consumption practices), and (c)
      alcohol-related consequences, and increase (d) protective behavioral strategies, relative to
      the control condition.

      At the end of this project the investigative team will have gathered data on both descriptive
      and injunctive norms on a range of drinking behaviors to identify topics in need of
      corrective normative feedback, refined the structure and content of the text messages, and
      pilot tested the text-delivered intervention in a small scale RCT. The proposed research will
      provide evidence of feasibility and efficacy of a text-based alcohol norms intervention for
      reducing excessive drinking among first-year students.

    <time_frame>change from baseline to 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of alcohol-related consequences experienced over the past 30 days is measured by the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (BYAACQ), which is a checklist of 24 items; scores range from 0-24; higher numbers of items endorsed indicate more problems experienced in the past 30 days</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>protective behavioral strategies as assessed by the Strategies Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>self-reported frequency of using strategies to moderate drinking as reported on the Strategy Questionnaire; the Strategy Questionnaire has 3 sub scales including Selective Avoidance (0-70), Strategies While Drinking (0-100), and Alternatives to Drinking (0-40) and higher sub scale scores indicate more frequent use of those strategies</description>

    <measure>perceived descriptive drinking norms as assessed by the Drinking Norms Rating Form</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>perceived descriptive norms are assessed using a variation on the Drinking Norms Rating Form, which asks respondents to estimate the number of standard drinks consumed by other students on campus for each day in a typical week in the past 30 days; daily estimates are summed to yield perceived number of drinks per week for student peers; range of scores can go from zero to no upper limit</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>perceived injunctive drinking norms as assessed by an adaptation of the Drinking Norms Rating Form</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>perceived injunctive norms are assessed using the Krieger et al. (2016) adaptation of the Drinking Norms Rating Form, which asks respondents to estimate the how many standard drinks is deemed acceptable by other students on campus to drink on each day in a typical week in the past 30 days; estimates are summed to yield number of drinks per week approved of by student peers; the scores can range from zero to no upper limit</description>
