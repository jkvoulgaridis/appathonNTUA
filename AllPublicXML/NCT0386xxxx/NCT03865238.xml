      Subjects will receive the first IM injection of study vaccine on Day 1 and will receive a
      second dose 56 days later. A booster vaccine will be given 365 days after the first dose in
      subjects 2 months to &lt; 2 years of age. The last study visit is on Day 422 when subjects will
      be contacted via telephone / home visit system to assess for adverse events and concomitant
      medications.
