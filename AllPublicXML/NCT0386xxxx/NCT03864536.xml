  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this R21 study is to explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
      individualized cognitive prescriptions (CogRxs) in improving engagement in healthy behaviors
      and other outcomes in middle-aged AAs and to gain feedback on future implementation of the
      program.

      A pre-post experimental design will be used, in which 150 AA participants aged 50-65 will
      complete a baseline assessment of cognitive testing and data-driven assessment of
      deficiencies across five CogRx domains (physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep,
      social activity). Participants will be randomized to either: psychoeducation + CogRx,
      psychoeducation only, or no contact control. The psychoeducation and CogRx groups will
      receive general psychoeducation on dementia prevalence, prognosis, and risk factors, while
      the CogRx group will also receive personalized information on their risk factor profile and
      develop a tailored 3-month intervention plan, which will consist of simple evidence-based
      strategies to implement at home. Motivational reminders as well as adherence and
      self-efficacy questions will be administered via text-messaging over the 3-months.
      Participants will return for 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Specific Aim 1 (proximal
      outcomes) is to determine whether the CogRx condition is superior to psychoeducation alone in
      improving engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Specific Aim 2 (distal outcomes) is to
      compare the three conditions on a brief battery of cognitive and psychological measures. The
      Exploratory Aim is to gather feedback for future implementation of this program, including
      cultural considerations, barriers and facilitators to engagement, and likelihood of
      continuing the program.

    <description>Physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep, and social activity are the primary outcome, as the goal of the intervention is to improve behaviors the participant is determined to have deficiencies in at baseline. Since the intervention is tailored, outcomes are unique (e.g., one persons intervention might consist of improving physical activity and diet, whereas another might focus on cognitive activity and sleep). The following self-reported questionnaires will be used: Physical activity (the International Physical Activity Questionnaire), Diet (the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) questionnaire), Social Activity (the Duke Social Support Inventory), Sleep (the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), Cognitive Activity (a modified Florida Cognitive Activities Scale). Cutoffs will be used to create dichotomies for each domain such that 1=optimal and 0=suboptimal, which will be summed to create a Health Behavior composite (scores ranging from 0-5).</description>
