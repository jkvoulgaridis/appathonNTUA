  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulants and antiplatelet treatments are frequently prescribed treatments to prevent or
      treat thromboembolic complications and reduce morbidity and mortality related to
      cardiovascular risk factors. In retina/vitreous surgery, there are rare but potentially
      serious risks of hemmorrhagic complication resulting in irreversible loss of visual acuity.
      There is no clear consensus on how to proceed during the perioperative period with regard to
      the continuation or discontinuation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatments in these
      types of surgery. the purpose of the study is to identify complications at 1 month depending
      on the type of surgery with or without discontinuation of antithrombotic treatments.
      Practitioners are not asked to change their modus operandi. The hypothesis is that there is
      no excess risk of peri- or post-operative hemorrhage in retino-vitreous surgery in patients
      treated with antithrombotic compared to untreated patients and that therefore discontinuation
      of these treatments before surgery is not necessary.
