      xCELLigence system for the selection of an effective antibiotic treatment for each patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis in a chronic disease caused by bacteria present in the subgingival flora, which
      induces an inflammatory response of periodontal tissues. It has been suggested that some
      periodontal pathogens may be inaccessible to mechanical periodontal therapy due to its
      ability to invade the gingival tissues and evade defense mechanisms of the host. Therefore,
      it is conceivable that coadjuvant administration of antimicrobials may improve the outcome of
      mechanical therapy. There are several techniques to monitor periodontal pathogens and
      determine antibiotic therapy. But the most important disadvantage of conventional laboratory
      methods is that they are indirect, based on the molecular detection of 3 to 10 bacterial
      species, without analyzing whether the biofilm as a whole is sensitive or resistant to
      treatment, being a possible cause of failure and / or recurrence of the disease, in addition
      to the risk of development of antimicrobial resistance.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the specific selection of antimicrobial treatment with
      the xCELLigence system allows better improvements in clinical parameters than indirect
      laboratory methods.

      Materials and methods:

      A randomized double-blind clinical trial will be launched. Samples of subgingival plaque will
      be taken with paper tips. Subjects included in the study will be randomized to one of 3
      treatment groups: scaling and root planing combined with systemically administration of
      antibiotic suggested by the xCELLigence system; scaling and root planing combined with
      systemically administration of antibiotic suggested by 'Echevarne' laboratory and scaling and
      root planing combined with systemically administration of antibiotic suggested by 'Origen'
      laboratory.

    <description>The probing depth will be measured in six areas (disto-buccal, mediate-vestibular, mesio-buccal, disto-palatal, mid-palatal, and mesio-palatal) of each tooth with Williams PQ-OW 208 396 probe. It will be use with a pressure of 20 grams that is equivalent to the pressure of dropping the weight of the probe without exerting additional pressure.</description>

    <description>Following the baseline examination each of the 20 randomly selected patients will be informed about the cause of periodontal disease.
The 10 deepest interproximal sites in each quadrant will be selected and exposed to microbial sampling. Two sterilized paper points will be inserted into the pocket of each site and will be keep in place for 60 s. The twin paper points will be remove and distributed in two vials and transfer for microbiological processing.
The study participants will undergo SCALE AND ROOT PLANING (SRP). SRP will be performed two quadrants at a time under local anaesthesia at approximately weekly intervals.
The adjunctive antibiotics selected by 'the exCELLingence' system will be started at the second SRP visit.</description>
