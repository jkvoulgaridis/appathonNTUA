  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators wishes to influence the gut microbiota in patients with alcoholic liver disease
      in a randomized controlled clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that the
      alcohol-related dysbiosis seen in these patients can be changed and disease progression
      haltered by modulating microbiota with probiotics during 24 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic alcohol overuse is associated with increased gut permeability and in addition, the
      intestinal microbiota changes qualitatively (dysbiosis) and quantitatively (bacterial
      overgrowth) in alcoholic liver disease in favour of a microbiota with increased invasive
      potential. As a consequence, an increased load of bacterial products is transported to the
      liver leading to inflammation and fibrogenesis.

      This cross talk between the intestinal microbiota and the liver constitute a gut-liver axis,
      which is increasingly recognized as key mechanism in the progression of liver disease and
      pathogenesis of liver related complications.

      The investigators hypothesize that the gut microbiota and its metabolites are major drivers
      of fibrosis in human liver disease and that modulating the intestinal flora by Profermin® (a
      food for special medical purposes) will modulate the alcohol related dysbiotic signatures in
      the microbiota which may halter disease progression by reducing activity of hepatic stellate
      cells.

      Dietary supplements that alter the microbiome towards a more beneficent type may improve
      liver inflammation and thus be a better alternative than supplements that simply add
      nutrients. Investigators expect that the trial will provide proof-of-concept for a
      sustainable dietary strategy in liver fibrosis.

    <description>Fresubin® is a standard FSMP and will be used as control product. Since Profermin Plus® is a disease-specific FSMP, the documentation must prove an effect that cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone or by standard FSMP's. Therefor the comparator must be a standard FSMP, i.e. a nutritionally complete FSMP with standard nutrient formulation, which may constitute the sole source of nourishment of a person, hence the reason for using Fresubin® as comparator.</description>
