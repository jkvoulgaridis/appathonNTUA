  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study assessing fMRI changes and neurocognitive function in women with
      pre-eclampsia and healthy controls. Neurocognitive testing will be done during pregnancy and
      after delivery up to 2-6 weeks postpartum. fMRI will be done after delivery up to 2-6 weeks
      postpartum. The aims of this pilot study are therefore to 1) Determine the frequency and
      nature of co-morbid DTI white matter patency and fMRI functional connectivity changes in
      women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and 2) Determine the relationship between DTI white matter
      patency and fMRI functional connectivity changes to measurable alterations in cognitive
      function in this patient population. The aims of this pilot study are therefore to 1)
      Determine the frequency and nature of co-morbid DTI white matter patency and fMRI functional
      connectivity changes in women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and 2) Determine the relationship
      between DTI white matter patency and fMRI functional connectivity changes to measurable
      alterations in cognitive function in this patient population.

    <description>Subjects will complete neuroimaging procedures at 2-6-week postpartum or during hospitalization after delivery prior to discharge, which will consist of high-resolution anatomic, perfusion and resting-brain fMRI sequences; all of which will be acquired on a 3-Tesla General Electric magnetic resonance scanner
provided by the Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC) at Duke University. No contrast agent will be administered in these imaging procedures.</description>

        Parturients with severe pre-eclampsia on the labor and delivery ward and healthy controls
        presenting to the antenatal clinic or the labor ward will be screened. 15 English-speaking
        pregnant controls with uncomplicated pregnancy matched by age and gestational age will be
        enrolled from the antenatal clinic or the labor ward.

        Inclusion Criteria:Severe Pre-Eclampsia defined by

          -  Symptoms of central nervous system dysfunction (New onset cerebral or visual
             disturbance, such as: Photopsia, scotomata, cortical blindness, retinal vasospasm)
