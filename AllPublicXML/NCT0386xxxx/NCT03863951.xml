      The investigators aim to explore the relationship between gut microbiota composition and
      earlier poststroke depression via 16S rRNA sequencing.

      In this study, patients with first ever acute ischemic stroke were studied. According to the
      psychological assessment, patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not
      there was a PSD at the earlier stage of stroke. Clinical biological data and blood and feces
      samples were collected. Firstly, 16srDNA sequencing was used to study the difference in the
      composition and diversity of intestinal microbial communities in the two groups of patients.
      Then the two groups selected individual representative samples and conducted macro genome
      sequencing. At the same time, by analyzing the correlation between the intestinal flora and
      the clinical risk factors and neurotransmitters in early PSD patients, the key functional
      bacteria related to PSD were identified.
