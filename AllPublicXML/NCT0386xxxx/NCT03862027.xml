  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to demonstrate that use of transpulmonary pressure to guide PEEP management is safe in
      patients with possible elevations of intracranial pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To establish safety of titrating PEEP based on transpulmonary pressure as measured
      by an esophageal balloon in mechanically ventilated neurosurgical patients.

      Participants: Adult patients admitted to the Neuro ICU at UNC Hospital and requiring
      mechanical ventilation who have an intracranial pressure monitoring device in place.

      Procedures (methods): All enrolled patients will have esophageal balloons placed with
      measurement of transpulmonary pressures. All patients will have baseline measurements
      recorded of intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and cerebral autoregulation.
      PEEP will then be titrated based on transpulmonary pressure measurements with recording of
      physiological measurements over the next hour. At the conclusion of the hour, all patients
      will be returned to their prior ventilator settings.

    <description>All patients will have an esophageal balloon catheter inserted into their nare while upright (head of bed &gt; 30 degrees) to a depth slightly more than the estimated distance from the lower sternum to the back of the ear (typically around 60 cm). Gastric positioning will be confirmed with abdominal compression testing and the catheter then retracted 10 - 20 cm into the lower esophagus. Placement will be confirmed with the presence of cardiac oscillations on the esophageal probe. The probe will then be secured to the patient's nasal opening using tape.</description>

    <description>Pressures [Esophageal Pressure (Pes), Airway Pressure (Paw), and Transpulmonary Pressure (Ptp)] are measured directly through the ventilator. The waveforms of Paw, Pes, and Ptp will be visualized on the ventilator. Ptp is obtained from Paw - Pes. All patients will have baseline measurements recorded of ICP, CPP, and MAP.
PEEP will be increased on the ventilator to achieve a Ptp between 0 and +2 cm H2O (&quot;Optimal PEEP&quot;).
Measurements of Intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be repeated 5 minutes after the change in PEEP.</description>
