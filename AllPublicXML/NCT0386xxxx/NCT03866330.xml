      This phase I/II study will enroll 100 subjects with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the
      hip/knee/ glenohumeral joint will be enrolled according to strict inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. All patients are selected and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups based
      on clinical presentation. Subjects will receive a single dose of at least 10 million of
      Wharton Jelly derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (WJMSC) prepared by the Polish Stem Cell Bank
      every three months for 12 months (maximum four doses in total and at least 40 million of
      WJMSC in total) via ultrasound guided intra-articular injection. During the study period and
      24 months after last injection they will be followed by clinical assessment, laboratory
      investigations including inflammatory markers and microRNA, as well as magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the injected joint. The investigators will also determine the local and
      systemic safety of the procedure and therapy with WJMSC.

    <description>Change in HOOS score. HOOS consists of 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living (ADL), and function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec), and hip-related quality of life (QOL). In total, 40 items: 10 items for pain, 5 items for other symptoms (3 for symptoms and 2 for stiff- ness), 17 items for function in ADL, 4 items for function in Sport/Rec, and 4 items for hip-related QOL. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is scored from 0 to 4. Scores are summarized for each subscale and trans- formed to a 0-100 scale (0 indicating extreme problems and 100 indicating no problems).</description>

    <description>Change in Harris Hip Score (HHS) The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).</description>

    <description>Change in KOOS score
It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)
The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures.</description>

    <description>Change in modified Harris Hip Score (HHS) The domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The pain domain measures pain severity and its effect on activities and need for pain medication. The function domain consists of daily activities (stair use, using public transportation, sitting, and managing shoes and socks) and gait (limp, support needed, and walking distance). Deformity takes into account hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, and extremity length discrepancy. Range of motion measures hip flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation, and adduction. There are 10 items. The score has a maximum of 100 points (best possible outcome) covering pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).</description>

    <measure>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)]</time_frame>
    <description>Change in IKDC Questionnaire score
The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee.
Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function
The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2), 9 months (T3), 12 months (T4), 24 months (T5)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in DASH score
The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome measure is a 30-item. The items enquire about the degree of difficulty in performing different physical activities because of arm, shoulder and hand problems (21 items), the severity of each of the symptoms of pain, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness and stiffness (five items) and the impact of the problem on social functioning, work, sleep and self-image (four items).
The scores are then used to calculate a scale score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability
A minimum score is 30; a maximum is 150. The range of the scores, therefore—from 30 to 150—equals 120. The raw score is then transformed to a zero-to-100 scale with zero reflecting no disability (good function) and 100 reflecting maximum disability.</description>

    <description>Change in CMS. The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient
The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function</description>

    <description>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain in the target hip following completion of treatment cycles. Visual analogue scales (VAS) are psychometric measuring instruments designed to document the characteristics of disease-related symptom severity in individual patients and use this to achieve a rapid (statistically measurable and reproducible) classification of symptom severity and disease control The VAS is a commonly used tool in health outcome studies, when using it to assess importance of certain action or intervention, how we can interpret the results, on 1 to 10 line (where 1; the least and the 10; the highest),</description>
