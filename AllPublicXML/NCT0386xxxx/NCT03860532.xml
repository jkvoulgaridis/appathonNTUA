      Eligible subjects will randomly recieve 1200 mg tablets (600 mg tablet X 2) or 1200 mg
      capsules (200 mg capsule X 6) of HMPL-011 under fed and fed circumstance in part 1. In part
      2, eight subjects will be enrolled and given 800 mg tablets (400 mg/tablet X 2) every 8 hours
      daily for 6 days (morning dose only on Day 6).
