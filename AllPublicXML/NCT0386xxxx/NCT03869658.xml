  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will pilot test a new app for self-monitoring food intake using natural spoken
      language (by voice recognition or text) to provide daily estimates of energy and nutrient
      intakes with a phone app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-recording food intake is recommended for weight management and healthy eating. However,
      current methods, including web platforms and apps, are often burdensome leading to short-term
      use by the consumer. The solution uses cutting-edge speech and language understanding
      technology to streamline the food logging process. With this technology, the user simply
      describes what they ate and the system automatically selects the appropriate items and
      quantities consumed from the USDA food database, which calculates the nutrition profile of
      the entry.

    <time_frame>Between days 3 and 7 of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be to assess whether food capture using the mobile application is comparable with conventional 24-hour dietary recall. This will be done by measuring the energy intake (mean of two days) in the two methods.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete a screening survey to determine their eligibility for the study, if eligible and willing to participate, he or she will sign an informed consent form. Once participants are enrolled in the study, a demographics questionnaire will be completed along with 5 days of food tracking on the COCO application. Between days 3 and 7, participants will complete two 24-hr diet recall, one a day, and a patient satisfaction questionnaire.</description>
