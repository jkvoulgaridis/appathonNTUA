  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia (nearsightedness) is the most common developmental eye disorder in the first decades
      of life. It is the biggest risk factor for sight threatening degenerative eye diseases later
      in life, second only to age. Its prevalence is increasing worldwide in pandemic dimensions
      affecting now &gt; 80% in Asian and &gt; 40% in Caucasian populations. Myopia is one of the five
      eye diseases identified as immediate priorities by the WHO's global initiative for the
      elimination of avoidable blindness. It usually develops during primary school and its onset
      and progression are related to environmental factors such as near work and lack of day light
      exposure, to a lesser degree to genetic factors. Therefore, retardation of myopia progression
      is a major therapeutic goal. Clinical trials from Asia have shown that 0.01% atropine eye
      drops can attenuate progression of myopia while inducing only little side effects such as
      light sensitivity and reduced accommodation. However, it is unclear whether this therapy is
      equally and sufficiently efficacious in a Caucasian population. Due to the increasing
      prevalence also in Europe and an increasing demand from parents for means to retard myopia
      progression, the trial is the first European large scale randomized clinical trial
      investigating the safety and efficacy of 0.01% atropine eye drops in comparison to placebo
      drops. Such a trial is mandatory to substantiate the increasing off-label prescriptions of
      low-dose atropine in children and to develop clinical guidelines.
