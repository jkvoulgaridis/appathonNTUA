  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving haplo-SCT are at high-risk of relapse. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells exhibit is a
      well-known population able to exert cytotoxicity toward a large range of tumor in vitro or in
      vivo. Activating and expanding Vγ9Vδ2 T cells early after haplo-SCT by using a combination of
      Zoledronic acid and low-dose interleukine (IL) -2 may be of benefit for patients by reducing
      incidence of relapse. The optimal dose of IL-2 to use remains to be determined.

      This will be a Phase 1 3+3 escalation study. Three to 15 patients are planned. It will be
      proposed to Patients who refuse to participate to have samples collected until day +70 to
      study immune and gamma/delta T cells reconstitutions after haplo-transplant.

      Zoledronic acid will be administered as a single dose according to marketing and regulatory
      authorization at the dose of 4 mg over 15 min intravenously at day+15 post-transplant.
      Zoledronic acid infusion must be stopped in case of grade 3/4 adverse events during infusion.

      IL-2 will be administered at a unique low-dose level 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks
      from Monday to Friday subcutaneously . IL-2 has already marketing authorization for various
      indications.

      Three IL2 levels will be tested:

      Level 1: 2 millions UI/Infusion Level 2: 4 millions UI/Infusion Level 3: 6 millions
      UI/Infusion Zoledronic acid and IL2 have to start at day+15 if it is a Monday or the first
      Monday following day+15 in order to avoid administration on week-end.
