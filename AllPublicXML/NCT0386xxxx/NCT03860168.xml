  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent decreases in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) mortality rates have been offset by
      increased morbidity and length of stay for vulnerable young patients. Heavy sedation,
      bedrest, and delirium contribute to a PICU culture of immobility. While studies in adult ICU
      patients demonstrate the clinical benefits of early mobilization, fewer than 25% of
      critically ill children mobilize early in the children's PICU stay. The investigators have
      demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the 'PICU Up!' Mobility Program, which integrates
      sleep promotion, delirium prevention, sedation optimization as a bundle to increase
      mobilization. However, the generalizability and broader impact on patient- and
      family-centered outcomes is unknown. Therefore, there is an urgent need for trials that blend
      both clinical effectiveness and implementation research to create a PICU culture of mobility
      and improve the value of PICU care. The overall objective of the proposed research is to
      determine the impact of a transdisciplinary and multifaceted early mobility program on
      clinical outcomes and ICU-acquired morbidities in critically ill children. Additionally, the
      investigators will identify barriers and facilitators to high-performance bundle adoption.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted using a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (RCT) design, with each PICU acting as one cluster. In a traditional stepped-wedge (TSW) design, all clusters begin in the control group and then transition to the intervention group at sequential and randomly assigned periods, facilitating the delivery of a desired intervention to all clusters, in this case, all participating PICUs.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The PICU Up! intervention is a multifaceted mobility program incorporating the ABCDEF bundle components into routine PICU care through multidisciplinary staff education and a structured pathway to determine a patient's daily mobility goal. PICU Up! was developed by a collaborative multidisciplinary team approach, and the central components include the consultation and involvement of physical therapy/occupational therapy (PT/OT) by PICU Day 3, sleep hygiene promotion and routine delirium screening for all PICU patients utilizing a validated tool.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for Participating Units:

          -  Participating PICUs must be a separate physical space dedicated to the care of
             critically ill infants and children, with the ability to provide mechanical
             ventilation.

          -  Not implemented a PICU mobility protocol and would commit to not implementing a
             mobility protocol until the randomized time of unit implementation.

        Inclusion Criteria for Patients:

        All patients admitted to the PICUs regardless of length of stay will receive the unit-based
        PICU Up! intervention, which includes criteria for no mobilization based on specific
        clinical factors (i.e. open chest, surgeon request).10 For inclusion in data analysis,
        patients will be eligible if

          -  Admitted to the participating PICU â‰¥ 3 days.

        Exclusion Criteria for Patients:

          -  Patients with an active do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order will be excluded.
