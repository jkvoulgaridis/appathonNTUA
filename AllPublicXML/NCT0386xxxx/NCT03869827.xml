  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common gastroenterological emergency in neonatology.
      Its mortality is high, ranging from 15 to 30%. Prematurity is the main risk factor for
      necrotizing enterocolitis, as well as the very low birth weight (&lt;1500 g) associated with
      prematurity. Among the early neonatal complications of intrauterine growth restriction
      neonates, necrotizing enterocolitis is frequently reported in the literature. The situation
      of chronic hypoxia of these fetuses is at the origin of a vascular redistribution favoring
      the cerebral circulation to the detriment of the mesenteric vascularization, which could lead
      to the development of an necrotizing enterocolitis. However, data from the literature
      concerning this over-risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in the case of intrauterine growth
      restriction are discordant. The heterogeneity of the definitions used for the intrauterine
      growth restriction and diagnostic criteria for necrotizing enterocolitis from one study to
      another could explain these discrepancies. The investigator's hypothesis is that the risk of
      necrotizing enterocolitis is higher among newborns in intrauterine growth restriction
      compared to control children.
