  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The non-invasive measurement of dysfunctional hemoglobins allows physicians to monitor levels
      in affected individuals without requiring blood samples or laboratory testing. Nonin Medical
      Inc, has recently developed a multi-wavelength device that measures carboxyhemoglobin and
      methemoglobin non-invasively. The primary objective of this study is to validate %MetHb and
      SpO2 accuracy performance of the study device. Evaluations will be for the range of 0 to 15%
      MetHb with 95-100% SaO2 as assessed by CO-oximetry, and 0-15% MetHb accuracy under conditions
      of elevated HHb (SaO2 80-100%) as assessed by CO-oximetry, and SpO2 with 80-100% SaO2 during
      elevated MetHb as assessed by CO-oximetry.

      The goal of this study is to collect data with induced hypoxia, with induced
      methemoglobinemia, and with induced hypoxia and methemoglobinemia. This will be accomplished
      in three runs with 24 to 28 plateaus total. The number of plateaus will be dependent on the
      subject's tolerance of the study procedure. The first run will be strictly induction of
      hypoxia down to approximately 70% saturation. The second run will be induction of hypoxia
      down to approximately 80% saturation with mild hypoxia at 7% MetHb. The third run will be
      induction of hypoxia down to approximately 80% saturation with a target MetHb of 11-15%.
