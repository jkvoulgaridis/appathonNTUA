  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hands are the most frequent injury sites caused by burn, and appropriate rehabilitation is
      essential to ensure that good functional recovery is achieved. Many interventions have been
      developed for patients with burns; however, hand rehabilitation tools are limited. Virtual
      reality (VR)-based rehabilitation has proven beneficial to the functions of upper and lower
      extremities. To investigate VR-based rehabilitation effects on burned hands, we compare the
      results of VR rehabilitation group to the results of matched conventional(CON) rehabilitation
      group.This single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial involved 31 patients with burns and
      dominant right-hand function impairment. Patients were randomized into a VR or a CON group.
      Each intervention was applied to the affected hand for 4 weeks. Hand function was evaluated
      using the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), grasp and pinch power test, and Michigan
      Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ). These assessments were evaluated pre-intervention and 4
      weeks post-intervention.Our study results suggest that VR-based rehabilitation is likely to
      be as effective as conventional rehabilitation for recovering hand function in a burned hand.
      VR-based rehabilitation may be considered a treatment option for burned hands.

      Appropriate rehabilitation is important to ensure that good functional recovery is achieved.
      Burned hands are usually treated and managed by a multidisciplinary team at a burn center to
      conservatively manage hypertrophic scars. Rehabilitation of the burned hand should be
      initiated in the acute stages to set individualized positioning, splinting and exercise for
      functional activity. Frequent exercises throughout the day are more beneficial than one
      intensive exercise. Repeated range of motion (ROM) exercises are helpful in decreasing edema
      and conditioning the tissue. Despite adequate rehabilitation of the burned hand, hand
      functional disorders may occur. Many interventions have been developed and trialed for
      patients with burns; however, hand rehabilitation tools are limited and remain controversial.

      Recent studies have recommended that for the functional recovery of upper extremity disorder,
      repetitive exercises using VR have been useful. Task-specific training has been shown to be
      more effective when tasks were ordered in a random practice sequence using repetition and
      positive feedback. VR is an interactive and enjoyable intervention. VR creates a virtual
      rehabilitation scene in which the intensity of practice can be systemically manipulated. This
      study aimed to evaluate the effects of VR-based rehabilitation on burned hands, and compare
      the results to those of matched CON rehabilitation in patients with burns.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients' burn scars had re-epithelialized after aseptic care or skin graft. We
             included patients aged ≥18 years with a deep partial-thickness (second-degree) burn or
             a full thickness (third-degree) burn to their hands, with joint contracture(hand and
             wrist), having been transferred to the rehabilitation department after acute burn
             treatment, and less than 6 months since the onset of the burn injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who had fourth-degree burns(involving muscles, tendons, and bone injuries),
             musculoskeletal diseases(fracture, amputation, rheumatoid arthritis, and degenerative
             joint diseases) in the burned hand, or neurological diseases(such as peripheral nerve
             disorders), preexisting physical and psychologic disability (severe aphasia and
             cognitive impairment that could influence the intervention), and severe pain impeding
             hand rehabilitation.
