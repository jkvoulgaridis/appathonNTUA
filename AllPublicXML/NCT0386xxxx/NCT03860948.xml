  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open lebal, single-dose, three-period, crossover
      clinical study in healthy Chinese male subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics and
      bioequivalence/bioavailability of two formulation savolitinib tablets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty six Chinese male subjects who met the inclusion criteria but not met the exclusion
      criteria, will be hospitalized in Phase I Ward one day before first dosing and randomized
      into three groups, 12 subjects each, at a ratio of 1:1:1. The subjects in the different group
      will follow the fixed dosing regimen with 600 mg savolitinib tablets (200 mg/tablet x 3
      tablets) after the standard meal on day 1 in cycle 1, 2 and 3 respectively: TRR, RTR or RRT,
      where &quot;T&quot; indicates dry granulation savolitinib tablet and &quot;R&quot; indicates wet granulation
      savolitinib tablet. PK blood samples, 2 mL each time, will be collected at the following time
      points in each dosing cycle: within 0.5 hours before dosing and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,
      5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 hours after dosing(16 time-points).
