  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the audiological and quality of life performance patients
      have with an ADHEAR (adhesive bone conduction device) compared to no hearing device.

      Patients will be recruited at the outpatient's department of the Medical University of Vienna
      - Otorhinolaryngology department. Patient will be asked to participate in the study when
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. Mostly patients scheduled for a surgery improving
      conductive hearing loss or scheduled for implantation of an implantable bone conduction
      hearing aid will be included in the study.

      Patients who do not use a hearing aid and who are not planning on using a hearing aid meeting
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be asked to participate in the study. After
      inclusion in the study patients will be asked to fill out two questionnaires (quality of life
      and hearing specific questionnaire). They will then be fitted with an ADHEAR device and
      undergo unaided and aided soundfield audiometry. Randomization will be carried out
      (Randomization ratio 1.4:1) and patients in the intervention group will keep the device for
      the following 4 months with one visit after the first probation time of one month. At the one
      month mark patients in the control group will be asked to fill out the two questionnaires.
      Patients in the control group will be asked to return to the department and fill out the
      three questionnaires (SSQ-12 (Speech Spatial and Hearing Questionnaire), AQoL(Assessment of
      Quality of Life) and In-house questionnaire). Further audiologic assessment will be carried
      out. At this appointment patients will be able to talk about their experiences in the
      probation period und easily terminate the study in case of insufficient improvement, pain,
      skin irritations or other issues. At the four month mark patients in both groups will be
      asked to return for audiologic assessment and for filling out the questionnaires.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate, whether patients using ADHEAR have a significantly improved quality of life compared to patients not fitted with a device with the AQoL (Assessment of Quality of Life) questionnaire. It comprises 35 questions covering a multitude of quality of life aspects. Weighted utilities are generated using the algorithms provided on the AQoL website. Weighted utilities give a number between 0 and 1 as answer for every question. These sub scores are then presented.</description>
