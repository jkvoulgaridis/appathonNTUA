  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speech understanding in noise remains the greatest challenge for people using cochlear
      implants, particularly when the speech of interest comes from the side of the head opposite
      to the implant. Recent findings in hearing technology allow for people to either use a
      hearing aid or a Contralateral Routing of Signal (CROS) device on the non-implanted ear.
      Differences in speech understanding may result depending on the device chosen by a person,
      and these differences may be measureable through speech discrimination measurement methods.

      This study intends to determine whether or not a CROS device improves speech perception in
      noise when the source of the speech of interest originates from the side of the head opposite
      to the implant.

    <measure>Questionnaire: Acceptability ratings. Cochlear Implant with Hearing Aid in non-implanted ear, Speech Contralateral, Noise Omni</measure>
    <time_frame>12 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Following each IEEE noise test, the subject will rate how acceptable it would be for the subject to listen in the conditions of the test using his/her cochlear implant and hearing aid in the non-implanted ear on an everyday basis. Outcome #36 will assess speech coming from the opposite side of the implant (Contralateral) with competing noise coming from all directions (Omni). The rating scale is 0-100, 0 being Not at All Preferred and 100 being Very Preferred. Visits are flexible, based on participant preference and may be completed any time between enrollment and end of study. Testing takes about 12 minutes.</description>
