  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in France (56,841 cases in 2012). Although the
      benefits of physical activity (PA) in cancer patients are currently well established in the
      scientific literature, several studies have shown that this population is not sufficiently
      active. Strengthen patient adherence to prevention counseling by the physical activity (PA)
      is emerging as a new challenge for personalized treatment in oncology. In order to encourage
      the engagement and maintenance in a regular PA of cancer patients, first, their experiences
      of physical activity (PA) practice should be considered and their initial social
      representations of the practice considered. Secondarily, it is also important to identify
      health professionals who retain a key role in defining the framework, objectives and means of
      action to promote lifestyle changes towards a more active lifestyle. In addition, peer
      mentoring appears to offer promising perspectives for promoting adherence and long-term
      maintenance in physical activity (PA) of cancer patients.

      The main objective of this project is to measure the adherence of prostate cancer patients to
      a physical activity program with a tracking of the motivation by a pair.
