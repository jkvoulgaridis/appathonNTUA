  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In 2001, the National Health Service of the Ministry of Health and Welfare
      promoted breastfeeding by adopting the ten measures of successful breastfeeding. However,
      there is still much room for improvement in Taiwan's continued breastfeeding rate. Currently,
      although the breastfeeding education is given since pregnancy, the postpartum women were
      still suffering from baby's and themselves demands, such as unfamiliar with breastfeeding
      skills, fatigue, discomfort. When the baby is crying, I don't know how to comfort, and I need
      help from others. The nursing staff cannot provide immediate assistance due to busy clinical
      work. It showed that it is very important to include the partners to provide assistance and
      support to postpartum women. The prenatal education for partners is the opportunity to
      elevate the partners' ability of baby care and support to mothers.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore whether different prenatal education courses
      increase the ability of prospective parents to breastfeed, infant care, and support, thereby
      improving the preparation and quality of life in the early postpartum period, reducing the
      incidence of postpartum depression, promoting the parenting of newborns, and Attachment Study
      design: This study adopts a class of experimental design, the study recruited pregnant women
      35 to 39 weeks of primipara and their spouses, the study subjects were divided into
      experimental group and control group, calculated by G*Power software, alpha is set as 0.05
      while power as 0.8. It should be 51 pair of parents in two groups in the third time point.
      Considering the possible attrition, the investigators will recruit 80 pairs of the
      experimental group and the control group, respectively. Data collection was conducted on the
      structured questionnaire on the prenatal, early postpartum, and one month postpartum to
      explore the effectiveness of different prenatal education courses for primiparas and their
      partners.

      Expected outcome: The prenatal education is expected to elevate the partners' ability of baby
      care and support to mothers in early postpartum, to decrease postpartum blue, and to promote
      the attachment between parents and newborns. The results of the questionnaire will be
      analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical analysis using the suite
      software SPSS 15.0 for Windows.

      This study adopts a quasi-experimental design. Eligible subjects are pregnant women 35 to 39
      weeks of primipara and their spouses. Specifically, inclusion criteria are (1) gestational
      age 35 to 39 weeks, (2) adults, (3) primipara and their spouses, (4) having routine prenatal
      visits and plan to have birth in the medical center, (5) able to communicate with Mandarin or
      Taiwanese, and (6) willing to participate in this study and give written inform-consent
      forms. Exclusion criteria are (1) having fetus with abnormality, (2) high-risk pregnancy, and
      (3) cannot room-in due to newborn's medical conditions. Participants would be assessed on the
      time points of recruitment (T1), early postpartum during hospitalization (T2), and one-month
      postpartum (T3).

      Before conducting this study, the institutional review board (IRB) has approved this study.
      The research staffs will approach potential participants during their prenatal visits and
      invite them to participate in the study. Potential participants would be informed of the
      study purposes, interventions (routine care for control group, routine care plus intervention
      for intervention group), and interview contents. After written consent is obtained, the
      interventions will be arranged. In order to control the quality of data collection, the
      investigators will train the research assistants. Research training will include ethical
      concerns about collection of research data, methods of approaching eligible subjects,
      interviewing techniques, and pilot testing of data collection. The training will provide
      research assistants by the PI and Co-PI of this study.

    <intervention_model_description>The study subjects will be divided into the experimental group and control group. In order to avoid the contamination between the control group and the experimental group due to the simultaneous empty space and information sharing, the control group will be recruited in the study in the first two months. After control group recruitment, we will recruit the intervention group and provide prenatal education.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes of Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Parents will be assessed the change among Gestational Week 35~39 (T1), postpartum 3~5 days (T2), and postpartum 1 month (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) measured the parents' attitude toward infant feeding with 17 Likert's scale items (Ho &amp; McGrath, 2011). Each item scored from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Items 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 17 will be reversed code. The higher score indicated the higher intention to choose breastfeeding; lower scores indicated the intention to choose formula feeding. Cronbach's alpha is 0.75.</description>

    <time_frame>Parents will be assessed the change among Gestational Week 35~39 (T1), postpartum 3~5 days (T2), and postpartum 1 month (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form measured the breastfeeding self-efficacy with 14 Likert's scale items (Dennis, 2003). Each item scored from 1 to 5 (1 = not at all confident, 5 = always confident). The total scores range from 14 to 70. The higher score indicates the higher levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Parents will be assessed the change among Gestational Week 35~39 (T1), postpartum 3~5 days (T2), and postpartum 1 month (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The Postpartum Partner Support Scale (PPSS) measured the prenatal/postpartum partner support perceived by postpartum women and reported by the partners with 20 Likert's scale items (Dennis, Brown, &amp; Brennenstuhl, 2017). Each item scored from 1 to 4 (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree). One item will be reverse-coded. The total score ranges from 20 to 80. The higher score indicated the higher postpartum partner support perceived by postpartum women or the partners. For T1, the description of measure item has been mild-modified to better reflect the prenatal status.</description>

    <time_frame>Parents will be assessed the change between postpartum 3~5 days (T2) and postpartum 1 month (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI) measured the maternal/paternal-infant attachment with 26 items (Lai, 2009; Muller, 1994).

    <time_frame>Parents will be assessed the change between postpartum 3~5 days (T2) and postpartum 1 month (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulty in Baby-Care Activities Scale (DIBCAS) measured the difficulties that parents faced in the baby-care activities (Lai, 2009). The 14 items included four aspects: infant feeding, clean &amp; comfort, safe &amp; healthy, and smoothing behaviors. Each item scored from 1 to 4 (1 = no difficulty at all; 2 = a little bit difficult, 3 = difficult, 3 = totally difficult). The higher score indicated the higher difficulty level the parents faced in baby-care activities. The Cronbach's alpha of the total scale is 0.91</description>

    <measure>Social Support Scale (SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Parents will be assessed at Gestational Week 35~39 (T1), postpartum 3~5 days (T2), and postpartum 1 month (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Support Scale (SSS) measured the social support perceived by the parents from their families and friends with 10 Likert's scale items (Hung, Stocker, &amp; Hsu, 2014). Social support is one of the control variables in this study. Each item scored from 1 to 5 (1 = never and 5 = always). The total score ranges from 10 to 50. The higher score indicated the better social support from families and friends. Cronbach's alpha is 0.92 for the whole scale and are 0.70-0.81 for subscales. Item-to-total correlations are 0.38-0.69. Factor analysis showed the two-factor structure, supporting the construction validity.</description>
