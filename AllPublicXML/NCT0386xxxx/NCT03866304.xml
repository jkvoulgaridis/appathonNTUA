    <description>Tattoo clearing as rated by blinded reviewers at 8 weeks post-final treatment (Physician's Global Assessment of Improvement).
Blinded reviewer will first be asked to determine the temporal order (before and after) of each photograph pair for each treatment side and then rate the degree of tattoo clearing observed in the after photograph (compared to before photograph) using the Physician's Global Assessment scale:
4 = Very Significant Clearing (&gt; 75%) 3 = Significant Clearing (51 - 75%) 2 = Moderate Clearing (26 - 50%)
1 = Mild Clearing (5 - 25%) 0 = No Change (&lt; 5%)</description>
