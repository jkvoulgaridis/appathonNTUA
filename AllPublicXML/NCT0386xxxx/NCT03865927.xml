  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial to test GKT137831 in ambulatory patients
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This drug is an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) isoforms. The investigators hypothesize the drug
      will decrease pulmonary injury due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NOX enzymes,
      which are believed to play an important role in the development of IPF. Treatment with
      GKT137831 could result in significant benefit for a lung disease that has, until now, been
      almost invariably inexorable.

      This clinical trial represents the bedside application of a series of NOX translational and
      basic studies and discoveries, over several years, from the laboratory of Dr. Victor
      Thannickal.

    <intervention_model_description>Following screening assessments, IPF patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments in a ratio of 1:1:
• Arm A (n=30) - GKT137831 Treatment:
GKT137831 will be administered orally, at a dose of 400 mg bid, for a total of 24 weeks.
• Arm B (n=30) - Placebo Treatment:
Arm B subjects will receive matching placebo for the same duration.
Participants will be followed in face-to-face visits with trial personnel every 6 weeks for 24 weeks to assess drug effects and monitor safety during their treatments, and by phone surveillances one month thereafter.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 40-85 years old.

          2. A diagnosis of IPF that fulfills current American Thoracic Society (ATS) Consensus
             Criteria.

          3. IPF duration &lt;5 years, based on the date of definitive diagnosis.

          4. Ability and willingness to give informed consent and adhere to study requirements.

          5. Ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) &gt;70%
             of predicted values

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of major comorbidities expected to interfere with study participation

          2. History of malignancy, excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer and low-risk
             prostate cancer, the latter defined as stage T1 or T2a, with prostate specific antigen
             &lt;10 ng/dl. NOX inhibition is not known to promote cancer, and these criteria are
             within current guidelines.

          3. The occurrence of any acute infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy within 2
             weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          4. Treatment for &gt;14 days within the preceding month with &gt;20 mg. prednisone (or
             equivalent) or any treatment during the last month with a cellular immunosuppressant
             (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors, etc.), given increased
             risks of opportunistic infections.

          5. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of Screening (Visit 1) or 5
             half-lives of the investigational medicinal product (whichever is longer).

          6. Fertile women who do not agree to contraception or abstinence, or who are breast
             feeding. IPF is a disease of older adults, and male predominant, so this will not be a
             frequent consideration.

          7. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to GKT137831 or its excipients (e.g. capsule
             &quot;bulking&quot; agents).

          8. A history of bone marrow disorder including aplastic anemia, or marked anemia defined
             as hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL (or 6.2 mmol/L).

          9. Severe cardiovascular disease, defined as any of the following within the preceding 12
             weeks: acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, a coronary revascularization
             procedure, congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), or stroke, including a
             transient ischemic attack.

         10. Evidence of cardiac conducting abnormalities, defined as second or third degree
             atrial-ventricular (AV) block not successfully treated with a pacemaker, or a personal
             or family history of long QT syndrome (QTc interval &gt;450 msec for males or 470 msec
             for females).

         11. End-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.

         12. Undergoing transplantation evaluation, or listed with the United Network for Organ
             Sharing (UNOS) as a lung transplantation candidate at the time of enrollment in this
             trial.

         13. Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin)
             &gt;3x upper limit of normal values
