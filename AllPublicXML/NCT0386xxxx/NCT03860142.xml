  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral disorders are currently widely described in the premature birth population, but few
      studies compare them to their prevalence in the full-term population.

      In addition, new behaviours and eating habits are regularly emerging in our society.

      The objective of this study is to compare the severity of signs of oral disorders between the
      group of preterm infants and the group of term infants born without organic pathologies that
      compromise oral development.

    <description>The severity of the signs of food orality disorders is assessed by Archet Scale, which makes it possible to establish a score out of 20. The severity of the signs is divided into four classes according to the following scores: from 0 to 5 = zero to low grade, from 6 to 10 = light grade, from 11 to 15 = moderate grade, from 16 to 20 = severe grade</description>
