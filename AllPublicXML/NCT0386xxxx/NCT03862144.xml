      This study evaluates if the activity of one-day of NEPA plus dexamethasone, to prevent
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant
      AC-based chemotherapy, is maintained during all the chemotherapy cycle treatment (maximum 4
      cycles).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the study should be treated with the following antiemetic prophylaxis,
      during all the AC-based chemotherapy cycles, up to a maximum of 4 cycles:

        -  NEPA will be administered orally at the dose of 300 mg netupitant/0.5 palonosetron 1
           hour before the start of any chemotherapy cycle.

        -  Dexamethasone 12 mg will be added on day 1 only of each cycle.
