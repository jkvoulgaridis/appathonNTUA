  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy toriplimab
      (anti-PD-1 mAb) combined with thermal ablation in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
      (HCC).

      1.1 Primary Objective &amp; Hypothesis Determine the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA)/microwave ablation (MWA) followed by toripliamab for unresectable HCC by
      establishing the rates of toxicity that occur within 6 months after ablation. Hypothesis:
      Thermal ablation followed by toriplimab will have similar toxicity to toriplimab monotherapy.
      Thermal ablation enhances antitumor immune response and improves the best overall response
      rate compared to historical controls with toriplimab alone.

      1.2 Secondary Objectives and Hypotheses Estimate the progression-free survival, and overall
      survival. Hypothesis: Disease control and survival will be better than that observed with
      toriplimab monotherapy.

      1.3 Exploratory Objectives Explore changes in inflammatory biomarkers (including, but not
      limited to CD8/Treg ratio, total CD4 counts, total lymphocyte count) in pretreatment and
      on-treatment serially collected peripheral blood samples. Hypothesis: Changes in inflammatory
      biomarkers after thermal ablation may correlate with a more favorable response to
      immunotherapy.
