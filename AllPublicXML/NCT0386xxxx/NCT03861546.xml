  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pre-post pilot study is a 16 week lifestyle program for South Asians with prediabetes or
      diabetes in Atlanta. Patients will participate in physician-led group visits every other week
      focused on improving dietary and exercise practices to reduce weight.

    <description>South Asian (SA) adults with prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) that are 'information rich' and have variation in background characteristics will be identified. Dyads (spouses, parent/adolescent or young adult child, peers) will participate in a 16-week culturally-tailored, community-informed pre-post SMA intervention to improve health behaviors.</description>

    <description>Social network-based, culturally-tailored healthy lifestyle SMA program for high risk SAs will be piloted to collect pre-post data on diet and exercise habits, and to determine feasibility and acceptability. Patients will participate in physician-led group visits every other week focused on improving dietary and exercise practices to reduce weight. Biometric measurements (weight, height, blood pressure) will be collected, point of care glucose and lipid testing will be done.</description>
