  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Number of elderly patients requiring general anesthesia for major surgical procedures is
      increasing dramatically. It is estimated that 20% of these patients will develop major
      complications after surgery. Monitoring brain oxygen saturation may be helpful in reducing
      the postoperative complication rates. A decrease in brain oxygen is a sign that all other
      vital organs such as kidneys, heart, liver, and intestines have reduced blood supply and are
      starved from oxygen. This happens in 1 out of 5 patients undergoing major complex surgeries.
      Brain oxygen saturation monitor at this time is not used routinely during surgery, primarily
      due to the added cost, as well as, insufficient evidence that restoring the brain oxygen
      saturation to baseline would result in better outcomes. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      either study or control groups. In the study group, a special algorithm will be used to
      restore brain oxygen saturation. In the control group, the brain oxygen saturation will be
      monitored continuously, but the monitor screen will be electronically blinded, and standard
      clinical care applied. The objective of this study is to see if restoring the brain oxygen
      saturation to baseline results in less complication rates after surgery.

      The objective of this study is to reduce the incidence of postoperative morbidity due to end
      organ dysfunction after major non-cardiac surgery in elderly patients.

      The primary aim is to determine if restoration of rSO2 to baseline levels results in reduced
      incidence of major organ morbidity and mortality (MOMM).

      A secondary aim is to determine a cost-effectiveness of this monitoring modality.

      The investigator will collect delirium, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial
      infarction (troponin essays), pulmonary embolism (clinical, echocardiography and computer
      tomography assessments), renal failure (creatinine increase by at least 50% from baseline),
      pneumonia (clinical, X-ray), atrial fibrillation (documented electrocardiogram), bleeding
      requiring a transfusion of more than or equal to 4 units of red blood cells within 72 hours
      of surgery, mechanical ventilation for 2 days, major wound disruption, surgical site
      infection, sepsis, septic shock, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (vasoactive
      medication requirement), unplanned return to the operating room, and vascular graft failure,
      for the duration of hospital stay, as well as, all-cause 30-day mortality. Frailty scale &amp;
      DASI questionnaires will be administered at screening visit. Postoperative quality of
      recovery score (QoR-15) with be performed at baseline, POD 1 &amp; 5 (discharge if earlier)].
      Disability Free Survival (DFS) at 6 months (administer WHODAS).

    <description>A composite outcome will be assessed as a dichotomous outcome. (YES or NO). All components of the composite outcome will be weighted equally. They will include the following outcomes: postoperative delirium assessed with Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), Stroke assessed clinically, Transient Ischemic Attacks assessed clinically, Myocardial infarction, Pulmonary Embolism, Renal failure, Pneumonia, Atrial fibrillation, bleeding, mechanical ventilation for â‰¥48 hours, Major wound disruption, Surgical site infection, Sepsis, Septic shock, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, Vascular graft failure.

    <description>Bilateral NIRS (Masimo, O3TM Regional Oximetry) will be used to measure rSO2 intraoperatively.
In the interventional group, an alarm threshold at 90% of the baseline rSO2 value will be established. Based on predetermined algorithm the rSO2 will be maintained at or above 90% of the baseline measurements. The intervention will be commenced within 15 seconds of the reduction in rSO2 value.</description>
