  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the first year of this three-year plan is to analyze and compare the muscle
      quality of lower limb muscle (microcirculation, muscle performance and mechanical
      characteristics) and maximal aerobic exercise capacity in treadmill exercise tests for
      diabetic and non-diabetic cases. The hypotheses are:1) the muscle quality of lower limb
      muscle and maximal aerobic exercise capacity are different between participate with diabetic
      and non-diabetic, 2) the effect of the three-month aerobic exercise intervention or home
      exercise on the characteristics of the muscle quality are different , and 3) intrinsic
      factors (such as age, BMI, and HDL) and characteristics of specific FTO genes are influenced
      the training outcomes.

      Participants with diabetes will attend an 12-week aerobic exercise intervention or home
      exercise if the exercise test result of the maximum rate of oxygen consumption is fair or
      poor. Assessments will be taken before and after the training program, which including muscle
      strength, stiffness, quality, microcirculation and exercise capacity. Comparisons between the
      pre-training and post-training condition will be made for each groups. And the assessments
      also compare with the healthy control group.

    <intervention_model_description>his study is going to recruit subjects with and without type 2 diabetes and age between 30 and 70 years old. This study will be focused on the effects of diabetes on maximum aerobic exercise intensity (VO2max) and muscle quality including microcirculation (by NIRS), mechanical properties (by elastography) and isometric strength in different age groups, and observe whether these results are related to the clinically relevant findings of diabetes. This study will recruit qualified diabetic subjects according to their results of maximal aerobic exercise capacity (VO2max) and assign them into two groups; aerobic exercise or home exercise intervention.</intervention_model_description>
