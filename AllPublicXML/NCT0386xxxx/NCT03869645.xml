    <description>Evaluation of quality of life (QoL) before and after treatment based on VEINES survey responses. Eight (8) QoL questions related to the patient's leg problems are evaluated and their scores aggregated into a single QoL score. The resultant aggregated QoL range is from 26 - 108 where the higher the number the higher the quality of life.</description>
