    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, open label Phase I/II trial.

        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lintuzumab-Ac225 added to venetoclax
           for patients with CD33 positive relapsed/refractory AML. (Phase 1 portion)

        2. To assess the percentage of patients with CR, CRh, or Overall Response (CR + CRh), up to
           6 months after the start of treatment without receiving other AML therapies. (Phase 2
           portion)

    <description>Lintuzumab-Ac225 administered on Day 1 of each cycle for four cycles (unless in the 0.5 μCi/kg or 0.25 μCi/kg cohorts, where there is a potential for an additional four cycles, pending PI and Medical Monitor review).
Venetoclax taken on Days 1-21 of each cycle for up to 12 cycles.
Each cycle is 28 days, with a potential to expand to 42 days to allow for full hematologic recovery.</description>

There will be a ramp up of venetoclax dosing in the first cycle, with 100 mg administered on Day 1, 200 mg on Day 2, and 400 mg on Day 3 and Day 4 and later. Patients on antifungal azoles should receive one-half these doses, up to a maximum of 200 mg of venetoclax.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractory or relapsed AML which will include:

               1. Refractory disease will be defined as at least 1 prior treatment with no
                  remission.

               2. Relapsed disease will be defined as 5% or more blasts in bone marrow seen after
                  remission.

               3. Patients with AML arising from myelodysplastic syndromes (including CMML) or
                  myeloproliferative neoplasms (secondary AML, ts-AML) are also eligible.

          2. Circulating blast count ≤ 200/μL within 10 days prior to first cycle of treatment.
             Hydroxyurea should be used to keep the peripheral blast count ≤ 200/μL until the first
             day of protocol treatment, to the extent that this is possible

          3. ECOG ≤ 2

          4. Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min

          5. AST and ALT ≤ 3.0 x ULN

          6. Bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active CNS Leukemia.

          2. Known HIV infection or known hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (with a detectable
             viral load).

          3. Participant has received strong and/or moderate CYP3A inducers within 7 days prior to
             the initiation of study treatment.

          4. Have received prior radiation to maximally tolerated levels to any critical normal
             organ.

          5. Clinically significant cardiac disease.

          6. Active, uncontrolled serious infection.

          7. Have other non-myeloid malignancy within 2 years of entry (with exceptions).

          8. Psychiatric disorder that would preclude study participation

          9. Previous solid organ transplant (prior treatment with SCT is allowed but not if
             patient has GVHD or is still receiving immunosuppression/GVHD therapy).
