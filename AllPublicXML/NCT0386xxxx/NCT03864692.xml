  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia for caesarean section is associated with a decrease in systemic vascular
      resistance and cardiac output and may cause hypotension in a significant portion of the
      parturients. Hypotension during delivery may cause maternal and fetal complications. If
      parturients who are likely to develop hypotension after spinal anesthesia can be identified
      before surgery, anesthesiologists would have opportunity to take measures such as
      prophylactic vasopressor administration.

      Perfusion index (PI) measured by pulse oximetry reflects vasomotor tone which affects the
      degree of hypotension after spinal anesthesia. This is a non-invasive method of assessing the
      relative vascular tone with the use of pulse oximeter which calculates the ratio of pulsatile
      versus the non-pulsatile component of the blood flow. A lower PI indicates greater peripheral
      vasomotor tone.

      Pleth variability index (PVI) is calculated using maximum and minimum values of perfusion
      index during respiratory cycles. PVI is one of the dynamic indices that can predict fluid
      responsiveness.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the PI and PVI values at different patient
      positions can predict hypotension during caesarean section.
