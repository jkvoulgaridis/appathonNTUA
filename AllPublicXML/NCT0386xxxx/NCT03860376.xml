  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized feasibility study. Freshly isolated tumor cells
      from patients will be screened using state-of-the-art viability assay designed for ex vivo
      high-throughput drug sensitivity testing (DST). In addition, genetic information will be
      obtained from cancer and normal (germline) tissue and correlated with drug response. This
      study will provide the platform for informing treating physician about individualized
      treatment options. The main outcome of this study will be the proportions of the patients
      whose treatment was guided by the personalized medicine approach.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study is to determine feasibility of
      providing pediatric cancer patients with access to personalized treatment options and
      clinical management recommendations based on ex vivo drug sensitivity testing (DST) and
      genomic profiling.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: The secondary objective of the study is to compare individual outcomes
      (response and disease-free survival) in patients with pediatric cancers treated with
      DST-guided therapy as compared to non-DST guided (conventional) therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE: To explore associations between genetic abnormalities in malignancies
      and ex vivo drug response.

    <description>This study will be considered successful (feasibility demonstrated) if it is possible to choose and initiate a combination drug regimen within 4 weeks in at least 10 out of 16 patients (62.5%). With that outcome, we would be 90% confidence that the true feasibility rate is at least 43% (90% CI: 0.425, 0.824).</description>
