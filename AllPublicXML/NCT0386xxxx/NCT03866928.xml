        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be required to satisfy the following criteria:

          1. Healthy male subject, aged between 18 and 45 years inclusive.

          2. Considered as healthy after a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical
             history and complete physical examination).

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m² inclusive.

          4. Normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) at the screening visit after 5 min in
             supine position:

               -  90 mmHg ≤ Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≤ 145 mmHg,

               -  45 mmHg ≤ Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≤ 90 mmHg,

               -  40 bpm ≤ HR ≤ 90 bpm,

               -  Or considered not clinically significant (NCS) by the Investigator.

          5. Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) recording on a 10 min resting 12-lead ECG at the
             screening visit:

               -  120 ≤ interval between P and R waves (PR) &lt; 210 ms,

               -  Interval between Q and S waves (QRS) &lt; 120 ms,

               -  Fridericia corrected interval between Q and T waves (QTcF) ≤ 450 ms,

               -  No sign of any trouble of sinusal automatism,

               -  Or considered NCS by the Investigator.

          6. Laboratory parameters within the normal range of the laboratory (hematological, blood
             chemistry tests, urinalysis). Individual values out of the normal range can be
             accepted if judged clinically non relevant by the Investigator.

          7. Normal dietary habits.

          8. Has given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All the subjects included in the study must not meet any of the following non-inclusion
        criteria.

          1. Unsuitable veins for repeated venipuncture.

          2. Any relevant history or presence of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastro-intestinal,

             herbal products that could affect the outcome of the study, within 2 weeks prior to
             the first drug administration or less than 5 times the t1/2 of that drug, whichever is
             longer,

         11. Who receive carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital known to affect hepatic
             metabolism within 1 month prior to the first dose administration,

         12. Who receive any drug known to interfere with CYP enzymes within 1 month prior to the
             first dose administration,

         13. History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse (alcohol consumption &gt; 4 glasses per day
             (1 glass is approximately equivalent to: beer [354 mL], wine [118 mL], or distilled
             spirits [29.5 mL]) per day)),

         14. Excessive consumption of beverages with xanthine bases (&gt; 5 cups or glasses / day),

         15. Current use of nicotine containing products, i.e., more than 5 cigarettes or
             equivalent/day or the inability to stop using nicotine containing products during
             confinement in the clinical center,

         16. Intake of any food or any beverage containing grapefruit or grapefruit juice within
             one week prior to the first dosing and the inability to stop such intake during the
