  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are blood thinners. People with HIV may need to take them to treat
      or prevent blood clots. The anti-HIV drug darunavir (DRV) can increase the amount of these
      blood thinners in the body. This can cause bleeding or other health problems. The drug
      cobicistat (COBI) is used to help anti-HIV drugs work better. Researchers want to give
      healthy people DRV combined with COBI to learn how it affects rivaroxaban or apixaban blood
      levels.

      Objective:

      To test blood levels of rivaroxaban or apixaban when taken with COBI and DRV/COBI.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy volunteers ages 18-65

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Fasting blood and urine tests. (Urine tests will be performed in females of child-bearing
      potential only)

      Participants will have 8 visits; 3 are long (about 10-12 hours) and 5 are about 1 hour. They
      include:

      Baseline and final visits:

      Fasting blood and urine tests

      Day 1 visit (long day):

      Fasting blood and urine tests

      Catheter placement: A needle will insert a small tube into the participant s arm vein. Blood
      will be drawn up to 10 times.

      Dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban

      Day 2 visit (short day):

      &lt;TAB&gt;Fasting blood tests

      Dose of COBI

      Participants will receive a bottle containing COBI tablets to take at home.

      Day 7 (long day):

      Fasting blood and urine tests

      Catheter placement: A needle will insert a small tube into the participant s arm vein. Blood
      will be drawn up to 10 times.

      &lt;TAB&gt;Dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban

      &lt;TAB&gt;Dose of COBI

      Day 8 (short day):

      Fasting blood tests

      Dose of DRV/COBI

      Participants will receive a bottle containing DRV/COBI tablets to take at home.

      Day 13 (long day):

      Fasting blood and urine tests

      Catheter placement: A needle will insert a small tube into the participant s arm vein. Blood
      will be drawn up to 10 times.

      &lt;TAB&gt;Dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban

      &lt;TAB&gt;Dose of DRV/COBI

      Day 14 (short day):

      Fasting blood tests

      Participants will take COBI tablets daily at home on days 3-6, and DRV/COBI on days 9 -12
      during the study. They will record doses and side effects.

      During the study, participants cannot:

      Take most medications.

      Drink alcohol, smoke, or vape

      Engage in activities such as contact and extreme sports

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used for the prevention and
      treatment of various thromboembolic disorders. Predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties, coupled with a few drug-drug and food-drug interactions,
      distinguishes DOACs from traditionally used anticoagulant - warfarin, allowing fixed dosing
      without routine coagulation monitoring. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are
      living as long as their HIV negative counterparts due to safe and efficacious antiretroviral
      therapy (ART). Persons with HIV are at higher risk for thromboembolic events and DOACs are a
      feasible option for anticoagulation in this population. However, there is a lack of drug
      interaction and safety data currently on the co-administration cobicistat (COBI)-boosted
      antiretroviral (ARV) regimens with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are
      both metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme (CYP) 3A4 and their absorption is modulated by
      permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), both of which are inhibited by the PK booster COBI. It is
      therefore possible that plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and apixaban may be
      significantly increased when co-administered together with COBI. This is of clinical concern
      as increased anticoagulant exposure may result in bleeding without the security of routine
      clinical monitoring. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of steady state
      concentrations of COBI and DRV/COBI on the PK and PD of single oral doses of rivaroxaban and
      apixaban.
