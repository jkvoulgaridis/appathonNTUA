  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to show that a wearable compliant arm support consisting of inflatable
      bladders with adjustable straps to connect them to the waist and arm can meaningfully
      increase the reachable workspace of persons with post-stroke arm weakness.

    <description>We will measure the reachable workspace of post-stroke participants without support from the compliant arm support as a baseline measurement using a PhaseSpace motion capture system or pose estimation software. These measurements will be recorded as an area (in square centimeters or meters). We will repeat these measurements with the compliant arm support and at prespecified time points after removing the arm support. We will report the percent change from the baseline measurement in reachable work space.</description>
