      This study will examine the effects of a school based exercise programme on anxiety and
      behaviour levels in children with autism. Local special autism schools and primary and
      secondary schools with specialised classes for children with autism will be approached to
      participate in the project. The age profile of the children will be 4-18 yrs of age and they
      will have mild-severe levels of autism. The exercise programme will delivered 3 times per
      week in the schools over periods of 8-16 weeks dependent on the severity of autism within the
      children.

      Questionnaires will be given to the parents and teachers of the children at the beginning and
      at the end of the programme to assess changes in anxiety levels and behaviour as a result of
      the exercise programme.
