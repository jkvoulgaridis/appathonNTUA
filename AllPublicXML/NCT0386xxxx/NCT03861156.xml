      A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of D-0316 in
      Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has
      Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy
      and whose Tumours are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of D-0316
      (Firstly, D-0316 was orally given 75mg for a cycle(21 days), if tolerated, the dose will be
      increased to 100mg. Otherwise, the dose will be maintained at 75mg.) in patients with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation
      positive NSCLC,who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. The primary objective of the
      study is to assess the efficacy of D-0316 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according
      to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
