  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of M254 after administration of a single ascending dose and repeat doses in
      healthy volunteers and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients. The pharmacodynamics
      of the drug will be measured as platelet response in patients with ITP.

        Key Criteria for Healthy Volunteers: Subject must be between the ages of 18 and 55 years;
        healthy as indicated by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical
        laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram, and all abnormal findings are assessed as
        not clinically significant by the Investigator; not pregnant or breastfeeding; and no other
        clinically relevant abnormalities currently or in their history that the Investigator would
        deem them ineligible to participate.

        Key Criteria for Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Patients: Patient must be between
        the ages of 18 to 64 years and diagnosed with ITP at least 3 months prior to screening,
        stable maintenance therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to the first study visit, not
        pregnant or breastfeeding, and no other clinically relevant abnormalities currently or in
        their history that the Investigator would deem them ineligible to participate.
