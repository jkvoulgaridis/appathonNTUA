  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin has been used clinically for over 50 years, as a glucose lowering agent.

      Direct and indirect anti-inflammatory effects of metformin have been reported in animal and
      clinical studies, and this effect is independent of its hypoglycemic effect.

      Animal studies showed that metformin decreased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level in
      atherogenic rabbits and decreased proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in obese mice .

      Moreover, metformin also suppressed osteoclastogenesis ; this may partially result from
      decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines that promote osteoclastogenesis in the
      arthritic joint.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of addition of metformin
      to standard disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>disease activity scale in 28 joints ( DAS-28)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>scale assessing severity of rheumatoid arthritis based on number of tender , swollen joints , ESR levels ,and patient self-assessment of his condition (global health assessment) . Whereas &quot;28&quot; describes the number of different joints including in the measurement :proximal interphalangeal joints (10 joints),metacarpophalangeal joints (10),wrists (2),elbows (2),shoulders (2),knees (2).
DAS28 values range from 2 to 10 while higher values mean a higher disease activity. A DAS-28 value &lt; 2.6 corresponds to remission,value between 2.6 and 3.2 corresponds to a low disease activity, value between 3.2 and 5.1 corresponds to a moderate disease activity, and DAS28 value &gt;5.1 corresponds to a high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>The HAQ (Health Assessment Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Score- Disability index), in which patients are asked to rate their capacity to perform 20 activities of daily living (ADL). Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). For each section the score given to that section is the worst score within the section, The Standard Disability Index (DI) calculated as the sum of the scores for various subscales divided by the number of subscales responded to, and results in a score between 0 and 3.Whereas scores can be interpreted as:
From 0 to 1: mild difficulties to moderate disability, 2: moderate, 3: severe to very severe disability.</description>
