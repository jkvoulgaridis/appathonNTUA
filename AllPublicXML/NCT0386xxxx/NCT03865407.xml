      Aim 1. To determine the effect of Allopurinol treatment on renal function (glomerular
      filtration rate, GFR) in pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with high uric acid
      levels (hyperuricemia).

      Aim 2. Establish whether Allopurinol treatment reduces Nlrp3 inflammasome and renal injury
      biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid levels often rise when kidney function declines. Historically, high uric acid has
      not been treated unless the uric acid crystallizes in the joint space and causes clinical
      gout disease, more typically seen in adults. However, new research has shown that high uric
      acid levels are associated with the development of hypertension, inflammation, and both acute
      and chronic kidney injury. Adult patients on renal dialysis who have hyperuricemia also have
      higher mortality rates. In several adult and in one pediatric clinical trial of uric acid
      lowering therapy (with Allopurinol or Febuxostat), treatment has demonstrated a slower rate
      of renal function decline and improved blood pressure compared to placebo. The pediatric
      trial was a 4-month placebo controlled trial of Allopurinol, and showed positive improvement
      in renal function and blood pressure, but did not adequately control for potential
      confounders in the outcome. Two known confounders that influence renal function (glomerular
      filitration rate, GFR) in pediatric CKD are race and glomerular or non-glomerular disease
      etiology. This study is designed to control for these confounders and establish whether
      Allopurinol for 6 months of treatment to a goal range of 3-5 mg/dL will improve renal
      function compared to standard of care. The secondary outcome is to determine whether blood
      pressure is affected by the treatment and the magnitude of change of serum uric acid. This
      study will also explore whether Allopurinol treatment alters activation of the Nlrp3
      inflammasome or renal injury biomarkers.
