    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well curcumin works in reducing joint pain in patients who are
      breast cancer survivors and have joint disease caused by treatment with aromatase inhibitors.
      Curcumin is an ingredient of turmeric, a plant in the ginger family, which is commonly used
      in curries and South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking, and may decrease joint pain in
      patients with arthritis from other conditions (such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
      arthritis).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine
      Symptoms (FACT-ES) scores to detect changes in AI-induced symptoms and well-being in
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer at 3 months of nanoemulsion curcumin (NEC) vs placebo

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Brief Pain Inventory, and
      Geriatric Assessment as secondary tools for monitoring AI-induced symptoms and well-being II.
      To evaluate adherence to a regimen of NEC vs placebo by postmenopausal women experiencing
      joint arthropathy induced by aromatase inhibitor therapy III. To obtain preliminary data
      regarding function in women with AI induced arthropathy (IA) by monitoring grip strength at 0
      and 3 months of NEC versus placebo IV. To conduct exploratory analyses of blood based
      biomarkers in postmenopausal women with AI-induced arthropathy taking NEC vs placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nanoemulsion curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 3
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for up to 3 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>The study will assess the feasibility of using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) to detect changes in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-induced symptoms and well-being in postmenopausal women with breast cancer randomized to 3 months of nanoemulsion curcumin (NEC) versus (vs) placebo capsules.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scores obtained from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and BPI, and FACT-ES assessments will be plotted over time for each arm. The agreement between these instruments will be evaluated using Altman and Bland plot after proper data transformation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post study-drug assessment</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Joint symptoms occurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will use logistic regression models to compare the occurrence of moderate to severe joint symptoms during the 3 month period between the two study groups, with potential covariates including geriatric assessment (GA), age, body mass index, baseline pain scores (0 month), prior chemotherapy e.g. taxanes, time to menopause/ovarian suppression. Summary statistics will be generated using the data obtained from the T0 and T3 study visits where grip strength dynamometry completed. Temporal as well as other relevant correlations between the data and the validated assessment scores will be determined.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood based biomarker analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will explore the relationship between specific inflammatory blood markers, grip strength, and the joint symptoms evaluated by the patient reported outcome measures. The relationship between plasma curcumin and these measures will also be evaluated. Scatter plots and correlation coefficients (either Pearson or Spearman) will be used to summarize their pair wise relation. The differences between the treatment and placebo in terms of these measures will also be reported using numerical summaries and graphic plots.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence rates will be examined using pill counts each month and patient recorded daily logs. Plasma curcumin will be compared to daily logs and pill count data as another potential measure of adherence.</description>
