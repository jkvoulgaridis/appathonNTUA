  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NIS is a composite neurologic impairment score that assesses motor weakness (NIS-W), sensation (NIS-S) and reflexes (NIS-R) by physical exam. The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 244, respectively. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Norfolk QoL-DN questionnaire is a standardized 35-item patient-reported outcomes measure that is sensitive to the different features of diabetic neuropathy - small fiber, large fiber, and autonomic nerve function. The minimum and maximum values are -4 and 136, respectively. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Rasch-Built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The R-ODS is comprised of a 24-item linearly weighted scale that specifically captures activity and social participation limitations. The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 48, respectively. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS-31) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The COMPASS-31 questionnaire is a measure of autonomic neuropathy symptoms. The questions evaluate 6 autonomic domains (orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupillomotor). The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 100, respectively. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>
