      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of a combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin,
      and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) for treatment of patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC).

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, clinical study to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of a combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin,
      and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFOX-nal-IRI) for treatment of patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Each subject will be screened for eligibility by evaluation
      including medical history, physical examination, performance status, blood tests, computed
      tomographic (CT) scans, and electrocardiogram. Within 28 days of screening, the consented
      subjects will have a central venous access device placed and then start treatment.

      For every 2-week cycle of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, each subject will receive nal-IRI (irinotecan free
      base 50 mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes), oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2 intravenously over 2
      hours), leucovorin (400 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours), and 5-fluorouracil 2,400 mg/m2
      intravenously over 46 hours).

      Tumor response will be evaluated every 4 cycles of treatment with CT scans using RECIST 1.1
      criteria. If the tumor becomes surgically resectable and the subject is a surgical candidate
      as determined by a multidisciplinary team, the subject will undergo surgery (at which point
      he/she would enter survival follow-up). If the tumor remains unresectable and there is no
      tumor progression, each subject will be treated up to a total of 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI.

      Following treatment with 12 cycles of FOLFOX-nal-IRI, if tumor remains unresectable, the
      subjects may receive further treatment (chemotherapy using the same regimen or of the
      treating physician's choice, or chemoradiation therapy) or observation as determined by the
      physician. During the course of treatment, if the subjects develop unacceptable toxicity
      and/or disease progression, the treatment will be discontinued, and the subjects will be
      further managed at the discretion of the treating oncologists.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of study registration and within 72 hours of Cycle 1 Day 1. NOTE: Female
             subjects are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile

             or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential and males must be willing to abstain from
             behaviors that could lead to pregnancy (heterosexual activity, sperm donation, in
             vitro fertilization, etc.) or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception
             from the time of informed consent until 180 days after treatment discontinuation. The

             subject should be able to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide a
             signed and dated informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to irinotecan liposome, other liposomal products, oxaliplatin,

             suspicion.

          -  Any medical condition, life-threatening illness, or organ dysfunction, which in the
             investigator's opinion, can compromise the subject's safety or put the study outcomes

          -  Uncontrolled active systemic infection.

          -  Concomitant medications that are prohibited in this study and they cannot be switched

          -  Known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive requiring treatment
             within 2 years of screening for this study; exceptions include basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical or bladder cancer, low-grade prostate cancer, or
             other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at least five years.
             Additional exceptions could be considered if agreed by sponsor-investigator and site
             investigator assuming the disease is considered extremely unlikely to confound
             evaluation of disease status.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration, or
