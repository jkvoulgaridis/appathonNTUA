  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADASCog11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance will be assessed by a psychometrician using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADASCog11). The ADAS-Cog is an Alzheimer's disease specific, multi-domain cognitive assessment scored from 0-70 points with higher scores indicating poorer cognitive performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global cognitive performance will be assessed by a psychometrician using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). The MMSE is a brief cognitive questionnaire with a maximum score of 30 points where higher scores indicate better cognitive performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance on the Logical Memory Test (LMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Logical Memory, subtest of the WMS-R is a standardized assessment of narrative episodic memory. A short story is orally presented, and the examinee is asked to recall the story immediately.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance by Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reaction time and accuracy will be assessed by a psychometrician using the Stroop test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating is a 5-point scale (CDR 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3) used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias. CDR 0 indicates no dementia and higher values indicate more severe dementia. The scores of all six domains are averaged to form a global CDR score. Change in score from baseline to 3 months will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cerebral concentration of N-Acetylaspartate (NAA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Concentration of cerebral N-Acetylaspartate is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a 3T clinical scanner.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood platelet mitochondrial function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Weeks, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cytochrome c oxidase activity of blood platelets will be determined as a pseudo first order-rate constant (sec-1/mg protein) by measuring the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported symptoms by study partner</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Weeks, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of symptoms will be measured via a self-reported symptoms questionnaire, answered by participant study partners.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood ketone levels induced by ketogenic diet</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Weeks, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of days positive for urinary ketone production</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 90 days (the length of the diet intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will measure and report daily urinary ketone status using Ketostix (Bayer, Germany).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake characterization prior to and after ketogenic diet initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Weeks, 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in food and nutrient intake will be assessed by monthly 3-day food records completed by participant study partners.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Study partners will be instructed to assist participants in adherence to a 1:1 ketogenic diet (approximately 70% fat, &lt;10% carbohydrate, and 20% protein as energy). The diet will encourage ≥4 servings of non-starchy vegetables and 1/2 cup of berries daily. Participants will be provided an emulsified medium chain triglyceride supplement with a target intake of 1-2 tablespoons per day and micronutrient supplements consisting of multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. After the 3-month ketogenic diet, participants will complete a 1-month washout period in which they halt adherence to the ketogenic diet and resume their normal diet.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Therapeutic Lifestyles Changes Diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Study partners will be instructed to assist participants in adherence to the Therapeutic Lifestyles Changes diet. The diet consists of 20-35% fat, 50-60% carbohydrate, and ~15% protein as energy. Fat intake will comprise &lt;7% saturated fat, ≤20% monounsaturated fat, and ≤10% polyunsaturated fat as total energy. Cholesterol consumption will be ≤200mg per day. Participants are encouraged to eat ≥2 servings of fruit and ≥5 servings of vegetables per day.</description>
