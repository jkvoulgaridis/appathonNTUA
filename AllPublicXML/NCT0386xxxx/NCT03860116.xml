  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial about an app-based case management intervention. The
      intervention is a comprehensive case management approach consisting of the following aspects:
      articles delivery, online communication with case managers, supportive service information
      and hospital visits reminders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      intervention among HIV-positive men who have sex with men compared to standard-of-care
      service.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) are one of the key populations in HIV epidemic. They are
      characterized by multiple risky sexual behaviors: unprotected anal/oral sex, commercial sex,
      sex during drug use and multiple partners sexual behavior. In the conservative context of
      Chinese culture, MSM face a wide variety of psychosocial barriers including: stigma, poor
      mental health and lack of social support. HIV-positive MSM, not only do they have to deal
      with external stress about their sexual preference, but they also face the pressure to hide
      their infection status to avoid discrimination. The aforementioned factors limit their
      adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART), and lead to suboptimal treatment outcome.
      Besides, due to the ART scale-up strategy in China, the existing health system is burdened
      with increasing numbers of patients, which calls for innovative patient management approach
      using mobile technology. Moreover, the needs of HIV/AIDS patients are growing complex. So,
      case management, a comprehensive service model, is adopted to meet the needs of patients with
      chronic illness, combined with smart phone application (APP) to improve adherence of
      HIV-positive Chinese men who have sex with men.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an APP-based case management approach on ART
      adherence. 600 participants will be recruited and randomized into intervention group or
      control group. The app is called &quot;Trusted Doctor&quot;. It allows communication between doctor and
      patient as well as online patient management including: sharing disease related knowledge,
      scheduling follow up questionnaire to collect patients' information, visits reminder, free
      phone calls with phone numbers encrypted. In this study, doctors download the APP, and
      participants in the intervention group will use Wechat to follow the platform which is
      connected to Trusted Doctor. Inc server and receive intervention. Wechat is a popular social
      media that not only allows instant messaging between users, but also provides individuals or
      groups the function of delivering articles or messages on their own Wechat platform to
      subscribers. By establishing a unique Wechat platform and link it with the APP, service and
      relative information can be provided on the daily communication tool. After being screened
      and informed consent, eligible participants will administer a baseline questionnaire on a
      tablet and then be randomized into intervention or control group. An identification number
      will be generated for each participant in this study. Then the intervention group will use
      Wechat to follow the platform and add contact of case managers. Tutoring about the function
      of the platform will be provided by investigators. Intervention in this study includes:
      articles delivery, online communication with case managers, supportive service information
      and hospital visits reminders. Both the intervention and control group will receive
      standard-of-care service in the hospital, including medication education after treatment
      initiation, physical examination and brief counselling scheduled at each hospital visits.
      Hospital visits are scheduled at month 1/2/3/6/12. Questionnaires are scheduled at baseline,
      month 1, 3, 6, and 12. Follow-up questionnaires will be delivered through Wechat. The primary
      outcome is ART adherence and CD4+ T cell count.

Anxiety will be measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, including 7 Likert-style items. Response options include &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;several days&quot;, &quot;more than half the days&quot;, &quot;nearly every day&quot;. Scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be assigned to the response categories, respectively. Cronbach's alpha was 0.92. Total score for the scale ranges from 0 to 21. Score will be categorized into 4 level to indicate anxiety level: minimal anxiety (0-4 points), mild anxiety (5-9 points), moderate anxiety (10-14), severe anxiety (15-21)</description>

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -9 is a 9-question instrument given to patients in a primary care setting to screen for the presence and severity of depression. The total of all 9 responses from the PHQ-9 aims to predict the presence and severity of depression. Questions are about the level of interest in doing things, feeling down or depressed, difficulty with sleeping, energy levels, eating habits, self-perception, ability to concentrate, speed of functioning and thoughts of suicide. Responses range from &quot;0&quot; (Not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). A total sum of the responses suggests varying levels of depression. Scores range from 0 to 27. Scores of 10 or higher is suggestive of the presence of depression, with higher score indicating more severe level of depression.</description>

The WHOQOL-HIV BREF is an abbreviated version instrument for evaluation of quality of life specifically designed for people with HIV or AIDS. It contains five extra items specific to PLWHA, and in total contains 31 items. Its items are rated on a 5-points Likert scale, and the available responses are 1 (not at all), 2 (a little) 3 (a moderate amount), 4 (very much) and 5 (an extreme amount). The WHOQOL-HIV BREF contains six domains (physical, psychological, independence, social relations, environment, spiritual/religion/person beliefs) and overall quality of life and general health perceptions. After reverse negatively phrased items, domains and facet scores are scaled in a positive direction where higher scores denote higher quality of life.</description>

The LW-IMB-AAQ was developed as a measure of barriers to antiretroviral therapy (ART)adherence among HIV+ patients in clinical care, following the constructs identified in the Information--Motivation--Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of adherence
The Information and Motivation subscale includes 19 and 10 Likert-style items, respectively. Response options include &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot;, &quot;Somewhat Disagree&quot;, &quot;Neither Agree nor Disagree&quot;, &quot;Somewhat Agree&quot;, and &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. Cronbach's alpha was 0.59 and 0.75 in a sample of youth living with HIV, respectively. Higher scores indicate greater knowledge and motivation of ART treatment.
This subscale includes 14 items. Cronbach's alpha was 0.90. Higher scores indicate greater motivation towards adherence.</description>

Case managers are request to respond to questions from participants as well as care about medication taking behaviors of each patients during the first month. Supportive service information, which include time, location and charges of service providers will be retrieved by participants, with reminders of available service information scheduled at the beginning of every month. Visit reminders are scheduled at one week before due date.</description>

    <description>When participants initiate HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART), they receive 20-minute ART-related education from the case managers, and have physical examination including blood test, CD4 count, hepatic and renal function tests. Subsequent visits are scheduled at month 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12. During each visit, pills enough to cover days until the next visit will be distributed. And patients will be asked about their medication adherence, high risk behavior and side effects experienced. Any relevant questions from patients will be answered. Physical tests are also included in the routine of each visits.</description>
