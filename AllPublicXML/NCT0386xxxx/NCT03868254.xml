  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective, non-interventional, observational, multi-center, chart review study to be
      conducted in participants who underwent placement of the XEN 45 Gel Stent as a standalone
      procedure or in combination with phacoemulsification from 1 January 2014 to 1 October 2015.

    <description>An AE of special interest (AESI) (serious or non-serious) is an AE specific to the sponsor's product or program (ocular events). Considering that study aims to explore occurrence over the long term of adverse events identified during clinical studies, this study will collect only AESIs already listed in the directions for use.</description>

    <description>Participants medical charts will be extracted until the target number of eyes for the primary analysis has been reached. A screening log for participants treated with XEN 45 Gel Stent on or after 1 January 2014 to identify eligible participants. For each eye selected, all retrospective data available from baseline (day when decision was made to implant XEN 45 Gel Stent) until Last Visit (date of the last follow-up visit available prior to 1 October 2018 or date on which the patient had an SSI for glaucoma, whichever occurs first) will be extracted from existing medical records.</description>
