    <textblock>
      Covered stents (CS) are a potentially lifesaving treatment for grade III coronary perforation
      but delivery can be challenging, and the long-term durability and safety including risk of
      acute stent thrombosis are unknown. The GNOCCI study aims to evaluate long term outcomes
      after coronary perforation including patients treated with covered stents.

      Covered stents (CS) are a potentially lifesaving treatment for grade III coronary perforation
      but delivery can be challenging, and the long-term durability and safety including risk of
      acute stent thrombosis are unknown. Using an electronic data base, details of all coronary
      perforations are identified and anonymised patient and procedural details are
      recorded.Procedural major adverse cardiac events (pMACE) are defined as a composite of death,
      myocardial infarction, stroke, target vessel revascularization or cardiac surgery within 24
      hours of the index procedure. Two independent cardiologists adjudicate outcomes and
      differences in opinion are resolved by consensus with a third cardiologist.

      The overall GNOCCI study aims are:

        1. Evaluate procedural and long term outcomes after coronary perforation

        2. Long term safety and clinical events in patients treated with covered stents.
