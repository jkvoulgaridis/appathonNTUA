  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a proof-of-concept, first in human, Phase I, single center study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and experimental efficacy of VLPM01 in
      healthy, malaria-naïve adult volunteers. The VLPM01 product will be adjuvanted with
      alhydrogel. The study design was based on the FDA's guidance &quot;General Principles for the
      Development of Vaccines to protect Against Global Infectious Diseases&quot; (2011).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have four (4) phases: Screening, Dose Escalation, Controlled Human Malaria
      Infection (CHMI) and Follow-Up. The study will be conducted at the Walter Reed Army Institute
      of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland (WRAIR), as this institute has extensive experience in
      conducting clinical studies of malaria vaccines with CHMI.

      A total of 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. Thirty (30) eligible participants
      will participate in the Dose Escalation Phase as vaccinees and 6 eligible participants will
      be added during the CHMI Phase to act as infectivity controls. Up to 6 additional eligible
      participants will serve as alternate vaccinees during the Dose Escalation Phase and up to 6
      eligible participants will as act as alternate infectivity controls during the CHMI Phase.
      Alternates are only enrolled if a designated vaccinee is not eligible on the day of first
      vaccination or if a designated infectivity control is not eligible on the Day of Challenge.
      Withdrawn participants will not be replaced.
