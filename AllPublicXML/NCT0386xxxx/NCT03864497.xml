  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal screening strategy for assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with
      end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is unclear. Although consensus based guidelines support
      noninvasive stress testing prior to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), no prospective
      studies are available to inform the clinician on perioperative risk stratification. This
      observational cohort study was designed to determine the prognostic utility of single photon
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in OLT candidates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controversy over whether SPECT imaging offers clinical utility in ESLD has been fuelled by
      conflicting reports on its accuracy to diagnose CAD in this setting. Moreover, there are no
      studies examining whether SPECT imaging provides any incremental prognostic value beyond
      functional testing in this high-risk cohort. We sought to determine the relative importance
      of CV risk factors, functional capacity and SPECT perfusion results as independent predictors
      of cardiovascular mortality in OLT candidates.

        Consecutive patients with end-stage liver disease were identified after referral to the
        Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham for CV risk stratification as part of a pre-transplant
        screening work-up. Subjects were referred for non-invasive CV risk assessment based on the
        above criteria.
