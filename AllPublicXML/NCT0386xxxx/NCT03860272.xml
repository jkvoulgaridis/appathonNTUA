  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      PK, and PD profiles of a novel Fc-engineered IgG1 anti-CTLA-4 human monoclonal antibody
      (AGEN1181) monotherapy and in combination with a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody (AGEN2034),
      and to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This
      study will also determine the RP2D of AGEN1181 monotherapy and in combination with AGEN2034.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study will enroll up to approximately 86 evaluable adult subjects with
      refractory cancer (solid tumors) regardless of diagnosis. Subjects may be enrolled into the
      following cohorts:

      Cohort 1: AGEN1181 every 3 weeks at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg Cohort 2: AGEN1181 every 6
      weeks at 1, 2, and 3 mg/kg Cohort 3: AGEN2034 every 2 weeks at 3 mgkg + AGEN1181 every 6
      weeks at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg

      The trial will consist of a 3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different dose levels of
      AGEN1181 monotherapy and in combination with AGEN2034. Each subject will stay on the dose
      level an schedule assigned at trial entry. Subjects can be replaced for any reason other than
      a DLT. Subjects will receive treatment for ≤ 2 years or until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or
      any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal of trial occurs.

             method for the subject.

         12. Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion in the trial, subject must meet none of the following exclusion criteria, as
        no waivers will be permitted:

          1. Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of
             an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigation device
             within 3 weeks of first dose of current study drug.

          2. Received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, biological therapy, or major surgery
             within 3 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. A 1-week washout is permitted for
             palliative radiation to non-CNS disease, with sponsor approval.

          3. Received prior therapy with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody or drug.

          4. Persistent toxicity of NCI CTCAE version 5.0 Grade &gt;1 severity that is related to
             prior therapy.

             Note: Sensory neuropathy or alopecia of grade ≤2 is acceptable.

          5. Expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy
             while on trial (including maintenance therapy with another agent, radiation therapy,
             and/or surgical resection).

          6. Known severe (grade ≥3) hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, antibody,
             or severe reaction to immuno-oncology agents, such as colitis or pneumonitis requiring
             treatment with steroids; or current or history of interstitial lung disease,
             anaphylaxis, uncontrolled asthma (i.e., ≥3 features of partly controlled asthma), or
             pneumonitis that has required oral or IV corticosteroids.

          7. Receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy 1 week prior to the first dose of study drug
             or receiving any other form of systemic immunosuppressive medication. Corticosteroid
             use as a premedication for IV contrast allergies/reactions is allowed. Subjects who
             are receiving daily corticosteroid replacement therapy are also an exception to this
             rule. Daily prednisone at doses of ≤7.5 mg or equivalent hydrocortisone dose are
             examples of permitted replacement therapy.

          8. CNS tumor, metastasis(es), and/or carcinomatous meningitis identified either on the
             baseline brain imaging obtained during the screening period or identified prior to
             consent.

             Note: Subjects with history of brain metastases that have been treated may participate
             provided they show evidence of stable supra-tentorial lesions at screening (defined as
             2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases and
             obtained ≥4 weeks apart). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either
             as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have returned to baseline
             or resolved. Any steroids administered as part of this therapy must be completed ≥3
             days prior to first dose of trial medication.

          9. Active or history of autoimmune disease that requires systemic treatment within 2
             years of the start of study drug (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents,
             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).

             Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

         10. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.

         12. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 antibodies.

         13. Known active infection with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus.

         14. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment, unstable
             angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥II), or serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.

         15. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         16. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial.

         17. Legally incapacitated or has limited legal capacity.

         18. Pregnant or breastfeeding.
