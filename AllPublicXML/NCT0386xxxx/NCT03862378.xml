    <textblock>
      In our previous study, a nomogram model was established to predict intra-abdominal infectious
      complications after gastrointestinal surgery. This model was based on the clinical data and
      the drainage fluid cytokine levels, and it received an AUC &gt;0.9. In this study, validation of
      this nomogram is planned to be conducted in this prospective cohort study.

    <textblock>
      Intra-abdominal infectious complications such as anastomotic leakage are the most feared but
      common complications after gastrointestinal surgery. In our previous study, a nomogram model
      was established to predict intra-abdominal complications after gastrointestinal surgery. This
      model was based on the clinical data and the drainage fluid cytokine levels, and it received
      an AUC &gt;0.9. A predicting score (i.e. APPEAL-GC score) was created based on the model. In
      this study, validation of this score in predicting intra-abdominal complications is planned
      to be conducted in this prospective cohort study.

      In this study, all patients undergoing gastric or colorectal cancer surgery with a primary
      anastomosis will be included. The clinical data and complication data will be prospectively
      collected; the discarded drainage fluid will be collected and analyzed afterward. No
      additional intervention will be applied.

      The cytokine levels in the drainage fluid will be evaluated, and together with the clinical
      data, an APPEAL-GC score will be created for each patient. We will investigate whether the
      above-mentioned score is able to predict the intraabdominal complications after surgery. The
      predictive value (clinical usefulness) of the score will be validated in this study.

    <description>The positive predictive value of the APPEAL-GC score in predicting the intra-abdominal infectious complications. Intra-Abdominal infectious complications include anastomotic leakage and other abdominal infectious complications. The complication definitions are in accordance with the Chinese consensus of gastrointestinal complication diagnosis and registration.
The APPEAL-GC score was derived from our recently finished study (unpublished). It includes evaluation of the surgical type (open or laparoscopic), resection range, age, and cytokine levels on the postoperative day 3. A score of each patient can be determined, and a pre-set cut-off value (unpublished data) was determined in our previous study based on the AUC analysis.
In this study, each patient will be scored accordingly. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the cut-off value will be evaluated.</description>

      In this study, we will collect the discarded drainage fluid for each patient for further
      analysis. The samples will be collected and stored in -80 refrigerators until analysis. The
      candidate targets include IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, MMP2, MMP9.

        This observational study intends to include all patients undergoing gastric or colorectal
        cancer with primary anastomosis. Because drainage fluid analysis is necessary for the
        prediction model, patients without the tube will be excluded.
