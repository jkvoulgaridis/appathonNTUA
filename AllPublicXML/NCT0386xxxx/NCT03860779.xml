  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nurse-administered propofol sedation has become the standard procedure for colonoscopy in
      Germany. Although patient satisfaction with this method is high, there is little data about
      the satisfaction of the examiner and factors that might negatively influence this
      satisfaction. Often due to the fact that the sedated patient usually expresses pain by
      movements of the body and paralinguistic sounds the examination has to pause until the next
      propofol bolus induces a deeper sedation. In order to measure the correlation of examiner
      satisfaction and negative factors the investigators initiated this prospective observational
      study. During this study examiner satisfaction and the correlation with observer reported
      pain (movements and paralinguistic sounds) will be measured. Additionally different
      biopotentials (electromyography, skin conductance level, body temperature, pulse) of the
      patient will be recorded during the examination and feature pattern will be correlated to the
      observer reported pain in order to detect pain before the expression of pain leads to a pause
      in the colonoscopy examination. Other factors that might influence examiner satisfaction,
      like duration to reach the caecum and duration of polypectomy will additionally be evaluated.
