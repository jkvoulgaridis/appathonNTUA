      The purpose of this research study is to determine if closing a surgical wound differently is
      better than the procedure that is currently used. The wound will be closed with what is
      considered &quot;tertiary intent.&quot; This means, rather than leaving the wound open, the wound will
      be partially closed after surgery, and then completely closed 4-7 days after surgery. The
      investigators also want to see how this new wound closure process affects your quality of
      life.

      Primary Objective

      To compare the percentage of patients whose wound remained closed on postoperative day #30
      after tertiary closure compared to historical controls who underwent secondary would closure.
      We are primarily looking at time to wound closure. We will be able to abstract this
      information from the postoperative clinic visit notes from patients in the &quot;historical
      control&quot; cohort. We will identify 20 patients with characteristics described in the inclusion
      criteria of this study who underwent laparotomy with secondary would closure during the
      calendar year 2018.

      Secondary Objectives

      To compare the proportion of acute and chronic wound infection in wounds closed with a
      tertiary closure technique to historical controls receiving a secondary wound closure.

      To compare the length of stay of patients receiving a tertiary wound closure to historical
      controls receiving a secondary wound closure.

      To describe the number of patients receiving a tertiary wound closure that return within 30
      days of surgery as compared to historical controls receiving a secondary wound closure.

      To describe the quality of life in patients receiving a tertiary wound closure.

    <description>The quality of life in patients receiving a tertiary wound closure. The scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>In the alternative tertiary wound closure, the wound will be partially closed rather than being left open. Sutures in the skin will be placed but not closed. A vacuum assisted closure device will be placed over the wound to help healing. After 4-7 days, the vacuum device will be removed, and the participant's doctor will close the wound.</description>
