  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 as single agent or in combination
      with HX008, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with malignant solid tumors (gastrointestinal
      cancers, head and neck cancers, soft tissue sarcomas).

      OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus
      type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the
      delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.

      The trial is a phase I study evaluating the safety and efficacy of OH2 injection in patients
      with malignant solid tumors.

      In the Phase I dose escalation trial, three doses (1x10e6, 1x10e7, 1x10e8 CCID50/mL) of OH2
      as single agent will be tested. 5 treatments of OH2 will be delivered by intratumoral
      injection. The Phase I dose expansion trial comprises of 3 cohorts. In cohort 1, patients
      will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose as defined in the Phase I escalation trial. In
      cohort 2, OH2 will be injected at three doses (1x10e6, 1x10e7, 1x10e8 CCID50/mL) in
      combination with HX008, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and the first doses of the two anti-tumor
      agents will be administered on the same day. The treatments in cohort 3 will be identical as
      in cohort 2, except that the first dose of HX008 will be administered at the time of the
      third dose of OH2. Blood samples will be collected and radiological imaging will be performed
      to evaluate safety and efficacy during the trial. Besides, patients will be subjected to
      cutaneous swabs, and blood/urine/feces sampling to determine virus shedding. Participating
      patients will be evaluated for objective response rate, progression free survival and overall
      survival.
