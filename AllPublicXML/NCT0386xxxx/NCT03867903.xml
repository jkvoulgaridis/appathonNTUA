      A single site, cross-sectional, pilot study of a mHealth application. Primary Objective This
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate mHealth adherence to a developmental application,
      Babysparks©, by parents of infants with complex congenital cardiac disease and single
      ventricle heart disease.

      Secondary Objective(s) -To determine the demographic and infant characteristics that
      correlate with mHealth adherence.

      -The rate of developmental progress of milestones while using the application will also be
      compared between infants with single ventricle cardiac disease and bi-ventricular cardiac
      disease.

      Research Intervention(s)/ Investigational Agent(s) Babysparks© developmental application is
      the main intervention with evaluation on feasibility of the mHealth application in a
      pediatric cardiology population.

      Study participants will be parents of infants with single ventricle and bi-ventricular
      complex congenital heart disease who underwent cardiac surgery in the first six weeks of life
      and are currently less than 18 months of age.

      Study Population There are approximately 150 new patients a year who have undergone cardiac
      surgery, with an additional 150 who are 18 months of age or less.

      Sample Size A maximum of 400 families/year Study Duration for Individual Participants Study
      participants will be monitored for a minimum of 6 months with the use of the BabySparks© App;
      to a maximum of 24 months of use of the app or when the child reaches a developmental age of
      24 months, whichever occurs first.

      Study design. A single site, cross-sectional, pilot study, with a pre/post-test design will
      be used to evaluate the mHealth adherence and the parental feedback after using this
      application. Additional feasibility measures of the application will be evaluated through the
      engagement and use of the application, use of the mHealth data back to the research team, and
      frequency of the parents implementing app-suggested activities, and the infants' ability to
      complete these developmental activities during use of the application.

      Theoretical Framework. Pediatric self-management theoretical framework follows infants to
      adolescents on a dynamic continuum with frequent modifiable and non-modifiable factors,
      processes, and behaviors that may affect adherence and outcomes. The factors may come from
      individual non-modifiable congenital heart disease, family factors, community support, and
      the health care system where the infant has their care. The interplay between parental stress
      and adherence to developmental interventions are highlighted in this theoretical framework,
      and allows for an underpinning framework for this study. Previous work with parental
      caregiving and motivation has included a theoretical model of the attachment-parenting theory
      which also supports this study to encourage interactive behaviors and developmental
      interventions.

      Research Procedures: The mHealth application will be downloaded by parents onto up to 5
      devices of their choosing with a primary email address as the linking account.

      The parents will be sent a REDCap survey prior to starting the use of the application to
      determine their current awareness and interventions being implemented with their child
      related to reaching developmental milestones, and a second survey will be sent to the family
      at the end of study period to get their feedback on the mHealth application.

      Data to be collected from the Electronic medical record (Stored in REDcap form), none of
      these are going to be stored in an identifiable manner: Cardiac diagnosis, Prenatal
      diagnosis, Cardiac surgery, Major genetic diagnosis, Major non-cardiac diagnosis, Age in days
      of cardiac surgery, Length of neonatal hospitalization (Days), Used the app prior to
      discharge, Age in days when parent started using the application, Total number of days in the
      hospital the first year of life, Total number of ICU days in the first year of life, Primary
      parent age, Primary parent gender, Primary parent education level, Number of other siblings,
      Route of feeds at discharge, Distance from the hospital at home

    <description>mHealth application, BabySparks©, will be implemented for infant and toddler developmental activities through 24 months of age. (Currently, BabySparks is only designed to work on the developmental milestones through 24 months of age, and therefore the use of the application will no longer be applicable to the patient after reaching a developmental age of 24 months. If the subject has not reached a developmental age of 24 months at the time he/she is chronologically 24 months, the subject/family will be able to continue to utilize the application for a maximum of 24 months from the time they began to use the application or until reaching a study endpoint of reaching 24 months developmentally or death, whichever the infant reaches first.)</description>

        Infants with single ventricle cardiac disease are also known to have more complex
        hospitalizations and need for gastrostomy feeding tubes as compared to infants with
        bi-ventricular cardiac disease. The need for gastrostomy feeding is associated with a
        higher risk of cognitive, language, and motor delays in toddler age children with cardiac
        disease with Post-acute care interventions for physical and occupational therapy like
        &quot;tummy time&quot; are recommended for infants, but there is a lack of specific guidelines or
        recommendations in pediatric cardiac programs related to the use of mHealth interventions
        performed by parents after their discharge to home.
