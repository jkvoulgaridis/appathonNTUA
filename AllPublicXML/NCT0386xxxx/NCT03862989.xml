  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the UK, approximately 150,000 people have a heart attack when the blood supply
      to their heart is compromised. As a result, affected regions of the heart can become diseased
      and scarred. In a healthy person, electrical waves propagate across the heart in a regulated
      pattern which triggers contraction to pump blood around the body. The scar tissue that forms
      as a result of a heart attack can disrupt the propagation of the electrical waves. If
      significant disruptions occur, blood cannot be pumped out of the body effectively, leading to
      sudden death.

      Ablation therapy aims to eliminate areas of diseased tissue that cause disruption to the
      heart rhythm, by applying radiofrequency using catheters inserted into the heart. The most
      accurate techniques used to locate the region to ablate require the induction of dangerous
      heart rhythms, which are only inducible in about 65% of people.

      Pace mapping is a technique used to locate regions to ablate, which can be performed during
      normal heart rhythm. ECG data, which records electrical signals from the heart, is collected
      when the patient has an abnormal heart rhythm. From this template ECG, a clinician can tell
      the approximate location of the diseased tissue. A catheter is directed to that location, the
      heart stimulated, and another ECG, called the paced ECG is recorded. If the paced ECG matches
      the template ECG, it is assumed that the heart was paced in the location that requires
      ablation.

      Current ablation techniques are difficult, time consuming, and inaccurate. As a result, the
      procedure may work in only half of all patients, and result in unnecessary damage to healthy
      tissue, leading to later impairment of heart function.

      The CPS project's overall goal is to increase the success rates of ablation therapy by
      improving the accuracy and efficiency of locating the optimal region of tissue to eliminate
      during the pace mapping procedure. Increasing ablation therapy success rates will mean that
      patients will be unlikely to suffer from future heart rhythm disorders as a result of their
      heart attack, increasing the life expectancy of heart attack patients. Excess damage caused
      to the heart as a result of unnecessary ablation lesions will be limited, decreasing the
      likelihood of future complications. In addition, dangerous heart rhythms do not need to be
      induced in the patient, significantly decreasing the risk of death during the treatment.

    <description>A catheter is inserted into the heart and signals are recorded from the heart whilst at rest or whilst being stimulated by a catheter, in order to determine the site to ablate. Radiofrequency is then delivered to the target site in order to disrupt the pathological electrical activation which is causing the abnormal heart rhythm.</description>
