      Sleep is essential for daytime functioning and health and important for both psychological
      and physiological wellbeing . A growing body of research indicates that chronic sleep
      disturbance is associated with impaired quality of life (QoL) and a risk factor for poorer
      health, for example depression cardiovascular disease, hypertension 1 and diabetes.

      insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a clinical condition defined as difficulties
      falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep and/or poor sleep quality despite adequate
      opportunity for sleep resulting in significant daytime impairment.

      The development of insomnia in healthy populations has a bi-directional relationship with
      psychological factors such as anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress, and may in clinical
      populations also be associated with physical symptoms, such as pain. the physical symptoms in
      psoriasis, such as itch, one would expect a higher prevalence of sleep disturbance in this
      patient group. On the other hand Sleep disturbance is common also in patients with atopic
      dermatitis (AD). Patients with AD often have sleep disturbances due to pruritus.

    <measure>sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)];</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.
A total score of &quot;5&quot; or greater is indicative of poor sleep quality. If you scored &quot;5&quot; or more it is suggested that you discuss your sleep habits with a healthcare provider</description>
