  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out whether wound closure (the process of closing the
      surgical wound after the procedure is complete) with Dermabond PRINEO Skin Closure System
      (PRINEO) will be faster and improve wound healing compared to standard closing methods after
      total shoulder replacement. The PRINEO system involves using running stitches to close the
      wound, and then taping over the sutures with a sticky film that holds the wound closed.
