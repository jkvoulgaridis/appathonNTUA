    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open-label, single-sequence, non-randomized, multiple-dose, crossover
      pharmacokinetic study is a single site study in the United States and will be conducted to
      assess the effect of a CYP1A2 inducer (omeprazole 40 mg once daily [QD]) on the
      pharmacokinetics of anagrelide (1 mg) when administered concurrently in healthy participants.
