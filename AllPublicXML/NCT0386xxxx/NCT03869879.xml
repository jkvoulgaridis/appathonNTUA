  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II of this study includes a pragmatic clinical trial which will take place at Northwest
      Rehabilitation Associates (NWRA) in Salem, OR to verify the efficacy of the system in a
      physical therapy clinic.

      This Phase II project is a collaboration among: 1) APDM, an innovative small business that
      has successfully commercialized several innovative products to quantify human movement; 2)
      the Balance Disorders Laboratory in the department of Neurology at Oregon Health &amp; Science
      University (OHSU); and 3) NorthWest Rehabilitation Associates (NWRA), a nationally-recognized
      outpatient rehabilitation center that will test the effectiveness of Mobility Rehab for
      adults with mobility disturbances.

      The objective of this Phase II application is to prepare the Mobility Rehab system for
      commercialization and demonstrate its efficacy for mobility training. Our hypothesis is that
      feedback-based rehabilitation will be more effective than standard rehabilitation for gait in
      older adults with gait disturbances. In this Phase II, we will use a pragmatic clinical trial
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Mobility Rehab on 300 patients with various types of gait
      disturbances in a physical therapy clinic. In addition to visual feedback, the system will be
      optimized in Phase II to also provide verbal feedback commands for patients during training.

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Directing physical therapist will assess eligibility, and randomize participants. Physical therapy aide will conduct baseline measures (questionnaires, ABC scale, and 2min walk). The four treating physical therapists are split into two groups: two therapists will provide traditional physical therapy, while the two other therapists will provide visual feedback-aided therapy for their participants. A second, blinded physical therapy aide will complete a follow-up assessment (ABC scale, 2min walk).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at a participant's baseline visit and final study visit, after an average of one month</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures an individual's perception of their own balance. Individuals use a scale ranging from 0% to 100% in rating the amount of confidence they have in their balance during 16 hypothetical daily-life activities. A score of 100% would represent one being fully confident in their balance during a specific task, while a score of 0% would represent one having no confidence at all in their balance. Total score ranges from 0 to 1600.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at a participant's baseline visit and final study visit, after an average of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed is measured through two instrumented, two-minute walks. The first walk is performed at the individual's casual walking pace and the second is performed at a pace the individual considers to be faster than their casual pace.</description>

    <description>During a visual feedback session, therapists will spend 30min per session using the Mobility Rehab system for gait training with patients. Therapists may select modality, overground walking and/or treadmill, tasks (dual task, head turns, etc. as above) as appropriate for each patient. They will additionally spend 15min on endurance, strength, and static and dynamic balance in functional tasks.</description>

    <description>During a regular session, patients with gait impairment will work on gait with the following tasks for 30min: weights on ankles, dual tasks, UE support, partial body weight support, speed challenges, obstacles, and head turning. Therapists may select modality, overground walking and/or treadmill, tasks (dual task, head turns, etc. as above) as appropriate for each patient. They will additionally spend 15min on endurance, strength, and static and dynamic balance in functional tasks.</description>
