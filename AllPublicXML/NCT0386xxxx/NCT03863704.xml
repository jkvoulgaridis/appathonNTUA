  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current available therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including
      immunomodulator and biologic medications may have toxicities limiting use or inadequate
      effect. We propose a novel approach to the treatment of IBD by using transcutaneous vagal
      nerve stimulation (VNS). Research has previously identified that VNS using a surgically
      implanted stimulator can improve symptoms and decrease inflammation in people with
      inflammatory diseases. This study will evaluate the use of non-invasive nerve stimulation
      through the skin (rather than through an implanted device) as a potential therapy in
      pediatric patients with Crohn Disease or ulcerative colitis. We will be evaluating how this
      nerve stimulation affects symptoms, markers of inflammation found in the blood and stool
      including cytokine levels, and heart rate variability. The primary hypothesis of the study is
      the use of transcutaneous VNS will decrease inflammation in people with IBD leading to
      improved signs and symptoms of disease. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the
      change in fecal calprotectin after 16 weeks of nerve stimulation. Secondary endpoints include
      changes in symptom scores, blood cytokine levels, and heart rate variability.

    <description>Blood will be collected into 2 tubes, one with no stimulant and the other with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate macrophages to produce cytokines. Cytokine levels within the blood will be assessed and compared to baseline levels. The cytokines being assayed include tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Interferon-gamma, Transforming Growth Factor-beta and Interleukins (IL) - 1, 6, 10, 12, 17, 18, 23. Samples will be collected for this analysis at week 0, 2, 4, and 24</description>
