  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis is a chronic rheumatic disease that requires prolonged radiographic
      follow-up. This repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation puts at risk the radiosensitive
      organs exposed in the field of irradiation. A new low-dose imaging system has emerged. This
      technique, called EOS, offers the advantage of lower irradiation associated with high images
      quality. Our goal through this work was to evaluate the reliability of the EOS imaging system
      compared to conventional radiography in the evaluation of the structural damage of SpA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the sacroiliac
      joints, the spine and / or the peripheral joints. It is characterized by a progressive and
      slow evolution over several years with a risk of ankylosis of the spine. It requires
      long-term follow-up of patients with repeated x-rays to assess structural damage. This
      repeated and cumulative exposure to radiation ionization puts at risk the radiosensitive
      organs that are in the field of irradiation.

      EOS is a new low dose X-ray system that significantly reduces X-ray doses compared to
      conventional radiography. This system allows the global assessment of the entire skeleton
      from head to toe, static spine and lower limbs with the obtaining of two-dimensional images
      of high quality with the possibility of a three-dimensional reconstruction. Although the
      benefits of the EOS system are promising with regard to radiation dose reduction, few studies
      have investigated its use in SpA and little evidence has supported its reliability in
      assessing the structural damage caused by the disease.
