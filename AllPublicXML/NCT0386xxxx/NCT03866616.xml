  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the parenting program on
      increasing positive parent-child interactions and increasing cognitive achievement in
      children. Overall, this project is intended to benefit women and children and supplement WIC
      services.

      The Brain Builders Parenting Class Evaluation Study Research Questions include the following:

        1. Does the program impact child development outcomes such as kindergarten readiness?

        2. Does the program increase parental knowledge about the importance of high-quality
           parent-child interaction for child development?

        3. Does the program impact the quality and quantity of the parent-child interactions?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Science demonstrates that the foundation of a person's ability to be innovative, creative,
      analytical and intellectual is established in the brain during the first few years of life.
      The brain controls every aspect of human life, from breathing to learning, behaving, adapting
      and thinking. Because the brain controls all aspects of human life, impaired brain function
      compromises physical, mental, and emotional health and overall productivity in society. The
      parent-child or caregiver-child relationship is one of the most important experiences for
      brain development and cognitive outcomes in young children. This relationship is vital for
      optimal brain development because of the dependency of neuronal connections on stimulating
      human interaction. Parental response to their child's verbal or nonverbal cues, frequently
      called &quot;serve and return&quot;, influences whether neural connections are strengthened or
      eliminated. An example of a positive serve and return scenario is a caregiver or parent's
      attentive response to a young child's cries through eye contact, acknowledging the child, and
      meeting the child's need. This type of positive interaction fosters neural connections that
      are important for communication and social skills.

      Many parents do not know or understand the impact their responses have on their child's brain
      development. While there are many parenting programs that teach parenting skills and
      behaviors, there were no evidences of any programs that were culturally and economically
      sensitive to vulnerable families and also educated parents on the brain science as well as
      equip parents with the skills to be responsive parents Brain Builders Parenting Class will
      work with both inner city and rural WIC clinics with representative populations of pregnant
      women and women with children under 1 years old, to provide parenting programs, led by WIC
      staff focused on brain development.

      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the parenting program in increasing positive
      parent-child interactions and increasing cognitive achievement in the children. The main goal
      of this evaluation study is to increase parents' self-efficacy by increasing their knowledge
      of brain development, improve their skills through observational learning and behavioral
      capability, provide reinforcement for positive interactions with baby and child, and increase
      their social support through the group parenting classes and shared experiences. The
      evaluation study will have two rounds. The first round will take place at recruitment in the
      WIC Centers. The second round will take place around the time that the child is between 22
      and 26 months old. This visit will take place at the WIC clinic.

    <measure>Child Development</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 22 to 26 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The child development will be assessed by using the Caregiver Reported Early Development Index (CREDI). The CREDI measures five dimension of child development: Motor development, Language development; Socioemotional development; Cognitive development; and Mental health. The CREDI was designed to serve as a population-level measure of early childhood development for children from birth to age three. As the name suggests, the CREDI exclusively relies on caregiver reports, and thus primarily focuses on milestones and behaviors that are easy for caregivers to understand, observe and describe.</description>

    <measure>Quality of the Language Environment: LENA System</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 22 to 26 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of the language environment at home will be measured by using the LENA System (LENA). LENA is an integrated processing and cloud-based software package that enables researchers to collect, manage, and analyze multiple recordings of children ages 2 months to 48 months.LENA device estimates adult words spoken to and around the key child, adult-child conversational interactions, child vocalizations, and language from TV and/or electronics</description>

    <measure>Measurement of the Child's Home Environment</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 22 to 26 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The StimQ instrument is a 39-point scale for measuring cognitive stimulation in the homes of children. It includes four sub scales: Availability of Learning Materials (ALM); Reading Scale; Parental Involvement in the Developmental Advance (PIDA); and Parental Verbal Responsivity (PVR). The ALM describes the type of learning materials available to a child. The Read Scale measures the number of books in the home and the amount of days spent reading to the child. The PIDA is scored by the number of 'Yes' responses to ten questions regarding parental involvement in child development. The PVR is scored by calculating the total number of 'Yes' responses to four questions regarding parental verbal responsibility. Higher values are associated with a better outcome since a higher value indicates the presence of more learning materials in the home. Subscales are combined by summing all the subscale scores to get the total StimQ score.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes (PICCOLO).</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 22 to 26 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the presence and absence of 29 developmentally supportive parenting behaviors across the entirety of a 10 minute, video recorded interaction. The PICCOLO scale is divided into four subcategories: affection, responsiveness, encouragement, and teaching. Each subcategory has approximately 7-8 parenting behaviors that a PICCOLO practitioner would observe. Each category's behaviors are scored on a scale from 0-2 where parents receive (0) if none of the behavior, (1) if some of the behavior, (2) if lots of the behavior. Higher values are associated with better outcomes since high values indicate a high amount of affection, responsiveness, encouragement, and teaching, which are behaviors linked to healthy cognitive development in children</description>

    <measure>Quality of the Child Sleep: The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 22 to 26 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) was developed on the basis of a review of the infant sleep literature in search of meaningful variables, particularly clinical studies based on the use of subjective and objective infant sleep measures. The questionnaire variables included 1) nocturnal sleep duration; 2) daytime sleep duration); 3) number of night wakings; 4) duration of wakefulness during the night hours; and 5) nocturnal sleep-onset. The criteria used to define poor sleepers on the basis of the BISQ measures are as follows: 1) the child wakes &gt; 3 times per night; 2) nocturnal wakefulness period is &gt; 1 hour; or 3) the total sleep time is &lt; 9 hours. Soothing techniques and the location of sleep are also evaluated and seem to play important roles in infant sleep. Infants who fall asleep alone in the crib and sleep in a crib in a separate room are more likely to sleep through the night, with fewer night wakings</description>

    <measure>Parent's beliefs</measure>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal depressive symptomatology measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)The score is the sum of the 20 questions. Each question has a total of four responses to choose from and each response is scored from 0-3 respectively.Possible range is 0-60. A score of 16 points or more is considered depressed. High values are considered a worse outcome since a score of 16 points or higher is indicative of depression.</description>
