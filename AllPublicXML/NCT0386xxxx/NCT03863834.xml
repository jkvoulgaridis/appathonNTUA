  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RFAL for the Breast
      Envelope and Nipple-Areolar Complex (NAC) Position as measured by Vectra 3D circumferential
      imaging system (Canfield, NJ)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast lift as observed by 3 plastic surgeons evaluating preoperative and postoperative photographs and measurements of distance (cm) between breast area reference points</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Regular and 3D Vectra photos will be taken at all time points.
Additional evaluation of changes in breast shape, including upper pole fullness, breast projection, and bottoming out will be assessed by static measurements (cm) of:
Sternal Notch to Nipple
Nipple to Inframammary Fold (IMF)
Base Width (at point of breast take off from chest wall)
Nipple to nipple</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of adverse events will be assessed based on frequency, severity and causality data.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by observation, assessment and recording of adverse events, if occur. Evaluations will be done immediately after treatment and at all follow-up visits. Each occurrence will be described in a table presenting data including severity (mild, moderate or severe), causality (relationship to the device or the treatment), treatment and resolution. Data will be summarized and adverse event significance will be considered based on combination of the above listed items.</description>

             study (i.e., oral contraceptives, IUD, contraceptive implant, barrier methods with
             spermicide, or abstinence).
