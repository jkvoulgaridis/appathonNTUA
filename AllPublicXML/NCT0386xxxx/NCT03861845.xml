    <textblock>
      This study uses an experimental design to test the impact of different types of pillboxes on
      medication adherence. Participants in this study will randomized to receive one of the three
      pillbox interventions: 1) A standard seven day a week, one-dose per day pillbox with training
      2) an off-the-shelf pillbox that was purchased specifically for the individual's needs with
      training and education, or 3) a customized 3D printed pillbox that was designed and
      manufactured specifically to the individual's needs with training and education. Participants
      will have three visits with the research team to collect baseline data, receive the pillbox,
      and collect follow up data.

      Risks to the study include loss of time, boredom, invasion of privacy, and medication errors.
      The investigators have taken precautions to mitigate these risks. This study will improve
      understanding of medication adherence and potentially help us better address poor medication
      adherence which needlessly causes morbidity, mortality, and costs over $300 million in
      unnecessary healthcare costs each year.

    <measure>Change in Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured by the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS). The ARMS is a 12-item assessment. Participants indicate the extent of their adherence on a 4-point Likert-like scale. Scores range from 12 - 48, with higher scores indicating worse medication adherence.</description>

    <measure>Change in satisfaction with pillbox</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0) will quantify participant's satisfaction with their pillbox on a five-point Likert-like scale. Scores range from 12-60, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Specifically, using the QUEST, the participants will evaluate their satisfaction with 8 features of the pillbox (dimensions, weight, ease in opening/closing the device, safety and security, durability, ease of use, comfort, and effectiveness) and four aspects of services used to attain the pillbox (service delivery, repairs and servicing, professional services, and follow-up services). Scores on the assistive device, services, and total score will be evaluated.</description>
