  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) affects up to 10% of very preterm infants. NEC mortality is
      high (30-50 %) and has remained unchanged over the last decades. New treatments are urgently
      needed. NEC pathogenesis is multifactorial, but bowel ischemia plays an essential role in NEC
      development. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) consists in inducing brief periods of
      non-lethal ischemia in a limb distant to an organ suffering from ischemia. RIC has been used
      in adults, children and term neonates with a variety of diagnosis. However, no study has been
      done including preterm infants with NEC.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An appropriately sized blood pressure cuff will be applied to an arm or leg and inflated to
      promote RIC. This study will be conducted in three phases to assess the feasibility and
      safety of RIC in relation to duration of ischemia time, number of cycles of RIC and whether
      it is feasible and safe to perform RIC on consecutive days.

    <measure>Limb perfusion after Remote Ischemic Conditioning</measure>
    <time_frame>1 days</time_frame>
    <description>Limb perfusion will be assessed before (baseline) and after Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC). Limb perfusion will be determined by oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry. RIC will be considered feasible and safe if the procedure is completed as planned with no failure of limb re-perfusion. Failure is defined as no return of limb arterial oxygen saturation to baseline 4 minutes after the ischemic phase (re-perfusion time).</description>

    <description>Pain measured according to the premature infant pain profile (PIPP) scores (range 0-21). Pain scores will be obtained immediately before (baseline) and 6 hours after RIC. Persistent pain will be defined as a PIPP score higher than the baseline score.</description>

    <description>An appropriately sized blood pressure cuff will be inflated around a limb (systolic blood pressure + 15 mmHg) for different periods of time (1 to up to 4 minutes), times (1 to up to 4 times) and consecutive days (1 to up to 2).</description>
