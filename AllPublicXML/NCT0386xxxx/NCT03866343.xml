    <textblock>
      Current efforts to arrest the epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have had limited
      success. Thus there is an urgent need for effective approaches to prevent the development of
      T2DM. It is widely accepted that the current epidemic is driven by an increase in global food
      abundance and reduced food quality, making changes in diet a key determinant of the T2DM
      epidemic. Dietary factors can affect cardio-metabolic health; among these factors, advanced
      glycation end-products (AGEs) in food are potential risk factors for insulin resistance and
      T2DM.

      AGEs are a heterogeneous group of unavoidable stable bioactive compounds. Endogenous
      formation of AGEs is a continuous naturally occurring process, and is the result of normal
      metabolism. However, increased formation of AGEs occurs during ageing and under
      hyperglycaemic conditions. AGEs are implicated in the development of diabetes and vascular
      complications.

      Over the past several decades, methods of food processing have changed and meals now contain
      excess fat and sugar and are most susceptible for the formation of AGEs. In addition, AGEs in
      food are highly desirable due to their profound effect on shelf life, sterility, flavour,
      colour, and thus food consumption. Hence, a substantial portion of AGEs are derived from
      exogenous sources, particularly food. These exogenous AGEs are potential risk factors for
      insulin resistance and the development of T2DM. The investigators recently found that dietary
      AGEs represent a significant source of circulating AGEs, and have similar pathogenic
      properties compared to their endogenous counterparts including the development of insulin
      resistance and T2DM. Taken together, dietary AGEs are proposed to play a pivotal role in the
      development and progression of T2DM and its complications. Reduction of dietary intake of
      AGEs may therefore be an alternative strategy to reduce the risk of vascular disease and
      insulin resistance. The investigators therefore hypothesize that dietary restriction of AGEs
      in overweight individuals improves insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, and vascular
      function.
