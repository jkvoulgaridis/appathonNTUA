  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the proportion, medication use and control rate of metabolic abnormalities
      such as dyslipidemia in outpatients with hypertension in different levels of hospitals in
      China. To investigate the gap between guidelines and clinical practices, and analyze the
      cause. we also set up a continuing medical education program to narrow the gap and the effect
      of the program will be estimated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatients from departments of Cardiology, Endocrinology, Nephrology, Neurology,
             Geriatrics or General Internal Medicine.

          2. Diagnosed as hypertension. Diagnostic criteria: 1)The office BP measured at the day of
             visit and at least one time before that day were above the cut-off values ( ≥140 mmHg
             SBP and/or ≥90 mmHg DBP); 2)for patients with normal BP at the day of visit, they
             should have already been given pre-treatment with antihypertensive drugs ≥ 2 weeks.

          3. Voluntary participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged&lt; 18 years old.

          2. Patients without a definite diagnosis of hypertension（for instance, if the patient has
             been taking antihypertensive drugs irregularly, it is difficult to confirm the
             diagnosis of hypertension）.

          3. Patients with a definite diagnosis of secondary hypertension.

          4. Patients are diagnosed dyslipidemia with clear cause, such as nephrotic syndrome,
             severe hypothyroidism, terminal stage of malignancy, etc.

          5. Patients are diagnosed end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis
             patients.

          6. Patients diagnosed with mental abnormalities who are unable to complete the
             questionnaire.

          7. Patients have once participated in this research during this study cycle（to avoid
             repeated participation）.
