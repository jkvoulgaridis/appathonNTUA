    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 13 (Day 85)</time_frame>
    <description>The Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (iRODS) is an instrument answered by the patient to assess overall disability. Patients are asked to rate their ability to perform everyday tasks (ie, able to perform without difficulties, able to perform but with difficulties, not able to perform). The iRODS consists of 24 items. The raw sum score ranges from 0 to 48 and will be translated to log odds units (logits), placing patients' estimates on the same logit scale. For easier interpretation the person locations can be translated to values changing from 0 (most severe activity and social participation restrictions) to 100 (no activity and social participation limitations).</description>

Investigators may request access to anonymized IPD and redacted study documents which may include: raw datasets, analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, blank case report form, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal.
