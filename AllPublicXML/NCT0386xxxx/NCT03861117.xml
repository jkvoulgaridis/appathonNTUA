  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess if a bundle associating pressure support and positive
      end-expiratory pressure during spontaneous breathing trial and detection by T-piece of
      patients with high-risk of extubation failure can reduce the time to successful extubation in
      critically ill patients.

    <description>Daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with 7 cmH2O pressure support and 5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure are performed to assess weanability. In case of success, a SBT with T-piece is performed to determine if the patients is at high risk of extubation failure. In this case and/or in the presence of risk factors, systematic non-invasive ventilation is applied after extubation.</description>
