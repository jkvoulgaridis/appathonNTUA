  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this interventional study is to objectively examine the prevalence of
      walking-related performance fatigability, together with the psychometric properties of its
      measuring parameters. The secondary aim is to investigate the relation of other clinical
      symptoms to walking-related performance fatigability.

      The following three research questions will be addressed:

        1. How prevalent is walking-related performance fatigability and what are the psychometric
           properties of fatigability formulas in preparation of use as experimental outcome
           measure?

        2. What are associated symptoms of walking-related motor fatigability and how long does
           this manifest?

        3. What is the relationship between cognitive fatigability and walking-related performance
           fatigability?

      participants perform two six-minute walking test (6MWT), with 3-5 days in between. Before and
      after the 6MWT, three screenings test (spasticity, muscle strength, balance) are executed and
      the participants have to indicate the severity of eleven possible symptoms (= symptom
      inventory, SI) on a VAS scale. These screening tests and SI are continued every 10 minutes
      for half an hour. During a third test session, participants perform a 6-minute vigilance
      alphabet test in rest and while doing a 6MWT to investigate the relationship between
      cognitive and motor fatigability.
