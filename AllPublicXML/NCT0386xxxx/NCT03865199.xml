  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abortion stigma is pervasive in the United States. It operates across multiple levels,
      including the individual, community, and structural. While abortion itself does not cause
      mental health problems, due to stigma, women who undergo abortion are at risk of suffering
      negative psychological responses including thought suppression and isolation, which can
      result in psychological distress. Few intervention studies have addressed abortion stigma.
      Research in other disciplines, in particular mental health, has demonstrated the importance
      of self-validation in improved coping. Drawing from psychologists' use of writing in
      cognitive therapy and the discipline of Narrative Medicine's emphasis on narrative as a
      mechanism of healing, the proposed study attempts to test a novel intervention to reduce
      individual level abortion stigma. The study will be a randomized controlled trial evaluating
      a narrative intervention to reduce individual level abortion stigma. The principal research
      question is: can a narrative intervention that aims to positively frame the abortion
      experience decrease individual level abortion stigma? An additional research question is:
      will women who take part in a narrative intervention to reduce abortion stigma have improved
      psychological responses to the abortion? Women in the intervention group will view a digital
      story on a tablet intending to provide education and normalization and then respond to a
      writing prompt aimed at cognitive restructuring. The control group will receive care as
      usual.

      The proposed study will be a two-arm, non-blinded, 1:1 randomized controlled trial of a
      narrative intervention to reduce individual level abortion stigma that will be conducted at
      Planned Parenthood of Illinois (PPIL). The narrative intervention combines exposing patients
      to a digital narrative and then asking them to respond to a writing prompt, aiming first to
      normalize the abortion experience and then to help frame it in positive terms. Women
      randomized to the intervention will view a story created by the research team on a tablet
      using headphones. The story will be read by an actor and digitally recorded for playback by
      the participant. The narrative will combine a fictional patient's abortion story with basic
      medical and social facts regarding abortion. After viewing the narrative, the participant
      will be asked to write a narrative either on a tablet provided or on paper with the prompt:
      &quot;Patients have different thoughts and feelings about their experiences when they have this
      procedure. Tell a story (about yourself or someone else, real or imaginary) that might help
      another patient feel supported.&quot; The goal behind this prompt is to allow the participant to
      write a narrative that is based in personal experience, but that provides the opportunity to
      mentally join a &quot;virtual community&quot; through the act of speaking to and helping another
      (theoretical) patient. Participants randomized to the intervention will complete the
      intervention during the visit, prior to meeting with an educator. Participants randomized to
      the control arm will receive regular care in the abortion clinic.

      Stigma will be measured at baseline and 2-4 weeks following the intervention with the
      Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS), a scale that was developed to measure the
      impact of abortion stigma interventions. Four items from The Profile of Mood States- Short
      Form (POMS-SF) will be used to assess psychological distress at the abortion visit and again
      at follow-up. Pre- and post-intervention test scores between groups will be compared in the
      final analysis.

    <intervention_model_description>Women aged 18 or older undergoing medical or surgical abortion at Planned Parenthood of Illinois will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Recruitment will occur two days a week, altering days of the week, and all patients seen on recruitment days not meeting exclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to enroll after their confirmatory ultrasound. This will be a non-blinded 1:1 randomized controlled trial. Randomization will be done using a computer-generated randomization sequence. A research assistant will place study group assignment in a sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelope. This envelope will be opened by the researcher obtaining consent, who will not be involved in clinical care.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Difference in score on the Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS) between baseline and follow-up: The ILAS is a validated 20-item scale that measures individual level stigma with four subscales including: worries about judgment, isolation, self-judgment, and community condemnation. The ILAS has a maximum score of five; in the study that established validity of this scale, the mean score was 1.35 with a standard deviation of 0.63. A higher score indicates greater stigma and a lower score indicates lesser stigma, so a greater decrease in mean scores between baseline and follow-up seen in the intervention group as compared to the control group would indicate an effect of the narrative intervention.</description>

    <description>Difference in score on a modified version of the Profile of Mood States- Short Form (POMS-SF) between baseline and follow-up: Given the length of the POMS-SF, only a few items will be tested. The shortened form is a 37-item questionnaire that asks subjects to rate various adjectives or mood states on a Likert Scale. In this study, the items used will be &quot;sad,&quot; &quot;discouraged,&quot; &quot;confident,&quot; and &quot;satisfied.&quot; The scale is scored by adding up the scores associated with negative responses and subtracting the scores associated with positive responses. The maximum score is 4, and the minimum score is zero. A lower score indicates a lower level of psychologic distress. While using only a few items of the POMS-SF has not been specifically validated, we believe that it will provide useful information to evaluate our secondary outcome of psychological distress without placing a significant time burden on participants.</description>
