  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ValveClamp (Hanyu Medical Technology, Shanghai, China) is the first edge-to-edge mitral
      valve repair system for interventional operation in China, which is composed of the front
      clamp, the rear clamp and the closed ring. The purpose of the multi-center trial is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ValveClamp for degenerative mirtal regurgistation.

      The transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair device MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Santa
      Clara, CA, USA) is the most mature device for mitral regurgitation. Another transcatheter
      edge-to-edge mitral valve repair device, the PASCAL system, has been shown to be feasible to
      reduce MR severity. Both the MitraClip and PASCAL devices need a complex steerable deliver
      system and thus complex process to steer the device to mitral valve. An easy-to-operate
      transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair system (ValveClamp) with larger coaptation
      width was thus recently developed in China. The ValveClamp (Hanyu Medical Technology,
      Shanghai, China) is the first edge-to-edge mitral valve repair system for interventional
      operation in China, which is composed of the front clamp, the rear clamp and the closed ring.
      The purpose of the multi-center trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      ValveClamp for degenerative mirtal regurgistation.

    <description>The NYHA cardiac function class containing the levels of Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, relies on the concept of ordinary physical activities. Class Ⅰ means that patients have cardiac disease but without the resulting limitations of physical activity. Class Ⅱ means that patients have cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Class Ⅲ refers to that patients have cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Class Ⅳ refers to that patients have cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort.</description>
