    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well a fecal microbiota transplant with or without total gut
      decontamination works in preventing graft versus host disease in patients exposed to
      broad-spectrum antibiotics. Fecal microbiota transplantation is the administration by enema
      of fecal matter (stool) that includes helpful bacteria from a normal, healthy donor. Total
      gut decontamination uses antibiotics to remove/reduce the amount of bacteria in the digestive
      system. It is not yet known if a fecal microbiota transplant with or without total gut
      decontamination works better in preventing graft versus host disease compared to standard
      immunosuppressive therapies (therapies that lower the normal function of the immune system).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who develop acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by day 100 post-transplant for patients randomized to the
      standard of care, total gut decontamination (TGD) followed by fecal microbiota transplant
      (fecal microbiota transplantation [FMT]) and FMT alone arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall maximum stage of lower GI tract GVHD by day 100 post-transplant. II. Cumulative
      incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and maximum grade through 6 months.

      III. Time to onset of acute GVHD and acute GI GVHD. IV. Incidence of adverse events and
      serious adverse events. V. Incidence of bacterial blood stream infections through 6 months.
      VI. Hematologic recovery (neutrophils and platelets). VII. Characterization of the intestinal
      microbiota at enrollment, pre-FMT / time of engraftment, 2 month post-FMT/ engraftment, onset
      of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) GVHD, and at study completion (6 months).

      VIII. Relapse-free survival at 6 months post-randomization. IX. Non-relapse mortality at 6
      months post-randomization. X. Overall survival (OS) at 6 months post-randomization.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A (TGD + FMT): Patients receive piperacillin-tazobactam orally (PO) three times daily
      (TID) and nystatin PO four times daily (QID) until FMT. Patients undergo stem cell
      transplantation on day 0, then undergo FMT via enema over 5-10 minutes within 3 weeks after
      transplantation.

      ARM B (FMT): Patients undergo stem cell transplantation on day 0, then undergo FMT via enema
      over 5-10 minutes within 3 weeks after transplantation.

      ARM C (STANDARD THERAPY): Patients receive standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days and 6 months.
