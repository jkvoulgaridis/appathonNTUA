  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify whether partial blockade of human dopamine signaling with
      antipsychotic drugs affects human stress responses, motivation and emotion. 84 healthy adult
      participants are planned to complete the study protocol.

      Therefore three experiments are planned:

      Experiment 1: Influence of amisulpride on human stress responses. Experiment 2: Influence of
      amisulpride on motivated effort. Experiment 3: Influence of amisulpride on emotion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial with two groups. One group
      will be receiving placebo (PG) and the other group will receive 300 mg amisulpride (VG). All
      participants are planned to complete all three experiments sequentially after drug/placebo
      intake.

      In experiment 1 we want to test whether a medium single dosage of amisulpride (VG) changes
      human stress responses compared to the PG. Therefore test subjects take the medication /
      placebo and wait for peak plasma levels. Afterwards they undergo a standardized stress test
      (MAST procedure,e.g. Shilton et al., 2017) where they submerge their non-dominant hand in
      cold water and have to do mental arithmetic tasks. We collect ECG, cortisol and skin
      conductance data as well as subjective measures of the stress response.

      In experiment 2 that is done after completion of experiment 1 the aim is testing whether the
      VG compared to the PG has an altered motivated effort. Therefore so called effort based
      paradigms (Reddy et al., 2015) are used. In these paradigms participants are given the option
      between an easy and effortless way of solving a trial that is reinforced with a small
      monetary reward or a harder and effortful way of trial solving that is rewarded higher. We
      measure how often the VG versus the PG will take the easy, low reward option over the hard,
      high reward option.

      In experiment 3 and after the completion of experiment to the aim is it to test whether the
      mean intensity of visually evoked emotions in the VG is changed compared to the PG. Therefore
      we use a stimulus set (15 positive images, 15 negative images, 15 neutral images) out of the
      International Affective Picture System images to evoke emotions and plan to analyze data like
      in positivity offset research (detailed description in: Strauss et al, 2017).

    <measure>Change in Perceived stress level from baseline to post stress period.</measure>
    <time_frame>After preparation period. Before (76 min before, 22 min before, 5min before) and after the stress test (directly after, 16 min as well as 30 min after completion).</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after the stress test of experiment 1 we ask every participant for their perceived stress level. These data serve as an indicator of subjective stress responses. We analyze changes in subjective stress level compared to baseline measurements (76 min and 22 min before). Five minutes before the stress test starts we measure subjective anticipatory stress response and directly after the completion we measure post stressor responses and possible residual feelings of stress (16 minutes post completion).
All measurements reflect a single time series. Stress levels are obtained with visual analogue scales ranging from 0 (no stress) to 100 points (extremely stressed).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of difficult trials in the balloon effort task.</measure>
    <time_frame>After the cortisol response of experiment 1 is subsided and directly when experiment is 2 is completely finished. This will be approximately 121 minutes after medication / placebo intake.</time_frame>
    <description>In experiment 2 which is a computer task, participants can choose between an easy task with low monetary reinforcement or a hard task with higher monetary reinforcement. &quot;Easy&quot; means that there is a low amount of physical or cognitive effort per trial and &quot;hard&quot; means that there is a higher amount of physical or cognitive effort per trial. From the tasks that are described in Reddy et al (2015) the balloon effort task (physical effort) and the deck choice task (mental effort) will be used. For both tasks our software automatically obtains the percentage of difficult trials with respect to the total number of trials. Note that only a single composite score is obtained after finishing the balloon effort task.</description>

    <measure>Mean positive affect ratings in response to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images.</measure>
    <time_frame>After experiment 3 is finished. This will be approximately 216 minutes after medication / placebo intake.</time_frame>
    <description>Valence and arousal measures are collected as in Strauss et al. (2017) after presentation of IAPS pictures during experiment 3. Ratings for positive affect, negative affect and arousal ratings are obtained with a 10 point self-assessment manikin scale after the presentation of each individual picture. Note that only a single composite score for positive affect is calculated as the mean value of all evaluations following the individual pictures.</description>

    <measure>Saliva cortisol levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>After preparation period. Before (62 min before, 2 min before) and after the stress test (5, 15 and 25 min after completion).</time_frame>
    <description>Before and at three time points after the stress test is completed of experiment 1 we take saliva cortisol samples of each participant. These samples are analysed for cortisol levels and serve as an indicator of Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity.
Cortisol levels are measured in nmol/liter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate changes and changes in heart rate variability.</measure>
    <time_frame>After preparation period. Before (68 min before, 49 min before), during (the whole procedure) and after (directly after completion) the stress test.</time_frame>
    <description>Before, during and after the stress test of experiment 1 we use blood volume pulse measures for obtaining heart rate data and calculate heart rate change scores and heart rate variability scores (HRV). These data serve as an indicator of cardiovascular stress responses.
Heart rate changes are measured in Δ1/s. Changes in heart rate variability is normalized for heart rate change because higher HR during stress exposure could induce a mathematical bias. Data that will be obtained include the low frequency band and the high frequency / low frequency ratio. A short introduction into the topic can be found in Billmann et al (2015).</description>
