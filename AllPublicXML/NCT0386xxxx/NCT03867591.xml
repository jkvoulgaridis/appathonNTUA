    <textblock>
      Heartburn is as common gastrointestinal symptom experienced by otherwise healthy adults and
      typically manifests as a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or in the chest.
      Typically, heartburn symptoms are treated with over-the-counter (OTC) medications which may
      come with side effects.

      There is suggestive evidence of the efficacy of fermented soy (Gastro-AD®) for the heartburn
      symptom relief. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a fermented soy on
      heartburn symptom relief and time to onset.

      Heartburn is as common gastrointestinal symptom experienced by otherwise healthy adults and
      typically manifests as a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or in the chest.
      Usually it is caused by the regurgitation of gastric acid into the esophagus. The prevalence
      of heartburn is 10-20% worldwide and is increasing. Typically, heartburn symptoms are treated
      with over-the-counter (OTC) medications which may come with side effects.

      Gastro-AD® is a commercially available food supplement produced by fermentation of soy by a
      specific strain of Lactobacillus. There is suggestive evidence, in vivo as well as in vitro
      studies, of the efficacy of fermented soy (Gastro-AD®) for the heartburn symptom relief. The
      aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a fermented soy on heartburn symptom relief and
      time to onset. It is hypothesized that the consumption of 1-3 g of fermented soy will relieve
      the heartburn symptom severity.

    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study; the sponsor representative involved in the study, the investigator, the participants or site personnel involved in participant management or outcome assessment will remain blinded. Blinding to intervention will be used to reduce bias during data collection and evaluation of outcomes. At the investigational site, the randomization codes will remain secure at all times, but may be accessed in the event of an emergency.</masking_description>
