  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of non instrumental pleural chest
      physiotherapy on the recovery of respiratory function, at hospital discharge or 15 days after
      beginning the pleural chest physiotherapy, compared to physiotherapy with standard
      mobilization, in patients with infectious pleural effusion, who have received usual medical
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pleural effusions are defined by an abnormal amount of fluid in the pleural space. Those
      complicating a pneumonia are commonly encountered in pneumology departments, and their number
      are increasing. If not quickly treated, complications often occur: pleural adhesions, pleural
      thickening which can lead to a restrictive lung disease, or even to surgery. The average
      length of stay in hospital of this patients is 15 days. The management of infectious pleural
      effusion consists of removing the fluid from the pleural space (pleural puncturing or
      drainage), with or without fibrinolytics, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy. Chest
      physiotherapy is often prescribed, but its benefits are largely based on empirical evidence.
      In the absence of recommendations, chest physiotherapy is done in heterogeneous ways, in
      France and abroad.

      Pleural chest physiotherapy combines postural respiratory exercises, increased ventilation
      with dynamics expirations, and early inspiratory exercises, resulting in mobilization of
      pleura and pleural fluid. The hypothesis is that pleural chest physiotherapy thus makes it
      possible to fight against pleural effusion stagnation, to help resorption of pleural fluid,
      to limit formation of pleural adhesions and fixed restrictive lung disease. This should
      improve the recovery of respiratory function, and allow a shorter hospital stay, an
      improvement of the quality of life, earlier resumption of activities, and a reduction in the
      risk of complications.
