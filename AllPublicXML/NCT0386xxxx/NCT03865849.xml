  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative process that affects joint cartilage and
      the subchondral bone. Approximately 10% to 30% of all osteoarthritis patients suffer from
      disabling symptoms such as pain, stiffness and loss of function leading to psychological and
      sleeping disorders and a diminished quality of life. When conservative treatment fails to
      treat the symptoms, a total knee arthroplasty can be performed. However, this procedure is
      not suitable for all patients. For these specific groups of patients a radiofrequent
      treatment of the genicular nerves might be an alternative treatment option. Multiple
      researchers investigated the effect of conventional and later also, cooled radiofrequent
      treatment of the genicular nerves, with promising results for both techniques. However, the
      techniques have never been compared in a randomised controlled trial. This study is designed
      to assess the feasibility of conducting a large RCT comparing pain relief and costs after a
      conventional radiofrequency treatment of the genicular nerves (superomedial, superolateral
      and inferomedial) versus a cooled radiofrequency treatment.

      This pilot study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, double blind, randomised
      controlled non-inferiority trial. The total follow up time is 6 months with follow up
      assessments at 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention. It is estimated that the total duration
      of data collection will cover 1 year. Adult patients (&gt; 18 years) with chronic, moderate to
      severe knee pain (NRS&gt;4) due to osteoarthritis, radiological diagnosed to be graded 2-4
      according to the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria or with persistent postoperative moderate to
      severe knee pain (NRS&gt;4) after total knee arthroplasty can be included in the study.

      Patients will be randomly selected for treatment with conventional radiofrequent treatment or
      cooled radiofrequent treatment of the SL, SM and IL genicular nerves. In total, three
      hospitals participate in this study: Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (Belgium), Maastricht UMC+
      (Netherlands) and Rijnstate (Netherlands).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>at one, three and six months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is a unidimensional, subjective measurement of pain intensity, expressed by the patient as a number between 0 and 10. It is a 11 point scale in which 0 equals no pain and 10 maximal pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient self-reported impression of change</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patient self-reported impression of change, measured by the Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The impression of change is measured using a 7 point likert scale ranging from &quot;very much worse (7)&quot; to &quot;very much improved (1).&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in medication use,</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The change in medication use, measured by the change in Medication Quantification Scale III (MQS III). The MQS is designed as a methodology of quantifying different drug regimens in 1992 and updated in 1998 (MQS II) and 2003 (MQS III) using detriment weights determined by surveying physician members of the American Pain Society</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The duration of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the time interval in which a NRS reduction of more than 50% is obtained or in which the pain is still acceptable without the usage of other additional therapies (increase in MQS 3 score of more than 50%, intra-articular infiltration, operation)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3 and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by the change in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The OKS is a patient-reported measure assessing pain intensity and physical function. The list consists of 12 items scored from 1 to 5, with 0 representing normal function/ least symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>This measured by the change in EQ-5D-5L,intervention.The EQ-5D-5L is a patient-reported generic measure of HRQoL comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Responses to the 5 items (one for each dimension) result in a patient's health state that can be transformed into a utility score ranging between 0 (death) and 1 (full health), representing the quality of life of the health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is developed to detect anxiety and depression in patients with physical health problems. The questionnaire consists of 14 items: 7 items to measure anxiety and 7 items to measure depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 months post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is often used in clinical settings to measure catastrophic thinking related to pain. The 13 item questionnaire consists of 3 subscales (magnification, rumination and helplessness) and asks patients to reflect on past painful experiences and to indicate the degree on which they experiences each of 13 thoughts of feelings on a 5- point scale (0 not at all and 4 all the time).</description>
