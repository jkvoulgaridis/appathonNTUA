  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of ultrafiltration (UF) and fluid status in peritoneal dialysis has been
      increasingly aware of over the last two decades. There is growing body of observational
      evidence showing that low UF is related to unfavorable outcome especially in anuric patients.
      The other side of the problem of UF is excessive fluid removal could volume deplete patients
      and result in loss of residual renal function and overexposing the membrane to glucose
      unnecessarily. UF is a double-edged sword. The correct measure of UF is the bottom line of
      talking about target.

      Measuring UF is supposed to be simple and straight forward. The most common way of measuring
      UF in clinical practice was to weight the effluent bag and minus the manufacture announced
      fill volume.

      Until about 10 years ago, the society first aware that the measurement error in such way is
      not acceptable. Overfil (the actual volume of dialysate fill in the bag is more than
      announced) problem was raised from then.

      However, there are several other problems around this issue. Firstly, when the product has
      just been produced overfill is different between manufactory.

      Secondly, the overfill volume does change over transportation and storage. But it is not
      clear how big the change is.

      Thirdly, most of the clinics weight the dialysate effluent rather than measure the volume in
      CAPD, although the specific gravity of dialysate is clearly not going to be 1g/ml.

      Taking the fact measuring weight is much easier than measuring volume in CAPD, the question
      behind is to understand how big the difference is and consequently whether it is acceptable.

      All the patients enrolled in the study would be asked to collect all dialysate effluent of
      the day of their routine peritoneal dialysis adequacy study and bring to the hospital. The
      exact weight of the bag for PET test (2.5% glucose concentration and dwell time of 4 hour)
      before and after the dwell and volume measured of the effluent. The dialysate electrolyte,
      glucose, protein and creatinine level would also be measured.
