      This is a single site, early feasibility study to support development of a novel therapeutic
      approach for utilizing the NeuroPace RNS® System for nucleus accumbens responsive
      neurostimulation (NAc- RNS) to ameliorate loss of control over (LOC) eating in persons with
      treatment-refractory obesity, specifically those who have failed gastric bypass surgery. The
      primary objectives are to assess the safety &amp; feasibility &amp; potential efficacy of the medical
      device named the NeuroPace RNS® System

    <description>The RNS® System is a novel, implantable therapeutic device that delivers responsive neurostimulation, an advanced technology designed to continuously monitor brain electrical activity, detect abnormal electrical activity and respond by delivering imperceptible levels of electrical stimulation to normalize that activity before an individual experiences seizures. This is an Early Feasibility Study determining the safety and efficacy of NAc-RNS in the treatment of LOC eating in treatment-refractory obesity.</description>
