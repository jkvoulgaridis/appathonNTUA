    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of the home-based therapeutic parenting intervention
      BRIGHT with pregnant women and postpartum mothers with opioid use disorders (OUDs) and their
      infants. It examines whether participation in the BRIGHT intervention improves parent-child
      relationships, parenting capacities, the mother's overall mental health, participation in OUD
      treatment, infant social-emotional development and decreases the likelihood of child
      maltreatment. Approximately half of the participants will receive the BRIGHT intervention,
      monthly handouts, and the standard of care at the maternal-fetal medical clinic and the other
      half will receive STAR, or Enhanced Treatment as Usual (TAU+), which includes monthly
      handouts and the standard of care from the medical clinic.

    <textblock>
      Growing Together is a two-armed pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a trauma and
      evidence-informed therapeutic parenting intervention, BRIGHT. This trial lasts approximately
      9 months.

      BRIGHT has been offered to young children ages birth through 6 years and their parents
      affected by substance use disorders (SUDs) to mitigate the effects of trauma, promote
      resilience, and enhance the quality of parent-child relationships and parenting skills.
      BRIGHT has been successfully piloted and evaluated within residential treatment and
      outpatient opioid treatment programs for pregnant women/mothers with SUDs and OUDs with young
      children .

      For this study, BRIGHT has been adapted for home-based delivery for pregnant women receiving
      treatment for OUDs and is offered from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy until the infant is
      about 6 months old. Participants in both arms will be recruited from a high-risk
      maternal-fetal medicine clinic and followed for approximately 15 months. The two arms of the
      trial are 1) the BRIGHT (Building Resilience through Intervention, Growing Healthier
      Together) intervention, and 2) STAR. Both arms of the study will receive the typical standard
      of care of at a high-risk maternal-fetal medical clinic and 7 monthly psycho-educational
      handouts on child development specifically for mothers in recovery.

      The investigators are testing the effectiveness of the adapted version of BRIGHT by utilizing
      measures to examine if participation in BRIGHT decreases the likelihood of child
      maltreatment, improves parent-child relationships, parenting capacities, the mother's overall
      mental health, participation in OUD treatment, and infant social-emotional development.

    <measure>Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB) system (Observer-rated parent-infant video), measuring Maternal Sensitivity (representing the parent-child relationship)</measure>
    <time_frame>t1 (6-8 Weeks postpartum), t2 (6-8 months postpartum)</time_frame>
    <description>CIB is a rating of mother-child interactions which has three 5-point Likert subscales: Maternal Sensitivity (MSense, primary outcome), Maternal intrusiveness (MIntrude), and Child involvement. (CInvolve). High scores on CIB scales indicate more evidence of the behavior/dimension. Moderate scores typically indicate presence of the behavior/dimension approximately 50% of the time. Low scores indicate that the behavior/dimension is never/infrequently observed. The CIB has been validated with healthy and at-risk populations. The study is assessing the change in CIB score between the time points.</description>

    <measure>The Adult- Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2 (AAPI), measuring the Risk of Child Maltreatment</measure>
    <time_frame>t1 (6-8 weeks postpartum), t2 (6-8 months postpartum), t3 (9-11 months postpartum)</time_frame>
    <description>Responses to the inventory provide an index of risk for practicing behaviors known to be attributable to child abuse and neglect. Answers are recorded on a scale from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. Subscales include: Construct A - Inappropriate Expectations of Children, Construct B - Parental Lack of Empathy Towards Children's Needs, Construct C - Strong Parental Belief in the Use of Corporal Punishment, Construct D - Reversing Parent-Child Family Roles, Construct E - Oppressing Children's Power and Independence. 32-item inventory assessing parenting and child-rearing attitudes associated with risk for child maltreatment. Five parenting interaction constructs include, 1) inappropriate expectations for child, 2) empathic awareness of child's needs, 3) belief in corporal punishment, 4) role reversal and 5) oppressing children's power. Construct validity is well-established. Test-re-test reliability is .76. The study is assessing the change in AAPI score between the time points.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress Index/Short Form (PSI/SF), measuring Parenting Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>t1 (6-8 weeks postpartum), t2 (6-8 months postpartum), t3 (9-11 months postpartum)</time_frame>
    <description>36-item self-report measure of parenting stress in 3 domains: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and parent's perceptions of child's difficulty. A high total stress score (above 90) indicates a greater level of parenting stress. The PSI/SF has excellent external validity, and test-re-test reliability is .76. Screening and triage measure for evaluating the parenting system and identifying issues that may lead to problems in the child's or parent's behavior. Focuses on three major domains of stress: child characteristics, parent characteristics and situational/demographic life stress. 1-5 Likert scale. 3 subscales: Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child. Child and Parent domains combine to form Total Stress Scale.</description>
