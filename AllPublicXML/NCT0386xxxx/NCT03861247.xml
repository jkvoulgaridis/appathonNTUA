  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial without
      blinding. A total of 116 participants with hyperphosphatemia will be enrolled from three
      hemodialysis center (56 from Huashan Hospital, 30 from Huadong Hospital and 30 from Tongji
      Hospital). All participants will be randomly divided into control group and intervention
      group in a ratio of 1:1. Phosphorus balance status is evaluated in participants of the
      intervention group by the phosphorus balance calculator. Then, these participants will be
      given individualized phosphate-binders, dietary and dialysis intervention according to the
      results of phosphorus balance evaluation. Participants in the control group will not receive
      the phosphorus balance status evaluation but receive phosphate-binder treatment according to
      the KDIGO Guidelines. Dietary phosphorus intake, dialysate calcium concentration and dose of
      active vitamin D, phosphorus-binders of all participants will be recorded during the whole
      research program. After two-week treatment, the phosphorus balance of participants in
      intervention group will be evaluated again and the therapeutic strategies then will be
      adjusted. At the same time, the therapeutic strategies of participants in the control group
      will be adjusted according to the serum phosphorus concentration. All participants will be
      followed up for two weeks again and receive blood test and related examinations at the end of
      study. The results of final examinations will be analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of
      individualized treatment of hyperphosphatemia.
