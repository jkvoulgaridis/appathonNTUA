  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle insulin resistance is a hallmark of upper body obesity (UBO) and Type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM). It is unknown whether muscle free fatty acid (FFA) availability or intramyocellular
      fatty acid trafficking is responsible for the abnormal response to insulin. Likewise, the
      investigators do not understand to what extent the incorporation of FFA into ceramides or
      diacylglycerols (DG) affect insulin signaling and muscle glucose uptake. The investigators
      will measure muscle FFA storage into intramyocellular triglyceride, intramyocellular fatty
      acid trafficking, activation of the insulin signaling pathway and glucose disposal rates
      under both saline control (high overnight FFA) and after an overnight infusion of intravenous
      niacin (lower/normal FFA) to provide the first integrated examination of the interaction
      between FFA and muscle insulin action from the whole body to the cellular/molecular level. By
      identifying which steps in the insulin signaling pathway are most affected, the investigators
      will determine the site-specific effect of ceramides and/or DG on different degrees of
      insulin resistance.

      Hypothesis 1: Greater trafficking of plasma FFA into intramyocellular DG will impair proximal
      insulin signaling and reduce muscle glucose uptake.

      Hypothesis 2: Lowering FFA in UBO and T2DM by using an intravenous infusion of niacin will
      alter trafficking of plasma FFA into intramyocellular ceramides in a way that will improve
      insulin signaling and increase muscle glucose uptake.

      Hypothesis 3: Lowering FFA in UBO and T2DM by using an intravenous infusion of niacin will
      alter trafficking of plasma FFA into intramyocellular DG in a way that will improve insulin
      signaling and increase muscle glucose uptake.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized, saline control trial of the effects of niacin on intracellular fatty acid trafficking in insulin resistant states. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for up to the next 8 weeks.
A final evaluation and collection of lab samples will be conducted at the end of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Difference in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal between overnight saline control study and overnight/insulin clamp niacin infusion study.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose disposal rates will be measured in upper body obese and type 2 diabetic volunteers using hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp under saline control conditions and during an intravenous infusion of niacin. Blood, muscle and fat samples will be collected on both study days, the first after an intravenous infusion of C13-labelled palmitate to measure enrichment in plasma palmitate and intramyocellular ceramides, diacylglycerols, long-chain acylcarnitines, and triglycerides under fasting conditions. The second biopsies will be at the end of the insulin clamp during which the volunteers will receive an intravenous infusion of D-9 palmitate to all enrichment measures during the insulin clamp. Measures of the insulin signaling (and other) pathway(s) will be made on both muscle and adipose biopsy samples collected on both study days. Adipose samples will be processed to measure morphology and function of adipocytes.</description>
