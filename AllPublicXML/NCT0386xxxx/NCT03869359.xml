  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often link their symptoms to foods. Interest in
      dietary management recently increased, including the use of a gluten-free diet.

      To investigate relation of gluten-free diet (GFD) and IBS, a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled cross-over trial will be carried out in adults (&gt;18) and patients with IBS
      according to Rome IV criteria. The aim is to assess gluten-free versus gluten-containing diet
      in IBS patients and Healthy Volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.

      The aim is to assess the effects of gluten-free diet (GFD) compared to gluten-containing diet
      (GCD) in IBS patients and Healthy Volunteers on gastrointestinal symptoms, visceral
      sensitivity, bacterial fermentation, psychological factors and quality of life. The primary
      hypothesis is that GFD decreases gastrointestinal symptoms compared to GCD and that this
      change is accompanied with reduced visceral sensitivity and change in bacterial fermentation.
      The secondary hypothesis is that GFD positively influences psychological factors and quality
      of life.

      IBS patients (Rome IV) and Healthy Volunteers are challenged with gluten in this randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. They start with GFD or GCD and cross over
      to the other intervention (both for 14 days). In between there is a wash-out period of at
      least 14 days. The subjects will get gluten-free meals (lunch and dinner) and have to
      sprinkle powder over the meals, concealed in sachets with either gluten (vital gluten) or
      placebo (rice starch). The subjects will follow a strict GFD during the GFD and GCD periods.
      The subjects will eat and drink as before the study during the washout period.

      Primary outcomes are change in gastrointestinal symptoms, assessed by questionnaires,
      including IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and Gastrointestinal Symtom Rating Scale-IBS
      (GSRS-IBS). A 50-point reduction in IBS-SSS indicates clinical response. Bacterial
      fermentation (exhaled hydrogen and methane) and visceral sensitivity will be measured using
      the Lactulose-Nutrient Challenge Test. Secondary outcomes are change in psychological factors
      and quality of life assessed by questionnaires, including CSI, HADS, HSPS, IBSQOL, PHQ-15 and
      VSI.

    <measure>Change in Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(day 0), day 14, day 28, day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) is a validated questionnaire that incorporates typical IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain, abdominal distension and bowel dysfunction, as well as quality of life. Subjects rated their symptoms on a visual analogue scale. The maximum achievable score is 500 points (sum of the 5 scales). A reduction in the total IBS-SSS score of at least 50 points is considered to indicate a clinically significant improvement in symptoms. The scale can also be used to classify IBS symptoms severity: &lt;75 points (no symptoms), 75-175 points (mild symptoms), 175-300 points (moderate symptoms) and &gt;300 points (severe symptoms). Measured after both dietary periods and at baseline of both periods.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(day 0), day 14, day 28, day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS) measures symptom severity and symptom frequency in IBS patients and is a reliable and validated questionnaire. Thirteen questions are evaluated and rated from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort) on a Likert scale. The total scores can range from 13 to 91 (sum of the domains). The GSRS-IBS evaluates 5 domains: abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea and satiety. Measured after both dietary periods and at baseline of both periods.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline(day 0), day 14, day 28, day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) contains 7 items for depression and 7 for anxiety. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, and therefore the total score per subscale can range from 0 to 21. When subjects score &gt;10 on 1 or 2 of the subscales, clinically significant psychological distress (anxiety or depression) is likely present. Measured after both dietary periods and at baseline of both periods.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline(day 0), day 14, day 28, day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS) contains 27 items and is a valid and reliable questionnaire that measures sensory-processing sensitivity in individuals. Each item is scored from 1 to 7, and therefore the total score can range from 27 to 189. Higher scores indicate high sensory-processing sensitivity. Measured after both dietary periods and at baseline of both periods.</description>

    <measure>Change in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(day 0), day 14, day 28, day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBSQOL) is a 30-item questionnaire that measures quality of life specific to IBS. The IBSQOL is validated and can be used to assess the impact of IBS and possible treatment interventions on quality of life. The following domains are measured: emotional health, mental health, energy, sleep, food/diet, social role, physical functioning, physical role and sexual relations. Scores range from 0 to 100% per domain. Higher scores indicate that IBS influences quality of life greater. Measured after both dietary periods and at baseline of both periods.</description>
