  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During VATS (Video assisted thoracic surgery) small incisions are made in the patient's chest
      through which a camera and instruments are inserted to allow a lung operation to be
      performed. Often patients experience a substantial amount of pain and difficult recovery
      after this type of operation. Anaesthesiologists sometimes use &quot;Regional Anaesthesia&quot; to
      minimise the pain and help patient recovery after the operation. This involves injecting
      local anaesthesia into the nerves around the chest wall to effectively numb that part of the
      chest. There is a variety of different locations on the chest wall where the local
      anaesthetic can be deposited and no study has measured whether one technique is better than
      the other in terms of improving patients' recovery experience. Our study compares two new
      techniques for Regional Anaesthesia after this type of surgery. Participants will be randomly
      assigned (like tossing a coin) to receive either a SAP (Serratus Anterior Plane) or ESP
      (Erector Spinae Plane) Block. Both techniques are described within last five years, but have
      never been compared for chest surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP) Block has been claimed to be a safer, technically less
      demanding alternative to paravertebral block and thoracic epidural in the management of post
      operative VATS associated pain . Recently, another new block, the Erector Spinae Block (ESP
      Block) has been described for use in thoracic wall surgery. It has also been claimed to be
      easier to perform than these more traditional methods of regional anaesthesia. No study to
      date has compared ESP to SAP blocks in terms of efficacy of post operative analgesia after
      VATS surgery. Furthermore, patient-centres outcome studies now demand that researchers
      evaluate more than acute pain in the early postoperative period: A 15-parameter Quality of
      Recovery score (QoR-15) has been recommended as the optimum tool to evaluate overall
      patient-centres measures of recovery after surgery, including pain. This study will test the
      hypothesis that patients receiving ESP Block have higher QoR-15 scores and better post
      operative analgesia in comparison with patients receiving SAP Block after VATS surgery.

    <description>A 15-parameter Quality of Recovery score (QoR-15) has been recommended as the optimum tool to evaluate overall patient-centres measures of recovery after surgery, including pain. It is a questionnaire that is given to patients to do post operatively and is scored from 0 to 150 where 150 indicates that the patient has a had an excellent recovery</description>
