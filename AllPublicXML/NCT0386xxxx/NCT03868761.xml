  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In October, 2017, Northern California experienced devastating and historic wildfires. Sonoma
      Rises is an app designed for anyone who was impacted by this event and is intended to help
      survivors of disaster find their new normal. This study will assess the feasibility and
      efficacy of a self-help post-disaster mental health intervention delivered via a mobile app
      with a sample of teens who are experiencing post-disaster mental health symptoms.

    <description>21 male and female teenage participants will be randomized to one of three varying baseline assessment periods of two, four, or six weeks. Multiple baseline is a type of single-case experimental design (SCED) that is a time- and cost-effective method for evaluating efficacy of a new treatment, Sonoma Rises. The randomization of participants to baseline periods of varying lengths enables assessment of whether symptom changes occur when, and only when, the intervention is applied.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive the intervention, Sonoma Rises, a mobile app designed by psychologists at the National Center for PTSD for wildfire survivors to facilitate recovery from disaster. Users can access evidence-informed tools to help cope with stress, heal from loss, prioritize self-care, connect with others, manage anger, and track their mood using validated assessments. There are also tools designed just for teens and users are linked to psychoeducation on disaster and health and other mental health resources and services.</description>
