  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will look at investigating barriers and facilitators and comparative
      adherence and effectiveness between a home-based and a Center based Pulmonary Rehabilitation
      Program in patients who have recently been hospitalized for a COPD related cause.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite proven benefits, the proportion of people with COPD who receive Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation (PR) is very small. The current model of a center-based PR program fails to
      address the needs of many patients with COPD. The most common patient barrier to attendance
      is travel to center-based programs, particularly for frail patients with more severe COPD who
      need transportation assistance. Home-based, unsupervised PR has been proposed as an
      alternative model to hospital-based programs and has been found to be safe and effective.

      In this pilot study we will investigate barriers and facilitators for doing pulmonary
      rehabilitation either home-based or center based after a hospitalization. The results of this
      pilot study will inform an upcoming randomized control study under a different grant. Both
      quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for the evaluation.

      The first 10 patients in this pilot study will not be randomized and allocated to home based
      PR in order to polish the intervention before the randomized portion of this pilot. This
      pilot is supported by a grant mechanism (R61) explicitly oriented to adjust the intervention
      for a future clinical study and identify barriers for not only in the intervention but also
      barriers for randomization.

    <description>The CRQ will be completed by participants several times during the study. The questionnaire measures health related quality of life and is a validated tool. This questionnaire measures both physical and emotional aspects of chronic respiratory disease. Higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.
