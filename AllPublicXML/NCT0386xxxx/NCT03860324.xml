  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thoracic erector spinae plane (ESP) block was first described by Forero et al in
      September 2016. In their article, the authors presented the possibility of using this block
      as an option for the control of thoracic neuropathic pain as well as post-operative thoracic
      pain. The ESP block is done by administering local anesthetic in the plane deep to the
      erector spinae muscle, which spreads through the costotransverse foramen to the dorsal and
      ventral roots of the spinal nerves.

      Since then, there have been reports about the successful use of this block for bariatric
      surgery, ventral hernia repair, radical mastectomy, rib fractures, major abdominal surgery
      and hip replacement. However, there are no studies in the literature comparing the efficacy
      of the ESP block to other nerve blocks.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the post-operative analgesic efficacy of the ESP
      block to the fascia iliaca (FI) block after total hip replacement (THR).

    <description>The patient is positioned in lateral decubitus. The anesthesiologist uses a linear high-frequency probe in a longitudinal direction laterally to the mid-sagittal plane at the level of L4 until the transverse process is identified and, more superficial, the erector spinae muscle. A 22G needle of 80mm is introduced in-plane craniocaudally towards the transverse process of L4 until its tip is in the plane deep to the erector spinae muscle. Single-shot block with 30ml of ropivacaine 0,5% + adrenaline 100mcg</description>

    <description>The patient is positioned in dorsal decubitus. The anesthesiologist uses a linear high-frequency probe in a transversal direction, below the crural arch so as to identify the femoral artery. Afterwards the probe is moved laterally to find the iliac muscle and its fascia. A 22G needle of 80mm is introduced in-plane latero-medially until its tip is below the fascia iliaca (between the muscle and its fascia). Single-shot block with 40ml of ropivacaine 0,2%.</description>
