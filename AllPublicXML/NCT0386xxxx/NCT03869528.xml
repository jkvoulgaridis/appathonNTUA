  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexible bronchoscopy is one of the most widely performed procedures for diagnosis of various
      bronchopulmonary diseases. Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough is often
      reported as a distressing symptom. It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy would be
      significantly improved with control of cough.

      Topical lignocaine is administered during bronchoscopy for local anaesthesia. There is
      uncertainty regarding the adequate dose of lignocaine sprays for pharyngeal anaesthesia
      during flexible bronchoscopy. This study would help to determine the optimal dose of
      lignocaine sprays for pharyngeal anaesthesia during flexible bronchoscopy.

      For all patients meeting the inclusion criteria, the demographic profile including age, sex,
      weight and the type of procedures performed during bronchoscopy shall be recorded. A written
      informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Enrolled patients will be randomized
      to receive either 5 or 10 sprays of 10% lignocaine to the pharynx. This will be followed by
      the standard topical anesthesia procedure followed in our institution involving 5ml of 2%
      lignocaine gel into the nostril. Transnasal flexible bronchoscopy will be performed with
      additional 1% lignocaine administered as &quot;spray as you go&quot; method. This will be given as 2 ml
      aliquots- with similar volume in both groups as baseline. Procedure shall be performed with
      administration of sedation using Midazolam and Fentanyl if required. Primary outcome will be
      assessed by noting the operator rated overall procedure satisfaction as a VAS scale score.
