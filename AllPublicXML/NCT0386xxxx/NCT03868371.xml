  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether a high phosphorous containing meal causes
      acute changes in p-phosphate levels in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disturbances in the mineral metabolism and especially the phosphate metabolism is associated
      with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with kidney failure. In
      the healthy population the kidney compensates for a high phosphorous intake by increase renal
      excretion of phosphate, but this is not possible for patients with kidney failure. Due to
      this monitoring and controlling phosphate levels is an important clinical goal in treatment
      of kidney failure, and it is often achieved with a phosphorous poor diet and phosphate
      binders.

      Currently this monitoring of the phosphate level is complicated by a poor understanding of
      how plasma phosphate acutely reacts to a phosphate rich meal. Often patients may have
      consumed a phosphate rich meal shortly before their blood test is taken, which may have an
      acute impact on the plasma phosphate level in the blood test and complicated the task of
      assessing their chronic phosphate levels.

      To examine this problem, the investigators wish to conduct a randomized cross-over trial,
      where peritoneal dialysis patients are recruited and randomly assigned to consume either a
      meal either high or low in phosphate on the first day of trial and the opposite in the
      second.

      With blood tests just before and during 5 hours after the meal, the investigators will
      examine plasma-phosphate levels as well as other blood parameters of importance to the
      mineral metabolism to determine, whether a meal rich in phosphate causes significant changes
      in these test parameters compared to a meal poor in phosphate.
