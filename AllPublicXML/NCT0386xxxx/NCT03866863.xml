  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with an increase in perinatal mortality
      and morbidity, as well as longer-term neurological, cognitive, cardiovascular and endocrine
      complications. In Europe, about 400,000 pregnancies per year are complicated by IUGR.
      However, antenatal diagnosis seems insufficient in clinical practice, making it impossible to
      recognize up to 75% of foetuses with IUGR. At a time when the use of good clinical practice
      has demonstrated a significant improvement in neonatal survival without severe morbidity,
      foetuses with IUGR are less likely to receive optimal care. Our hypothesis is that the rate
      of IUGR diagnosed underestimates the rate of actual IUGR.
