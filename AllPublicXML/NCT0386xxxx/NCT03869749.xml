  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Learning to BREATHE (a
      mindfulness intervention for adolescents) plus an ecological momentary intervention (Learning
      to Breathe Plus), and will examine the extent to which mindfulness reduces dysregulated
      stress physiology, perceived stress, and anxiety in adolescents from high conflict homes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents from homes with interparental conflict will be randomly assigned to Learning to
      BREATHE Plus (the standard group program designed to increase mindfulness, plus a
      multi-method adaptive intervention that will be comprised of an ecological momentary
      intervention and online library of mindfulness practices) or to a health and wellness active
      control condition to determine feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of
      Learning to BREATHE Plus.

    <measure>Mindfulness, self-reported</measure>

    <description>Adolescents reported mindfulness (Mindfulness Awareness and Attention Scale, Adolescent Version; Brown, West, Loverich, &amp; Biegel, 2011). There are 14 items on this scale, each answered on a scale from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). Answer across 14 items are averaged such that higher scores indicate higher trait mindfulness (minimum = 1; maximum = 6).</description>

    <measure>Self-compassion, self-reported</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Compassion Scale, short form (Raes, Pommier, Neff, &amp; Van Gucht, 2011). This scale has 12 items, answered on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). There are 6 subscales measured on this scale, each with 2 items: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. Subscale and total scores are calculated based on means after reverse scoring so that high scores indicate higher self-compassion (minimum: 1; maximum: 5).</description>

    <measure>Adolescent reports of emotion regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). This scale has 36 items that measure difficulties in 6 sub-dimensions of emotion regulation: nonacceptance of emotional responses (6 items: minimum: 1; maximum: 36), difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior (5 items: minimum: 1; maximum: 30), impulse control difficulties (6 items: minimum: 1; maximum: 36), lack of emotional awareness (6 items: minimum: 1; maximum: 36), limited access to emotion regulation strategies (8 items: minimum: 1, maximum 48), and lack of emotional clarity (5 items: minimum: 1; maximum: 30). Questions are answered on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Subscale and total scores are summed such that higher scores indicate greater difficulties with emotion regulation (total scores: minimum: 1, maximum: 180).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parent and adolescent reported youth anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto, &amp; Francis, 2000). This scale has 47 items answered on a scale from 0 (never) to 3 (always), and answers are summed. Total scores range from 0 to 141, with higher scores reflecting more symptoms of anxiety and depression. Subscales can also be used to calculate scores for separation anxiety (7 items; minimum: 0, maximum: 21), social anxiety (9 items; minimum: 0, maximum 27), obsessive/compulsions (6 items; minimum: 0, maximum: 18), panic/agoraphobia (9 items; minimum: 0, maximum: 27), generalized anxiety (6 items; minimum: 0, maximum: 18), and major depression (10 items; minimum: 0, maximum: 30), with higher scores reflecting more symptoms.</description>
