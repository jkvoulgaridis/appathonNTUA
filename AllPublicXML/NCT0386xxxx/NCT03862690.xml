    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information about how NovoMix® 30 works in real world
      adult population with type 2 diabetes. Participants will get NovoMix® 30 as prescribed by the
      study doctor. The study will last for about 6-8 months. Participants will be asked questions
      about their health and their diabetes treatment as part of their study doctor's appointment.

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction (DTSQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (week 0) to end of study (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The DTSQs is a self-completion questionnaire used to assess subject's treatment satisfaction. The DTSQ total score will be based on item 1 and 4-8, which are scored on a scale from 0 to 36, a higher score related to a better perception of treatment satisfaction. Items 2 and 3 will be reported separately on a scale from 0 to 6 as per instruction in the DTSQs manual.</description>

    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (week 0) to end of study (week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire will be used to assess subject's health-related quality of life. This instrument contains 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and measures 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). The EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical VAS with scores 0-100.</description>
