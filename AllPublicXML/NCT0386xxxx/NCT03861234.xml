        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Men and women over the age of 55 with active Choroidal Neovascularisation (CNV) secondary
        to Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) despite anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
        (VEGF) therapies (at least 3 prior injections with the last injection within 12 to 4 weeks
        before screening). Active CNV secondary to AMD is to be defined either by recent
        fluorescein or OCT angiogram within 4 weeks prior to screening or fluorescein or Optical
        coherence tomography (OCT) angiogram obtained prior to first anti VEGF-treatment to confirm
        the diagnosis and still active according to investigator judgement.

        For Multiple Rising Dose (MRD) part only: No more than 18 months elapsed since the first
        anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye

          -  For MRD part only: Central subfield retinal thickness &gt;350 microns in the study eye on
             Heidelberg Spectralis Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)

          -  Presence of sub- and/or intraretinal fluid on SD-OCT in the study eye

          -  Any active CNV with subfoveal leakage in the study eye as determined by OCT

          -  No subretinal hemorrhage involving the fovea in the study eye No significant subfoveal
             fibrosis or atrophy on SD-OCT in the study eye that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, is able to prevent improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)
             and/or Central Subfield Thickness (CSFT)

          -  Best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Visual Acuity (VA)
             in the study eye between 70 and 24 letters inclusive (approximately 20/40 and 20/320
             or 6/12 and 6/95) at screening.

          -  Best-corrected VA in the non-study eye better than best-corrected VA in the study-eye.
             If both eyes are eligible and have identical VA the investigator may select the study
             eye.

          -  Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential

          -  Signed informed consent consistent with ICH GCP guidelines and local legislation prior
             to participation in the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions

             regulatory or juridical order

        Exclusion criteria:

             Acuity (VA)(BCVA) with visual field loss, uncontrolled glaucoma (Intra-Ocular Pressure
             (IOP)&gt;24), clinically significant diabetic maculopathy, history of ischemic optic
             neuropathy or retinal vascular occlusion, symptomatic vitreomacular traction, or
             genetic disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa); history of high myopia &gt; 8 diopters
             in the study eye. Anterior segment and vitreous abnormalities in the study eye that
             would preclude adequate observation with Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography
             (SD-OCT)

          -  Any prior intraocular surgery in the study eye other then uneventful lens replacement
             for cataract within 3 months prior to screening

          -  Current or planned use of medications known to be toxic to the retina, lens or optic
             nerve (e.g. desferoxamine, chloroquine/hydrochloroquine, chlorpromazine,

             hypertension

          -  Patients with a clinically relevant abnormal screening haematology, blood chemistry,
             or urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in other
             exclusion criteria. AST or ALT greater than 2.0-fold the upper limit of normal at
             screening. Patients with total bilirubin 2.5x upper limit of normal at screening.

          -  Patient with impaired renal function defined as calculated GFR&lt; 30 mL/min

          -  Significant alcohol or drug abuse within past 2 years per investigator judgement

          -  Previous participation in this trial or in other trials with Intravitreal (IVT)
             injections or in trials for treatment of Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (wAMD).

          -  Significant disease or other medical conditions (as determined by medical history,
             examination and clinical investigations at screening) that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator result in the any of the following:

               -  Put the patient at risk because of participation in the study,

               -  Influence the results of the study,

               -  Cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to fluorescein or any of the ingredients used in the
             Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) formulation, or any of the medications used
