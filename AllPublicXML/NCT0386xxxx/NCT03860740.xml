      Observational study to evaluate the effect of physical exercise prior to surgery and adjuvant
      systemic treatment in women with newly diagnosed operable hormone receptor(HR)-positive,

      Effect of exercise on tumor aggressiveness and the impact on patients' quality of life.

      Exercise is a safe and effective treatment for women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), that
      has an integral benefit during and after treatments, however, the effect at the tumour
      microenvironment it is unknown; previous studies have evaluated the association between
      exercise and BC, finding a positive influence on it, which suggest that exercise could reduce
      the aggressiveness of the tumour. This study will explore the exercise impact in tumor
      microenvironment, as part of the therapy given to the patients prior to surgery and
      treatment. In addition, different serum biomarkers involved and the tailoring of exercise for
      these women will be evaluated. The effect of exercise on treatments secondary effects,
      biomarkers and quality of life will be evaluated after 6 months of BC surgery. This project
      will open a window of opportunity to explore new translational research as well as new
      treatment vias to the patients of this breast cancer subgroup.

    <measure>Change in fatigue levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-surgery, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in fatigue levels will be assessed by questionnaire Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue (FACT-F). The physical well-being domain has 7 items with scores from 0 to 28 points; social/family well-being, 7 items with score from 0 to 28 points; emotional well-being, 6 items with score from 0 to 24 points; functional well-being, 7 items with score from 0 to 28 points; and fatigue subscale, 13 items with score from 0 to 52. Each item has ﬁve likert-type options graduated from 0 to 4: &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little bit&quot;; Somewhat&quot;; &quot;Quite a bit&quot;; &quot;Very much'. The ﬁnal score of FACT-F is obtained by adding the scores of the ﬁve domains, and may vary from 0 to 160 points. The higher the number of points, the better the quality of life and the less the fatigue of the patients is. To obtain the score, the negative questions are reverted; then the answers of the domains are added up, and a proportional average is carried out in case of non answered items.</description>

    <time_frame>Post-surgery, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life levels will be assessed by questionnaire Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Breast Cancer (FACT-B). The FACT-B is a breast cancer-specific HRQoL instrument of the FACIT system. The 37-item are divided into five subscales, namely physical (PWB), social/family (SWB), emotional (EWB), functional well-beings (FWB), and the additional concerns for breast cancer (BCS). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Negatively worded items were recoded such that a higher score indicates a better HRQoL. The FACT-B total score is the sum of scores of all five subscales.</description>

    <measure>Change in depression levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-surgery, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in depression levels will be assessed by questionnaire Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a 20-item measure assessing symptoms of depression with items phrased as self-statements (e.g., &quot;I felt hopeful about the future&quot;). Respondents rate how frequently each item applied to them over the course of the past week. Ratings were based on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time [less than 1 day]) to 3 (most or all of the time [5-7 days]).</description>
