    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, the second deadliest
      cancer in the United States. DNA methylation is a commonly used biomarker for non-invasive
      CRC detection in plasma. The low sensitivity of blood-based tests is due to several
      limitations of detecting ctDNA in early-stage cancer. We developed and validated a
      high-throughput methylation-based blood test highly sensitive for colorectal cancer and
      precancerous lesions. This previously established colorectal tumor-specific plasma ctDNA
      methylation markers (diagnostic model established by next-generation sequencing of 2181 gene
      loci methylation) had a high sensitivity in CRC patients and a high specificity in healthy
      individuals in a large retrospective sample study. This prospective, clinical study is to
      further evaluate the sensitivity of plasma ctDNA methylation haplotypes in detecting local
      residual or lymph node metastasis.

        Patients with endoscopically removed malignant polyps must have baseline evaluations
        performed prior to the study and must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. In
        addition, the patient must be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study, including
        the study visit schedule and required evaluations and all regulatory requirements for
        informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with endoscopically removed malignant polyps.

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.

          -  Patients who received surgical resection following removal of malignant polyps by
             colonoscopy.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of ≤1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from patient or patient's legal
             representative and ability for patient to comply with the requirements of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients received adjuvant treatment prior to the surgical resection.

          -  Patients received blood transfusion two weeks before or during the surgical resection.

          -  Patients with unresected advanced colorectal adenoma.

          -  Patients who are positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or
             Hepatitis C.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

          -  Patients who are alcoholic or drug abusers.

          -  Patients with a history or current evidence of any condition or abnormality that might
             confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's participation for the
             full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to
             participate, in the opinion of the Investigator.
