  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole Body Vibration Therapy (WBVT) has been identified as a useful tool to increase
      peripheral blood flow. The present study aimed at how dynamic exercises with WBVT immediate
      effect on hemodynamic response and fatigue parameters in patients with obesity.

    <intervention_model_description>Active Whole Body Vibration (aWBVT) group, performed ten dynamic standard exercises on a vibration platform. The vibration protocol lasted for 15 minutes, in a frequency of 30 Hz and amplitude of 2 mm. Control group performed only ten dynamic standard exercises with no vibration application. Blood Pressure, heart rate, saturated oxygen were measured for the hemodynamic response. Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale (MBDS) and The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (BRPE) Scale were used in order to evaluate fatigue level. All evaluations were performed at the beginning of the study, at the end of the session and at the recovery period</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Exercises were taught during the first session, active training was done in the second session, and acute evaluations were made during the third session. Both groups performed the dynamic exercises, under supervision, on the whole body vibration device with 10-second rest intervals. Throughout the WBVT session, the vibration amplitude was set to 2 mm and exercise frequency 30 Hz.</description>

    <description>Whole Body Vibration Training (WBVT) method has been used as an alternative to conventional strengthening exercises. In this method, the patient stands on the platform of the WBVT device in a static position or performs dynamic exercises, the mechanical vibration produced by the device is transferred to the body</description>
