  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While historically anesthesiologists rely on pharmacokinetics to track the loss of
      consciousness, new research in anesthesiology has identified the salient features of the
      electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlate to states of sedation and unconsciousness induced
      by different anesthetic drugs. While the EEG features of many sedative-hypnotic anesthetics
      have been well- characterized, the opioid analgesic drugs have not been analyzed in detail in
      this way. A characterization of the EEG signatures of opioid analgesic drugs could be useful
      in monitoring and titrating the effects of these drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fentanyl is one of the most commonly used opioid analgesic drugs. Prior to induction of
      general anesthesia, fentanyl is frequently administered to blunt the nociceptive response to
      intubation. A typical scenario is to administer 2 to 4 mcg/kg of fentanyl first, followed by
      a sedative hypnotic drug such as propofol to induce general anesthesia. In this study, we
      propose to administer a total of 4 mcg/kg of fentanyl, administered in 2 boluses, before
      administering a sedative hypnotic drug. At this dose, fentanyl will serve to blunt
      nociception during intubation, but will also contribute to intraoperative pain management.
      During this time, we will record the EEG using standard EEG-based anesthetic monitors that
      are routinely used in the operating room. We will assess the patient's level of
      responsiveness using an auditory task and ulnar nerve stimulation. These measurements will
      allow us to identify the EEG signatures of fentanyl for future use in EEG-based anesthetic
      monitoring. During this study we will measure EEG and responses to auditory and ulnar nerve
      stimuli during induction of general anesthesia in surgical patients. The anesthetic will be
      administered according to a typical sequence in which fentanyl is first administered,
      followed by a sedative hypnotic drug for induction of general anesthesia. The primary
      difference is that, in this study, we will record the EEG and response data for a short
      period of time after initial administration of fentanyl and prior to administration of a
      sedative hypnotic drug to induce general anesthesia.
