    <textblock>
      This trial studies best dose and how well repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      works in promoting smoking cessation and preventing relapse in current smokers. rTMS is a
      form of brain stimulation therapy that controls nerve cell activity, increases blood flow in
      the brain, and improves cognitive function.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of stimulation duration (stimulation days) and intensity (pulses
      per day) on outcomes among smokers (sample size [n]=258) motivated to quit.

      II. To identify the most promising dosing strategy by balancing effect sizes and undesirable
      effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo rTMS once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) over 16 minutes for 8, 12,
      or 16 days.

      ARM II: Patients undergo sham rTMS QD or BID over 16 minutes for 8, 12, or 16 days.

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Latency to relapse will be defined as the number of days from the quit day to relapse. Relapse will be defined as smoking for seven consecutive days. Will use Cox proportional-hazards (CPH) models to examine latency to relapse outcome. Ties in failure times will be handled using methods developed by Efron. Compliance with the CPH assumptions will be tested by coding the factors as time-dependent covariates.</description>
