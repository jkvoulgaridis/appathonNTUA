  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to discover clinically useful tests to improve the diagnosis of a rare and
      serious heart muscle disease caused by mutations in a gene called 'Lamin'.

      Patients born with lamin gene mutations have apparently healthy hearts initially, they begin
      experiencing symptoms in their twenties or thirties, and by age 45 the majority have
      undergone a heart transplant, experienced a major cardiac complication, or have died. Sudden
      heart rhythm abnormalities are a major cause of sudden death so earlier diagnosis can save
      lives by enabling timely treatment or implantation of specialised pacemakers
      (defibrillators). In clinical practice, diagnosis of lamin heart disease currently relies on
      the genetic test. Very little is known about the detailed imaging features of the hearts of
      patients with lamin heart disease although advanced echocardiography and cardiac MRI now
      offer the opportunity to study the health of the heart without the need for radiation.

      -  Research participants will undergo resting 12-lead ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, baseline
           echocardiography, exercise echocardiography, cardiac MRI scan.

        -  Blood samples will be collected in all participants from both centers for immediate
           laboratory testing.

        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected in all participants and used for metabolomic,
           proteomic and lipidomic profiling and for targeted metabolite and enzyme analysis.

        -  Blood samples will be collected in all participants for future gene code analysis (DNA /
           RNA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  LMNA+ cases with pathogenic LMNA mutations for LMNA+ and heart myocardial samples from
             the explanted hearts of LMNA+ patients who are scheduled to undergo clinically
             indicated heart transplantation at the Papworth Hospital NHS Trust.

          -  DCMWT cases: patients with heart muscle failure but with wild-type lamin gene. Heart
             myocardial samples from the explanted hearts of DCMWT patients who are scheduled to
             undergo clinically indicated heart transplantation at the Papworth Hospital NHS Trust.

          -  HV (controls): matched to cases.

        Exclusion Criteria:
