    <measure>Rate of patients with improvement in adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary analysis will compare scores of adjusted INCAT Disability Scale evaluated prior to treatment (at the time of enrollment) and scores at each timepoint after week 26 to calculate the proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of one and more from the baseline.
The INCAT Disability Scale is an index to evaluate disorders in lower (gait) and upper (elevation of the upper arms and fine movement of the fingertips) extremities. The INCAT score is a 10-point scale and ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (worst). For the &quot;adjusted&quot; INCAT score, a change in upper extremity score from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 will not be considered meaningful in this evaluation.</description>
