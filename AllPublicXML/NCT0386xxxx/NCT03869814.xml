  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to develop a biospecimen archive comprised of tissues
      and whole blood specimens obtained from a cohort of subjects undergoing a diagnostic
      evaluation for cancer arising in diverse organ tissues, as well as from a cohort of subjects
      without cancer. Multiple molecular technologies will be used to identify and assess candidate
      biomarkers for use in enhancing the understanding of cancer biology and developing tools to
      improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 21 years old

          2. Clinical suspicion of malignancy based on signs, symptoms, imaging studies, and/or
             non-surgical biopsies of any of the following cancer types: bladder, breast,
             colorectal, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas or prostate.

          3. Candidate for subsequent medical and/or surgical work-up to complete organ-specific
             cancer diagnosis inclusive of pathologic staging as specified by the College of
             American Pathology (CAP).

          4. Provision of informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Any prior cancer diagnosis, without or with any treatment (e.g., medical, surgical, or
             radiation oncology) within prior six months.

          3. Any surgery, i.e., invasive procedure performed in the operating room with any level
             of anesthesia, within prior month.

          4. Any non-cancer systemic therapy associated with molecularly targeted immune
             modulation, e.g., monoclonal antibodies.

          5. Any concurrent or prior pregnancy within previous twelve months.
