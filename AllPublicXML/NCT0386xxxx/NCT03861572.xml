  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early rehabilitation protocols have been studied in Achilles tendon (AT) rupture patients,
      but deficits in tendon biomechanical properties have been observed several years after the
      injury. AT rupture patients are unable to return to their previous levels of physical
      activity. They present deleterious adaptations in the plantar flexor muscles that lead to
      functional deficits, and deficits in the tendon's structural and mechanical properties.
      Eccentric contractions have been suggested to recover these muscle properties. This
      contraction is known to produce higher force compared to isometric and concentric
      contractions, and increases tendon stiffness. However, there is a lack of studies showing the
      effects of the eccentric training in AT rupture rehabilitation. We want to know if an
      isokinetic eccentric training program will determine the desired adaptations on triceps surae
      muscle-tendon unit's properties in patients subjected to the AT surgical repair. More
      specifically, the aim of this study is verifying the effects of a 12-week eccentric training
      program on triceps surae muscle-tendon unit's properties in subjects that were subjected to
      the AT surgical repair. 30 subjects will be randomized in two groups: (1) isokinetic
      eccentric training; and (2) traditional eccentric training control group. All participants
      will be submitted to a four-week control period, followed by a 12-week period of training for
      the plantar flexor muscles. Neuromuscular system properties, AT biomechanical properties and
      functional tests will be evaluated. Participants will be evaluated in four moments: at
      baseline; after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of rehabilitation. Tendon mechanical (stiffness, stress,
      strain), material (Young's modulus) and morphological (cross-sectional area and tendon
      length) properties; muscle architecture (thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length); and
      functional tests (heel rise resistance and height) will be analyzed between groups and
      periods. Effects and interactions will be analyzed with ANOVA two-way. Clinical effects will
      be analyzed using effect size and magnitude-based inferences.

      Detailed Description: Early rehabilitation protocols have been studied in Achilles tendon
      (AT) rupture patients, but deficits in tendon biomechanical properties have been observed
      several years after the injury. AT rupture patients are unable to return to their previous
      levels of physical activity. They present deleterious adaptations in the plantar flexor
      muscles that lead to functional deficits and deficits in the tendon structural and mechanical
      properties. Deficits in calf muscle endurance and strength remained 7 years after the injury.
      In this regards, eccentric contractions are recommended to recover muscle morphology and
      mechanical properties. This contraction type produces higher force compared to isometric and
      concentric contractions, and increases tendon stiffness. However, there is a lack of studies
      showing the effect of the eccentric training in AT rupture rehabilitation. We want to know if
      an isokinetic eccentric training program will determine the desired adaptations on triceps
      surae muscle-tendon unit's properties in patients subjected to the AT surgical repair. More
      specifically, the aim of this study is verifying the effects of a 12-week eccentric training
      program on triceps surae muscle-tendon unit's properties in subjects that were subjected to
      the AT surgical repair. Our hypothesis is that the eccentric training program will (1)
      increase the ability to produce muscular strength; (2) will produce an increase in
      gastrocnemius and soleus muscles thickness, fascicle length, and pennation angle; (3) will
      increase AT stiffness and Young's modulus; (4) will increase ankle functionality; (5) will
      improve the patient's quality of life. Finally, we expect that the abovementioned changes
      from isokinetic eccentric training will be greater than those from the traditional eccentric
      control group that will be subjected to 12 weeks of plantar flexor training with weights. 30
      subjects will be randomized in two groups: (1) isokinetic eccentric training; and (2)
      traditional eccentric training control group. All participants will be submitted to a
      four-week control period, followed by a 12- week period of training for the plantar flexor
      muscles. Neuromuscular system properties, AT biomechanical properties and functional tests
      will be evaluated. Participants will be evaluated in four moments: at baseline; after 4, 8
      and 12 weeks of rehabilitation. Tendon mechanical (stiffness, stress, strain), material
      (Young's modulus) and morphological (cross sectional area and tendon length) properties;
      muscle architecture (thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length); and functional tests
      (heel rise resistance and height) will be analyzed between groups and periods. Effects and
      interactions will be analyzed with ANOVA two- way (group x period). Clinical effects will be
      analyzed using effect size (Cohen`s d) and magnitude-based inferences.

    <description>To obtain the Achilles tendon cross-sectional area (CSA), the US probe (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Washington, USA) will be placed perpendicular to the tendon (in the transverse plane), and 3 images will be obtained with reference to the distances of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 cm of the muscle insertion in the calcaneus bone (ARYA and KULIG, 2010). Area values will be obtained for each image, and the final value of the area will be calculated by the average of these five values.</description>

    <description>To obtain Achilles tendon length, the US (LOGIQ P6, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Washington, USA) and a linear matrix array transducer (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Washington, USA) will be placed longitudinally to the tendon (in the sagittal plane). The most distal portion of the Achilles tendon, inserted into the calcaneus bone, will be determined by US, and the respective point will be marked on the skin. After this, the probe will be moved to a proximal position until the visualization of the medial gastrocnemius myotendinous junction (MTJ), which is also marked on the skin. The distance between the two marked points on the skin will be measured with a measuring tape, this distance being considered representative of the tendon length (ARYA and KULIG, 2010; GEREMIA et al., 2015; GEREMIA and VAZ, 2016).</description>

    <description>Muscular architecture will be evaluated with an US system and a linear matrix array probe (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Washington, USA). Muscle architecture parameters will involve fascicle length, pennation angle and muscle thickness (NARICI, 1999). Echo-intensity of the medial gastrocnemius will also be evaluated. The images will be obtained with the subjects in the ventral decubitus position on a stretcher, with the knees extended and the ankle in neutral position (heel line at a 90° angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the leg, 0° of plantarflexion). A custom system will be used to secure the ankle in the neutral position. The probe will be positioned longitudinally to the muscle fibers at 30% proximal for medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and 50% for soleus, of the distance between the popliteal fold and the lateral malleolus center (KAWAKAMI et al., 1998).</description>

    <description>To calculate the calf muscles perimetry, the leg length will be determined from the distance between the center of the lateral malleolus and the popliteal fossa at the knee. From the determination of this distance, the value corresponding to 30% of the distance from the articular line of the knee will be calculated for the measurement of the leg perimetry (MIYATANI et al., 2004)</description>

    <measure>Muscle echo-intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>First evaluation, change from baseline to 4 weeks of training, change from baseline to 8 weeks of training and change from baseline to 12 weeks of training</time_frame>
    <description>For the echo-intensity evaluation, the probe will be positioned transversally at the proximal 30% of the lower leg length (AKAGI et al., 2018). Three images will be recorded in the same position of the muscle architecture. Echo-intensity has been associated with force production (CADORE et al., 2012; RECH et al., 2014; AKAGI et al., 2018), an aspect that we want to analyze is if there is some correlation among structural and functional variables</description>

    <description>Gastrocnemius and sóleo muscles electromyography (EMG) signals will be measured through pairs of passive surface electrodes (Ag/AgCl, Meditrace, Kendall, Canada) in bipolar configuration. A reference electrode will be placed on the skin covering the anterior surface of the tibia, according to the procedures proposed by the Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM, 2018). The electrodes will be fixed on the skin and a slight pressure will be applied on them to increase the contact between the electrode gel and the skin. The electrodes placement will respect the recommendations proposed by (SENIAM, 2018).</description>

    <description>The isokinetic eccentric training will be carried out with the volunteers positioned seated on the dynamometer with the apparent axis of the ankle joint rotation aligned with the dynamometer's axis of rotation. Movement will be executed in the angular velocity of 30°·s-1. Ankle range of motion (ROM) will be standardized for all participants in 50º, which shall respect each individual's maximal dorsiflexion amplitude. The 50° eccentric training ROM will start from each subject's 80% of the maximal dorsiflexion. This procedure will be used to ensure that all subjects perform training on the same plantar flexor muscular length, which should promote the same level of muscular requirement among the participants. This methodology was recently used by GEREMIA and VAZ (2016) study.</description>

    <description>Participants will be engaged in an intervention program consisting of 12 weeks of traditional eccentric training. The training will be carried out with the volunteers at gym in stand position. Concentric phase will be realized with both legs and the eccentric one only with one of them. Training progression will be the same from de isokinetic eccentric group. The same periodization from eccentric group will be used to permit us a posteriori comparison between groups. Training sessions will be performed at university gym, twice a week, with a minimum interval of 72 hours between sessions.
