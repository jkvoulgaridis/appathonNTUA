  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the bioequivalence and the within-subject variability
      between the test formulation of extended-release tablet of cilostazol (PMR) administered once
      daily and the reference formulation of immediate-release tablet of cilostazol (Cilostazol)
      administered twice-daily in normal healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions.

                  contraception (e.g. implantable, injectable, vaginal, patch, and oral), and
                  double-barrier methods. Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout
                  the study and for seven (7) days after study discontinuation.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drug(s).
