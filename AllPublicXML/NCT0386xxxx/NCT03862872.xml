      This is a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel
      intervention study including three groups of 25 subjects between 35-65 years of age, treated
      with either Bend Beauty's Anti-Aging Formula, fish oil control or inert placebo for 90 days,
      with testing points at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days.

      This is a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel
      intervention study including three groups of 25 subjects between 35-65 years of age, treated
      with either Bend Beauty's Anti-Aging Formula, fish oil control or inert placebo for 90 days,
      with testing points at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days.

      Subjects will be preselected through a Subject Eligibility Screening (SES) against defined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry into the trial. Eligible participants will be
      tested using the Chronic Inflammation Test for urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2
      (https://chronicinflammationtest.com) and the Omega-3 Index Test for eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in red blood cells (RBC) (https://omegaquant.com ), to
      confirm possible presence of chronic inflammation. If these test results meet a defined
      limit, participants will be enrolled in the trial.

      A number of assessments will be conducted before and after treatment.

    <masking_description>Subject Code Numbers assigned to subjects using 400 randomly generated numbers ranging from 1-1000 are associated with all data generated in place of the subject name.
Product Code Numbers on Test Materials, using 90 randomly generated numbers ranging from 1-99, are assigned by a Data Manager. All subsequent documentation will be labelled with the Product Code Number. Test material identity will not be shared with any participants within the trial [i.e. Subjects, Principal Investigator (PI), Clinical Research Monitor (CRM), Test Material Controller (TMC), Study Site Monitor &amp; Quality Specialist (SM&amp;QS), Data Analyst]. The only person who will be aware of the test material identity relative to any Product Code Number will be the Data Manager.
Unmasking of the Product Code Numbers will be by the Data Manager, once statistical analysis is complete.</masking_description>

    <description>Subjective assessment of mental well-being/depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 after treatment with Anti-Aging Formula, control fish oil and inert placebo. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 is available in the public domain, and is employed to capture data more focused on mental health indicators of depression. It is a version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care to monitor severity of depression and response to treatment. Results are presented as a score ranging from 0-27, where 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, and 20-27 is severe depression.</description>

    <description>Subjective assessment of skin condition using Observ 520 Skin Analysis (http://www.observ.uk.com/) after treatment with Anti-Aging Formula, control fish oil and inert placebo. Observ 520 Skin Analysis measures skin condition in the epidermal and dermal layers using skin fluorescence and polarized light illumination technology to produce visual indicators of skin's condition.The technology allows overlay of one photo on top of another to enable comparative changes before and after treatment. Numerical data will be created by comparing before and after treatment photos and assigning the descriptors: &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot;, or &quot;worsened&quot; that correspond to the values +1, 0, or -1, respectively. The average numerical value from each of the three treatment arms will then be calculated and compared, which will be used as quantitative measures of the treatments' effects on skin condition.</description>

    <description>The control fish oil is a soft gelatin capsule containing 1,106 mg of triglyceride fish oil from anchovies, sardines, and/or mackerel whole body oil. A four capsule per day dose provides 816 mg EPA and 572 mg DHA, which is only slightly less EPA+DHA than is provided within a four capsule per day dose of Anti-Aging Formula. This minor difference would not be expected to alter clinical outcomes.</description>
