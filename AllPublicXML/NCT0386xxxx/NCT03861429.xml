  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the Me &amp; My Wishes intervention positively
      impacts communication of preferences among nursing home residents with dementia and their
      family caregivers and care team.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Me &amp; My Wishes are videos of nursing home residents talking about their preferences for care,
      including four sections: About Me, Preferences for Today, Preferences for Medical
      Intervention and End of Life, and Afterthoughts. Knowing what residents want is essential to
      staff's ability to provide quality care and can inform family caregivers decision making
      especially in later stages of life as the resident's cognition declines—a time when family
      caregivers often feel unprepared. Persons with mild to moderate dementia can accurately
      express their everyday and EOL preferences, however, stereotypes persist about the decision
      making abilities of people with dementia that often prevent their involvement in
      conversations about care. The investigators propose to conduct a Stage II efficacy trial of
      Me &amp; My Wishes—a novel approach for communicating resident care preferences—by creating
      videos with 48-54 nursing home residents with mild to moderate dementia and sharing their
      personalized video with informal (family) and formal (staff) caregivers. The investigators
      will employ a randomized wait-list control design in which residents in control nursing homes
      will delay sharing their video. Videos may be viewed two ways: 1) in resident quarterly care
      conferences; and 2) via a web-based link with resident-identified family members or friends.
