    <description>will be defined as a &gt;10 db loss from baseline in any frequency, based on the lower threshold of the American Speech and Hearing Associations (ASHA) hearing change criteria. For children unable to cooperate for an audiogram, the DPOAE will be the primary measurement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of the
             protocol.

          -  Children with RB aged 3 months and older who are scheduled to receive their first dose
             of IA carboplatin chemotherapy.

               -  Retinoblastoma is rarely seen in children over 8 years old, however we will not
                  include an upper age range so as not to exclude any possible participants

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with known and documented preexisting hearing loss.
