    <textblock>
      Worldwide, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis, and chronic
      infection with HBV often leads to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
      carcinoma. So far, the most effective way to prevent HBV infection in susceptible population
      is to inject hepatitis B vaccine. However, long-term protection against hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) after vaccination remains widely debated. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a
      modified 3-dose booster protocol in neonatally vaccinated children in Chongqing.

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection is a major public health problem around the world. More
      than 2 billion people have been infected with HBV. Although the World Health Organization (
      WHO ) has incorporated hepatitis B vaccination into routine immunization programs for infants
      and adolescents since 1986 to reduce the incidence of chronic liver diseases, liver cirrhosis
      and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis B virus, there are still more than 400
      million chronic carriers. Although it is currently recognized that the most effective way to
      prevent HBV infection in susceptible population is to inject hepatitis B vaccine, the
      protective effect of the neonatally vaccinated children weakened as time goes on, which
      involves the question of the need of boosters. However, there are still some problems
      concerning hepatitis B vaccine boosters for healthy children. In China, there has not been a
      standardized directory to guide hepatitis B vaccine booster. Scholars have great controversy
      on the necessity, age, dosage and other aspects of hepatitis B vaccine booster. Researchers
      conducted an investigation on the Anti-HBs level of 93,326 Chinese children aged 1 - 16 who
      completed basic immunization. The results showed that the proportion of HBsAb positive in
      children aged 1 - 8 years old decreased dramatically, with 8 - year - old children having the
      lowest proportion of protective antibody. Therefore, this study is intended to explore the
      protective effect of hepatitis B vaccine on the body and the effect of multiple vaccines.This
      study will recruit some healthy children in Chongqing and conduct selective re-vaccination
      according to the results of the first detection of hepatitis B surface markers in healthy
      children. According to the changes of immune status after booster, the efficacy of hepatitis
      B vaccine boosters was comprehensively evaluated.
