  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to recruit about 800 volunteers with 400 malignant cases and 400 benign
      cases (negative results included). The information acquired from those cases mainly includes:
      image acquirement parameters, physical examination data of patients, scanning positions,
      radiological images and diagnosis reports of CBBCT, mammography, breast ultrasound, MRI (if
      any), pathologic reports, follow-up reports and the like. The image quality comprehensive
      evaluation and multi-observer, multi-case diagnostic comparing experiment will be processed.
      With the pathologic report as gold standard, diagnostic comparing experiment between CBBCT
      and mammography, breast ultrasound, MRI will be designed to determine the differences between
      various lesions' presentation on CBBCT and on other approaches with diverse breast conditions
      (size, density).

      The problems to be solved in this study include:

        1. Standardize the scanning positons, equipment parameter settings and other technical
           essentials based on the comprehensive analysis of image data acquisition, image quality
           and diverse patients' conditions, so as to guarantee image quality stability.

        2. Summarize the breast anatomic features, typical and atypical lesions' characteristics on
           CBBCT image based on the analysis of 3D-CBBCT data and pathologic results as well as the
           comparing of CBBCT with other approaches, so as to establish the radiological diagnostic
           standard of CBBCT.

        3. Standardize the application consensus of CBBCT based on the image features, data
           acquisition process and patients' conditions.
