      This phase I/II trial studies how well patient portal and navigation program work in
      providing information for Asian American cancer patients. Patient portal and navigation
      program may help to improve the care provided to Asian American cancer patients.This study is
      offered in the following languages in addition to English: Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin)
      and Vietnamese.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify Asian American adults newly diagnosed with colorectal, liver, or lung cancer
      using a population-based cancer registry.

      II. Conduct outreach to these patients to let them know about the availability of information
      on these cancers, the Patient Cancer OUtreach, Navigation, Technology and Support (COUNTS)
      web portal, and the Patient COUNTS patient navigation program.

      III. Provide patient navigation either virtually or in-person.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients attend focus groups to help develop patient portal and navigation program. Patients
      use in-person navigation program. In phase II, patients use an online portal to access
      navigation program and may choose to have online/virtual navigation support or in-person
      navigation support. Patients also complete data collection and surveys over 15 minutes via
      web portal at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months and user experience survey at end of program
      participation.
