  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will compare the absolute volumes of the upper extremity using both the
      LymphaTech Scanner and Perometer in a cohort of patients with a history of invasive or
      in-situ carcinoma of the breast.

      Our trial seeks to assess the efficacy of the LymphaTech Scanner as compared to the
      Perometer, which is currently used to screen for breast cancer-related lymphedema. The focus
      of the study is to compare the absolute volumes of the upper-extremity as measured by each
      device and to compare the time it takes to measure both arms of a patient using each device
      to assess clinical feasibility.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive or in-situ
             carcinoma of the breast and will undergo unilateral breast cancer surgery

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to verbally consent to the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of primary lymphedema.

          -  Any patient with a current case of cellulitis.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Participants unable to abduct upper-extremity perpendicular to body or to stand
             comfortably without aid for several minutes, both of which are necessary to perform a
             LymphaTech Scan
