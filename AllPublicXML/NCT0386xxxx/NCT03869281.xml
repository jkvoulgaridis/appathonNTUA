  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at greater risk of fracture than non-diabetic
      subjects. Although the mechanisms underlying bone fragility in T1D are not completely
      understood, insulin deficiency seems to play a key role.

      To date, no information is available on the effect of diabetes remission after pancreatic
      transplantation alone (PTA) on the risk of fractures in T1D individuals with preserved kidney
      function.

      The overall objective of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the effect of T1D
      remission after PTA on fracture risk.

      The primary endpoint will be the difference in fracture incidence (any fracture) between the
      PTA group and the control group. For the PTA group, the incidence of fractures after
      transplantation will be considered.

      Data from patients who underwent PTA at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital from January 2, 2005 to
      December 31, 2017 will be compared with age-, gender- and disease duration-matched controls
      from the pool of outpatients with T1D attending the Endocrinology Unit at the same
      Institution. Anthropometric, anamnestic, laboratory data and data on the history of fractures
      and past/current therapies will be collected.

      With this study, for the first time we will be able to obtain information on the effects of
      diabetes remission on the risk of fracture. We expect that the remission of diabetes will
      result in a beneficial effect on the fracture risk.

        All patients who underwent their first deceased donor PTA, or second deceased donor PTA if
        their first graft was explanted within a week, at the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital between 2
        January 2005 and 31 December 2017 will be screened for this study. Controls will be
        selected among outpatients with T1D attending the Endocrinology Unit at IRCCS San Raffaele
        Hospital and those listed for a first deceased donor PTA.
