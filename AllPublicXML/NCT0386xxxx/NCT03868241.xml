  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot explanatory, randomized, open label, controlled trial. Critically ill patients which
      will demand placement of invasive devices for organ support (endotracheal tube, central
      venous catheter and urinary Foley catheter) will be randomized 1:1 to receive coated
      (Bactiguard®) or habitual (non-coated) devices.
