    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare postanesthetic agitation in patients
      undergoing laparotomic gynecological surgery under general anesthesia using sevoflurane at a
      fresh gas flow rate of 2 L / min with fresh gas flow rate of 0.5 L / min.

      Emergence agitation is a temporary state of mental anxiety that occurs during general
      anesthesia recovery. It is characterized by emergence agitation, hallucination, excitation,
      delusion and confusion. Increased hemorrhage due to hypertension may cause serious
      complications such as injury to the surgical site, patients' self-removal of surgical drains
      and catheters, and self-extubation. Due to these, emergence agitation results need for
      additional treatment, psychological stress and increased medical workload for patients and
      their families.

      Emergence agitation after general anesthesia in adult patients was reported up to 20%.
      However, the ratios are very wide.

      In our operating room, the investigators observed that patients with low flow anesthesia were
      less agitated in the recovery phase than patients with normal flow anesthesia. In our
      researches, the investigators have not found any studies on the agitation values of patients
      who underwent low flow anesthesia in the literature.

    <description>Emergence agitation is a temporary state of mental anxiety that occurs during general anesthesia recovery. It is characterized by emergence agitation, hallucination, excitation, delusion and confusion.
Emergence agitation is defined as the Riker sedation-agitation scale (SAS) score of 5 or more at any time in the PACU.
Riker sedation-agitation scale:
7 point is 'Dangerous agitation' 6 point is 'very agitated' 5 point is 'agitated' 4 point is 'calm and cooperative' 3 point is 'sedated' 2 point is 'very sedated'
1 point is 'unarousable'</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>postanesthetic nausea and vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after general anesthesia recovery</time_frame>
    <description>The Nausea-Vomiting score will also assess and 4 mg of Ondansetron iv will be administered to those who had a score of 2 or more.
The Nausea-Vomiting score:
0 point: no nausea or vomiting
point: the patient has moderate nausea for less than 15 minutes
point: the patient has nausea for more than 15 minutes
point: the patient has retching or vomiting</description>
