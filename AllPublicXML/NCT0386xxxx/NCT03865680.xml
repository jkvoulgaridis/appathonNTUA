    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous
      calcium phosphate fluoride varnish (CPP-ACP FV) in comparison to fluoride varnish (FV) as a
      remineralizing agent for white spot lesions in primary teeth (WSLs).

    <textblock>
      The study is a two parallel arms double blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. A total
      of 180 WSL in primary teeth in chikdren aged 2-5 y and satisfying the inclusion criteria were
      selected. Patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups allocated to two varnishes: study
      group: CPP-ACP FV (MI varnish), Control group FV (Duraphat). Both fluoride varnishes
      applications are applied with identical intensive protocols every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. The
      application of each varnish will be according to manufacturer's instructions. The operator is
      not blinded to treatment type. Only the participants and statistician are blinded to
      treatment groups. The whole sample (N=180) will be followed up at 6 weeks and at 18 and 30
      weeks for Visio-tactile assessment and DIAGNOdent measurements

    <measure>White spot lesion evaluation using DIAGNOdent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Probe B OF Laser fluorescence (LF) examination for each lesion will be performed using DIAGNOdent. It operates with a diode laser having a wavelength of 655 nm and 1 mW peak power. Sound enamel does not fluoresce at this wavelength, but caries and bacteria do. The instrument is calibrated according to manufacturer's instructions. A baseline zero value for each patient is obtained by choosing a clear non carious patch of enamel usually middle third of an anterior tooth. By pointing the pen perpendicular to this area and touching the set button for 2 seconds until set 0 appears, the button is then released. Zero baseline value has been set. Under cotton roll isolation and after air drying with an air syringe, the DIAGNOdent probe will be placed perpendicular to the test site and rotated along the lesion to scan the area completely. Three measurements of each lesion will be taken and averaged to give the final score.</description>
