    <description>ACT-1004-1239 will be given as a single oral dose under fasting conditions. Eight doses are planned with a starting dose of 1 mg. The ADME characteristics and absolute bioavailability using a 14C-radiolabeled microtracer will be evaluated as part of the SAD, after the first 3 cohorts have been performed.</description>

    <description>ACT-1004-1239 will be available for clinical study use as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration formulated in strengths of 1, 10, and 100 mg. For the ADME subpart, a single oral dose of 1 μCi of 14C radiolabeled ACT-1004-1239 will be given simultaneously with the ACT-1004-1239 capsule. For the absolute bioavailability subpart, a single intravenous dose of a maximum of 1 μCi of 14C radiolabeled ACT-1004-1239 will be given at the expected tmax after the administration of the ACT-1004-1239 capsule.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent in a language understandable to the subject prior to any
             study-mandated procedure.

          -  Healthy male subjects aged between 18 and 55 years (inclusive) at Screening.

          -  No sperm donation from (first) study treatment administration up to at least 90 days
             after (last) study treatment administration.

          -  Sexual abstinence or use of condoms from (first) treatment administration up to at
             least 90 days after (last) study treatment administration. Moreover, the female
             partner of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.

          -  Any previous and/or ongoing relevant immune-related disorder or any evidence for
             immune dysfunction based on medical history and laboratory tests at Screening

          -  Any cardiac condition or illness (including clinically relevant 12-lead ECG
             abnormalities) with a potential to increase the cardiac risk of the subject based on
             medical history and 12-lead ECG measured at Screening.

          -  QT interval corrected with Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 430 ms, respectively, QRS
             interval &gt; 110 ms, PR interval &gt; 200 ms, or heart rate (HR) &gt; 90 bpm on 12-lead ECG at
             Screening and Day 1 pre-dose (of the first period when applicable).

          -  Treatment with another investigational treatment within the 2 months prior to
             Screening or participation in more than 3 investigational treatment studies within the
             year prior to Screening.

          -  History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or
             medical condition that might interfere with the ADME of the study treatment (e.g.,
             appendectomy and herniotomy allowed, cholecystectomy not allowed).

          -  Previous treatment with any prescribed medications (including vaccines and strong
             CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers) or over-the-counter (OTC) medications (including
             homeopathic preparations, herbal medicines, vitamins, and minerals) within the 2 weeks
             or 5 terminal half-lives (t½; whichever is longer) prior to (first) study treatment
             administration.
