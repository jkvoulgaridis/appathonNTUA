  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MED-EL Cochlear Implants (CI) provide auditory sensations via electrical stimulation of the
      auditory pathways for severely to profoundly hearing-impaired individuals who obtain little
      or no benefit from acoustic amplification in the best aided condition. Front-end processing
      of acoustic signals picked up by the audio processor is routinely applied to provide optimal
      hearing performance under varying listening conditions. Automatic Sound Management (ASM) was
      introduced by MED-EL with the TEMPO+ audio processor. With the new SONNET 2 audio processor,
      ASM 3.0 was implemented and the features noise reduction, transient reduction and an
      automatic scene classifier were added. This study will investigate the impact of ASM 3.0 as
      implemented in the SONNET 2 on CI users' speech performance and their subjective quality of
      hearing.
