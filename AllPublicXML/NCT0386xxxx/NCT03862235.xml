  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) abuse may have a toxic on myocardium that could lead to
      cardiac alterations. Clinical cases reported myocardial fibrosis in AAS users. However,
      recent studies did not find myocardial fibrosis in AAS users using T1-mapping technique. The
      aim of this study was to evaluate cardiac structure by cardiovascular magnetic resonance
      (CMR) with late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE), cardiac T1-mapping and extracellular volume
      (ECV). We also evaluated the cardiac contractility in AAS users.

      Twenty strength-trained AAS users (AASU) age 29±5 yr, 20 age-matched strength-trained AAS
      nonusers (AASNU), and 10 sedentary controls (SC) were enrolled.

      Cardiac structure was assessed by LGE, T1-mapping and ECV. Cardiac contractility was
      evaluated as cardiac strain by CMR (feature tracking) and echocardiography (speckle tracking)

    <description>For the identification of microscopic interstitial fibrosis and the calculation of extracellular space volume (ECV) were use the T1-mapping technique, which use the Modified Lock-Locker (MOLLI) pulse sequence. It was performed for image acquisition, before contrast injection with 3 short-axis cuts, in order to define the baseline T1 of myocardium. The evaluation of the MOLLI sequence images at 4 different times has the objective of evaluating the recovery of T1 times after contrast injection, which allows, associated with hematocrit, the calculation of myocardial extracellular space that is directly related to fibrosis in validation studies with endomyocardial biopsy.</description>

    <description>To calculate the left ventricular function, the strain values were used. Using the speckle-tracking technique, the value of the global longitudinal strain (GLS) was extracted through the three apical views, later the mean of 17 myocardial segments was calculated. Normal value for GLS was set to -18%, although in the literature there is no standardized value. Circumferential and radial strain values were estimated by short-axis parasternal views.</description>

    <description>The patients underwent to CMR examination on a Philips Achieve 1.5 device. Images were acquired coupled to the electrocardiogram and during respiratory pause, in four chambers, short axis and long axis of the left ventricle, in the same exact location in different sequences. A gradient - echo sequence (steady-state free precession) was used to evaluate cardiac function (functional evaluation). We will also evaluate T1 weighted images (T1 -relaxation times) and T2, performed sequentially, through spin-echo pulse (black-blood), triple inversion recovery sequence, for the morphological evaluation</description>
