  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that a tailored programme of genetic and imaging screening of
      first- and second-degree relatives of patients affected by non-syndromic forms of thoracic
      aortic diseases will identify individuals at risk of death from these conditions. These
      individuals would constitute specific population of patients, requiring dedicated imaging
      surveillance and/or earlier prophylactic aortic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diseases involving the thoracic aorta (the major artery in the body) are a major health
      problem affecting an increasing number of people worldwide.

      In particular, a group of these conditions termed Non-Syndromic Aortic Diseases (NS-TAD), can
      develop without any obvious symptoms or external features which prevents early
      identification. Unfortunately, if not treated, the aorta may enlarge and lead to dissection,
      a life-threatening medical emergency. For this reason, the investigators believe it might be
      helpful to investigate relatives of patients undergoing surgery for thoracic aortic disease
      to understand if there are tests that could help identify and treat this condition at the
      right time.

      Therefore the investigators propose to conduct a feasibility study to identify the practical
      issues and challenges that would need to be overcome in order to perform a successful
      tailored genetic (by collecting a small blood sample) and imaging (with exams such as
      echocardiography and MRI) screening in such population of individuals.

      Moreover, all participants will receive two questionnaires to ask their opinion about the
      study and to measure their levels of anxiety and depression, to judge whether and how this
      study has affected their emotional status.

      The study will be carried out at the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences Glenfield
      Hospital, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.

    <intervention_model_description>This pilot study will recruit relatives of 16 patients with a diagnosis of non-syndromic thoracic aortic disease. As many FDR and SDR of the proband (index patient) as possible will be recruited into the study (family based analysis). They will be screened through complete clinical evaluations, genetic tests (whole exome sequencing) and imaging modalities (TTE and MRI) for the presence of newly NS-TADs.</intervention_model_description>

Demographic and clinical data from all participants will be collected using case report forms, and by accessing their medical records. Data on imaging investigations will be obtained from TTE and MRI. Blood samples will be used for the purpose of isolation of genetic material and subsequent whole exome sequencing along with the analysis of selected loci. Additional citrated blood samples and plasma will be collected and stored for the potential analysis of circulating microvesicles and miRNA.</description>
