    <textblock>
      This study is designed to enhance the understanding of the possible health effects of
      e-cigarette use by relating the acute and long-term use of e-cigarettes and conventional
      cigarettes (&quot;products&quot;) to well-validated cardiovascular and pulmonary disease biomarkers.
      Participants will be enrolled in 4 groups: exclusive e-cigarette users, exclusive cigarette
      smokers, e-cigarette and cigarette users, and a control group of never-users. Participants
      can expect up to 4 weeks of study participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarette use is increasing rapidly in the United States, especially amongst youth,
      underscoring the vital need to improve understanding of its health risks. Relevant data could
      inform policy, guide public health and clinical intervention efforts, and inform individuals
      who might use or who are using this product. This research will significantly enhance the
      understanding of the possible health effects of e-cigarette use by relating the acute and
      long-term use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes (&quot;products&quot;) to well-validated
      cardiovascular and pulmonary disease biomarkers. 3 different &quot;use-groups&quot; of participants
      will be enrolled: exclusive e-cigarette users (n=110), exclusive cigarette smokers (n=110),
      dual product users (who both smoke and vape: n=110) and a &quot;control&quot; group of never-users
      (n=110). These groups reflect the primary decisions that people can make regarding their
      future tobacco use: to continue to smoke cigarettes, to switch to e-cigarettes, to use both
      cigarettes and e-cigarettes, or to avoid tobacco use entirely. It is essential that smokers
      and health care providers have accurate information on the health effect of these choices.

      Product use will be related to well-validated biomarkers that sensitively and reproducibly
      reflect mechanisms, injury, and/or future risk related to cardiovascular or pulmonary
      disease. Biomarkers will be related to: 1) acute product use in the laboratory (exposure
      challenges), 2) lifetime history of product use, and/or 3) real-time measures of product use
      in participants' daily lives. The primary cardiovascular biomarkers are brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation (a measure of endothelial function) and carotid intima-media
      thickness, a measure of subclinical arterial injury and atherosclerosis. The primary
      pulmonary disease biomarkers will be measures of lung volumes and flow rates (FEV1, FVC,
      FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75) obtained by spirometry. Treadmill exercise stress testing will be
      performed (to assess aerobic fitness), electrocardiography (to measure heart rate
      variability, HRV), and measure heart rate, blood pressure, lipids, HgbA1c, and
      inflammation/oxidation markers (leukocyte count, C-reactive protein, urinary F2 isoprostanes
      and exhaled nitric oxide). This research will show how product use-groups differ in response
      to acute product use and long-term use as they are related to key cardiovascular and
      pulmonary biomarkers. Objective measures of product use include exhaled CO and plasma
      nicotine/cotinine and urinary nicotine/cotinine concentrations. History of product use within
      use-groups will be related to biomarker status.

      The proposed research will yield vital and comprehensive data regarding product use,
      subclinical arterial injury, atherosclerosis burden, arterial and pulmonary function, cardiac
      and aerobic fitness, cardiac autonomic regulation, systemic and pulmonary inflammation, and
      oxidative stress, as well as other key outcomes. These data will serve as a foundation for
      future longitudinal investigations of e-cigarette health effects and will inform public
      policy decisions, clinical intervention, and patient guidance regarding e-cigarettes.

    <ipd_description>Our specific plan begins with the creation of a data archive with coded information in computer-readable form for distribution to the scientific community using the procedures outlined below. The information will include a codebook containing definitions of variables, variable field locations, summary statistics and any standard scoring information. Final data sets will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing (the release of a limited data set containing one or more specific identifiers would be considered if absolutely required by the researcher and if the request meets all UW, IRB and OHRP policies). We will make the final de-identified study dataset available by request from other researchers in a timely manner (in accord with NHLBI policy). We will make all key variables available via posting of final data codebook and dataset in suitable archives. All shared variables and datasets will be de-identified and approved for sharing by the UW IRB.</ipd_description>
