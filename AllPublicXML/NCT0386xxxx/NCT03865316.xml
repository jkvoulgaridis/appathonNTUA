  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the performance of Masimo's SedLine and the comparator's
      device systems during surgery. Relative accuracy of the individual depth of sedation indices
      will be compared.

      Monitoring vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature),
      respiratory, and anesthesia parameters is considered standard for managing patients during
      anesthesia. However, the end target organ of action for anesthetic agents (the brain) is not
      routinely monitored. Processed EEG-based monitor index such as Patient State Index (PSIâ„¢)
      have been shown to be useful in assessing brain activity during sedation and general
      anesthesia. Due to the absence of an invasive gold standard to measure sedation, accuracy of
      any sedation index cannot be computed. However, correlation with the anesthesia drugs or
      sedation scales are generally used to determine the performance of the sedation index.
