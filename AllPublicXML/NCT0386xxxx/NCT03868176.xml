  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of Short Message Service (SMS) on compliance with
      surveillance of patients with germ-cell tumors. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
      get 2 groups : (1) patients will receive reminder SMS before appointment detailing the date
      of consultation and exams to be performed before; (2) standard of care without SMS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of patients who report optimal compliance to surveillance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Optimal compliance is defined according to the following 2 parameters:
The patient comes to all the appointments, on the expected day, AND
With all the biological and imaging exams previously scheduled by the physician.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of patients who report intermediate compliance to surveillance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Intermediate compliance is defined according to the following 2 parameters:
The patient comes to all the appointments, but in one of the consultations, he delays his scheduled appointment of more than 3 weeks but less than 6 weeks OR
Missing a biological or imaging exam.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of patients who report a non compliance to surveillance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Non compliance is defined according to the following 3 parameters:
The patient misses a consultation, without warning, OR
He delays of more than 6 weeks his appointment of consultation, OR
At least 2 biological or imaging exams requested by the oncologist are missing from all consultations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction of sending SMS, in experimental arm</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It is evaluated with the following question: do you find that having reminder sms for your appointments and exams is useful? evaluated on a scale of 0 to 10 (0: useless, 10: useful)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>biological recurrence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Biological recurrence rate is defined by the increase in tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein, lactic dehydrogenase, human chorionic gonadotropin).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological recurrence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Radiological recurrence rate is defined according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1.</description>
