  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a laboratory-based investigation of the behavioral and neural effects of
      intranasal oxytocin on craving for alcohol and approach bias in moderate to heavy alcohol
      using subjects. This study uses a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      counterbalanced, crossover design to compare the effects oxytocin and placebo. In this way,
      all subjects will be scanned twice; once following oxytocin administration and once following
      placebo administration, and will complete a series of behavioral tasks (both in and out of
      the scanner) at both visits.

    <measure>Alcohol cue craving score</measure>
    <time_frame>~ 90 minutes post study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to perform a standardized alcohol cue exposure paradigm and be asked to rate their subjective craving following alcohol cue presentation using a standard visual analog scale. Craving scores (ranging from 1-10 on VAS) will be compared across both the active study drug and placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>~ 90 minutes post study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to perform an image approach task where subjects are presented with a series of images and asked to pull or push a joystick following each presentation. Response direction and speed are recorded and compared across both the active study drug and placebo.</description>
