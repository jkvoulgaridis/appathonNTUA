  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, phase I/IIa, dose-escalation study, involving a single
      injection of Temferon, an investigational advanced therapy consisting of autologous
      CD34+-enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells exposed to transduction with a
      lentiviral vector driving myeloid specific interferon-alpha2 expression, which will be
      administered to up to 21 patients affected by GBM who have an unmethylated MGMT promoter.
      Part A will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 escalating doses of Temferon in up to 9
      patients, following first line treatment. In Part B, a further 12 patients will receive a
      single dose of Temferon, as idenitifed from Part A.

      This is a non-randomized, open label, two center, phase I/IIa, therapeutic-exploratory, dose
      escalation, prospective study, involving a single injection of Temferon, an investigational
      ATMP consisting of autologous CD34+-enriched HSPCs exposed to transduction with a 3rd
      generation lentiviral vector driving myeloid-specific IFN-alpha2 expression, which will be
      administered to up to 21 patients affected by GBM who have an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The
      study will recruit and follow-up patients at a specialist neurosurgical and neuro-oncology
      unit (Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, INCB) in Milan, Italy. Administration of Temferon and
      hematological follow up will take place at a specialist hematology and bone marrow
      transplantation unit at Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR) in Milan, Italy.

      Potentially eligible patients will be identified at INCB immediately after surgical resection
      of GBM once the MGMT promoter methylator status is known. Once written, informed consent is
      obtained, and screening procedures have been completed, harvesting of HSPCs will occur at
      OSR. A standard of care regimen lasting approximately 6 weeks, will then take place at INCB.
      During this time, Temferon manufacturing will occur. Following completion of radiotherapy,
      patients will be admitted to OSR for receipt of a conditioning regimen consisting of BCNU and
      thiotepa. This will be followed by administration of Temferon. In-patient monitoring at OSR
      will occur until hematological recovery occurs. Thereafter, regular follow-up of patients
      will occur up to 2 years (+720 days) with the majority of assessments and procedures
      performed at INCB and some assessments/procedures at OSR. At the +720 day visit, patients
      will be invited to participate in a long term follow-up study which will last for an
      additional 6 years.

      In Part A of the study, 3 cohorts of 3 patients will receive escalating doses of Temferon. On
      completion of Part A, a single dose of Temferon will be selected to be studied in up to a
      further 12 patients in Part B. Criteria for study eligibility are the same for both Part A
      and Part B.

      In the event that GBM disease progression occurs, patients will be managed with second line
      therapies including second surgery, TMZ, BCNU, fotemustine or any other approved therapy for
      GBM.

    <description>Autologous CD34+-enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells exposed in vitro to specific lentiviral vector encoding for the human interferon-alpha 2 gene. Its expression is tightly controlled by the human TIE2 enhancer/promoter sequence and by a post-transcriptional regulation layer represented by target miRNA sequences. This enables suppression of interferon-alpha2 expression in HSPCs, thereby further increasing the specificity of the delivery strategy for their Tie2 expressing myeloid cell progeny.</description>
