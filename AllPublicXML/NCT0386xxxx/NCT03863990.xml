    <textblock>
      In this study researchers want to learn more about Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, a type of
      high blood pressure in the lungs related to the narrowing of the small blood vessels in the
      lungs (group 1 according to WHO classification). Goal of the study is to describe the signs
      and risk factors of the illness at study start and the chances of survival.

      The primary objective of the study is to describe baseline clinical characteristics and
      overall survival in a cohort of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) of WHO
      functional class I in Argentina.

      Secondary objectives are to study the discriminatory ability of the risk assessment tool
      presented in the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS)
      2015 guidelines and to explore the potential prognostic advantage of a low-risk profile at
      follow-up as treatment goal.
