  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning among patients with cognitive disorders poses unique challenges to
      clinicians. To improve planning in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, the
      researchers suggest a routine, standardized approach to these conversations. The main outcome
      measure is the rate of entry of Advance Directive completion in the patient's Electronic
      Health Record (EHR). A control group of similar patients from another provider specializing
      in cognitive disorders will be used to tease out confounding variable effects.
