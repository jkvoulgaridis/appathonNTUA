  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Canadian, multi-centre, prospective, real world study is designed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of low dose methoxyflurane (MEOF) (PENTHROX™) for the treatment of moderate to
      severe pain associated with trauma in the Canadian ED.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the change in pain intensity over 20 minutes from start of
      administration of PENTHROX™ and will generate Real World Evidence in support of existing
      clinical trial data including effectiveness, safety and additional parameters of low dose
      MEOF (PENTHROX™) in Canadian EDs.

    <measure>Change in mean pain intensity: Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>20 mins from start of administration (STA) of PENTHROX™</time_frame>
    <description>The level of pain intensity will be collected by means of the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The NRS is considered a reliable and valid scale for assessing pain intensity and is preferred by patients for its simplicity. In this 11-point scale, the end points are the extremes of no pain and pain as bad as it could be, or worst pain (i.e. a score of 0 = no pain and a score of 10 = worst pain possible).
Assessed by the patient 20 mins post PENTHROX™ inhalation</description>

    <measure>Speed of action of analgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>At any point from STA of PENTHROX™ to 20 mins post inhalation</time_frame>
    <description>Speed of action of analgesia is defined as the time at which the patient experiences meaningful pain relief following inhalation of PENTHROX™.
The healthcare professional will instruct the patient to note the time at which they experience meaningful pain relief. The time point will be recorded in the case report form.</description>

    <description>Global medication performance (GMP) is an assessment of the health care professional's and patient's impression of how well a medication works.
Global Medication Performance (GMP)-is a patient and health care provider reported outcome with the objective of assessing the health care professional's and patient's impression of how well a medication works.
GMP is measured by asking the patient and health care professional a single question: &quot;rate the pain relief provided by PENTHROX™&quot; utilizing a 5-point Likert scale where 1=Poor- 5=Excellent</description>

    <description>Fulfillment of pain relief expectations- is a patient and health care professional reported outcome with the objective of assessing the health care professional's and patient's impression of how well a medication fulfilled their expectations.
Fulfillment of pain relief expectations is measured by asking the patient and health care professional a single question: &quot;To what extent has your expectations regarding pain control been met&quot; and utilizing a 5-point Likert scale where 1=Poor- 5=Excellent.</description>

    <description>As soon as possible following enrollment and initial procedures, the patient will be supplied with a PENTHROX™ kit which includes one inhaler containing 3 mL of MEOF for pain management. A member of the research team will train the patient to self-administer MEOF. PENTHROX™ is an approved (trademarked) product in Canada and is commercially available in a combination blister pack with one 3 mL sealed bottle and one PENTHROX™ inhaler with the Activated Carbon (AC) chamber.</description>
