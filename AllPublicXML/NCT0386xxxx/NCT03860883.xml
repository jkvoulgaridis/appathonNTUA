  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a primary invasive melanoma are recommended to undergo excision of the primary
      lesion with a wide margin. There is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be
      just as safe. This is a randomised controlled trial of 1 cm versus 2 cm margin of excision of
      the primary lesion for adult patients with stage II primary invasive cutaneous melanomas
      (AJCC 8th edition) to determine differences in disease-free survival. A reduction in margins
      is expected to improve patient quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether there is a difference in disease-free survival rates for
      patients with primary cutaneous melanoma with Breslow thickness &gt; 2mm or 1-2mm with
      ulceration (pT2b-pT4b, AJCC 8th edition), treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm
      margin. The study is designed to be able to prove or disprove that there is no difference in
      risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or anywhere else in the body between the two
      groups of patients. If the study shows no risk of tumour recurrence then we will also be able
      to determine how much of an impact the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved
      quality of life and reduced side effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial
      will also evaluate and determine the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the
      health services and society in general.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a treatment which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the treatment timing, whether or not considered related to the treatment. An AE is any adverse change (developing or worsening) from the participant's pre-treatment condition, including intercurrent illness.</description>

             histopathological analysis.

          2. Must have a primary melanoma that is cutaneous (including head, neck, trunk,
             extremity, scalp, palm, or sole).

          3. An uninterrupted 2cm margin must be technically feasible around biopsy scar or primary
             melanoma.

          4. Randomisation and the primary study intervention, including staging sentinel node
             biopsy, must be completed within 120 days of the original diagnosis.

          5. Patients must be 18 years or older at time of consent.

          6. Patient must be able to give informed consent and comply with the treatment protocol
             and follow-up plan.

          7. Life expectancy of at least 5 years from the time of diagnosis, not considering the
             melanoma in question, as determined by the PI.

               -  There has been no evidence of recurrence of any prior malignancies for at least
                  FIVE years (except for successfully treated cervical or non-melanoma skin cancer
                  with no evidence of recurrence), and

               -  The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk of recurrence
                  from previous malignancies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncertain diagnosis of melanoma i.e. so-called 'melanocytic lesion of unknown

             regional, or distant metastatic melanoma.

         11. Patient has undergone surgery on a separate occasion to clear the lymph nodes of the
             probable draining lymphatic field, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, of the index
             melanoma.

         12. Any additional solid tumour or hematologic malignancy during the past 5 years except
             T1 skin lesions of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or uterine/cervical
             cancer.

         13. Melanoma-related operative procedures not corresponding to criteria described in the
             protocol.

         14. Planned adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary melanoma site after Wide Local Excision
             is not permitted as part of the protocol and any patients given this treatment would
             be excluded from the study.

         15. History of organ transplantation.

         16. Oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents (not topical or inhaled steroids) at any
             time during study participation or within 6 months prior to enrolment.
