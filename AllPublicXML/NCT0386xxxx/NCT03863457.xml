  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with known or suspected primary or metastatic breast cancer with one lesion that is
      1.5 cm in diameter or greater may be eligible for this study. Patients may participate in
      this study if they are at least 18 years of age. Up to 30 evaluable subjects will participate
      in a single imaging cohort. Patients will be stratified by breast cancer subtype with
      prioritization to recruit at least 10 estrogen-receptor-expressing (ER+) and 10
      triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).

      This is an observational study; [18F]F-GLN PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment
      decisions. While patients and referring physicians will not be blinded to the [18F]F-GLN
      PET/CT results, treatment decisions are made by the treating physicians based upon clinical
      criteria.

      [18F]F-GLN PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of [18F]F-GLN. Metabolism data
      will be collected. Pilot data will be collected to evaluate image quality and collect
      preliminary information on the uptake of [18F]F-GLN in breast cancer. Uptake measures will be
      compared to tumor markers of glutamine metabolism, when tissue is available. The safety of
      [18F]F-GLN will also be evaluated in all subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 patients will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic PET scanning followed by
      up to 2 static skull-base to mid-thigh scans post injection of [18F] (2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine
      ([18F]F-GLN). A baseline FDG-PET/CT will also be performed, either as a routine clinical
      staging/re-staging scan or as a research scan. If performed as a research scan, the scan may
      include an optional dynamic imaging session. Some subjects, who undergo systemic therapy as
      part of their clinical treatment, may also undergo an optional second [18F]F-GLN PET/CT to
      collect pilot data on the changes in [18F]F-GLN uptake in response to therapy. Subjects who
      undergo a second [18F]F-GLN PET/CT may have a second FDG-PET/CT, again either as a
      standard-of-care restaging study or as an optional research scan. The timing of the optional
      second PET scans will vary depending on the type of treatment the subject is receiving.

             lesion.
