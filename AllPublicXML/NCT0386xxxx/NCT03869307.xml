  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) is a recent diagnosis that covers generalised joint
      hypermobility with one or more secondary symptomatic musculoskeletal manifestations. Current
      clinical management of this population with shoulder symptoms is based on limited evidence
      and includes a combination of non-specific physiotherapy modalities and exercise
      prescription. There is some evidence suggesting that strength training may be valuable for
      treatment of this patient-group. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a heavy shoulder strengthening exercise programme in patients with HSD and
      shoulder symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) is a recent diagnosis that covers generalised joint
      hypermobility with one or more secondary symptomatic musculoskeletal manifestations such as
      chronic shoulder pain and shoulder instability. The evidence for treatment is sparse, but
      current clinical management of this patient-group with persistent shoulder symptoms is a
      combination of non-specific physiotherapy modalities and exercise prescription. There is some
      evidence suggesting that strength training may be valuable for treatment of this
      patient-group. The intervention consisting of heavy shoulder strengthening exercises has
      recently been tested to be feasible, and since clinical improvements were seen, the
      intervention is ready to be studied in a randomised controlled trial. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a heavy shoulder strengthening exercise
      programme and general advice as compared to shoulder stability exercises and general advice
      (current standard care) in patients with HSD and persistent shoulder symptoms. The primary
      hypothesis is that a heavy shoulder strengthening exercise programme is superior to standard
      care.

      Sample size considerations: a clinically significant effect of 252 points or more out of 2100
      points (SD = 350 points) between the two groups over the 16 weeks is desired, which with a
      two-sided significance of 0.05, a power of 0.9, and 16% dropout, requires a total of 100
      patients. In case 100 patients are not included within 24 months, a stopping rule will be
      applied as soon as at least 76 patients are included, corresponding to a power of minimum
      0.8.

    <measure>Change in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) questionnaire total score</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario Stability Index questionnaire (WOSI) is a tool designed for self-assessment of shoulder function for patients with instability problems.
This questionnaire has 21 questions, each scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 being the best score (no limitations related to the shoulder) and 100 representing the worst score. Overall, the questionnaire is scored from 0-2100 points (better to worse).
There are subscale components reporting on: physical symptoms (questions 1 through 10; maximum score of 1000); sports/recreation/work (questions 11 through 14; maximum score 400); lifestyle (questions 15 through 18; maximum score 400); and emotion (questions 19-21; maximum score 300).
Subscale scores are added to determine the total score out of a possible 2100 points, with 2100 representing the worst possible score.</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L measures change in health related quality of life and includes the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, Self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is rated using a five-level ordinal scale from no problems to extreme problems. It results in a preference based index that range from states worse than death (&lt;0), to 1 (full health), anchoring dead at 0. A score of one indicates that the participants perceived their health at the best possible state and a score below null that the participants perceived their health worse than death.
The EQ VAS measures change in health related quality of life. It includes a visual analogue scale where own health `today´ is rated on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is administered verbally and used to evaluate whether a health condition impacts a patient's ability to perform activities that are important to him/her. On the initial assessment, the patient is asked to identify up to three important activities that are unable to do or are having difficulty with as a result of symptoms.&quot; The patient then provides a rating for each item, on an 11-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (&quot;unable to perform activity&quot;) to 10 (&quot;able to perform activity at the same level as before the injury or problem&quot;). During reassessments, the patient is prompted to re-rate the same activities. The average of up to 3 specific activity scores is recorded, and the range of possible scores is 0 - 10. Higher scores indicate less impairment.</description>
