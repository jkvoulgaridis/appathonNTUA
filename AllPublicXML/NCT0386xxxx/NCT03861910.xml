  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a common chronic condition in childhood. Recent studies have suggested that
      the natural history of food allergy has changed during the last two decades, with an
      increased prevalence, severity of clinical manifestations, and risk of persistence into later
      ages. The increased food allergy prevalence in children has an important economic impact,
      with significant direct costs for the healthcare system and even larger costs for the
      families of food-allergic patients. In addition, children with food allergies are at
      increased risk to develop other allergic manifestations later in life. According to a recent
      study, children with a food allergy are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop other atopic
      manifestations such as asthma (4.0 times), atopic eczema (2.4 times), and respiratory
      allergies (3.6 times), compared to children without a food allergy. Cow's milk allergy is
      among the most common food allergy in early childhood, with an estimated prevalence of 2% to
      3%. It has been previously showed that in children with cow milk allergy, an extensively
      hydrolysed casein formula supplemented with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG induced
      higher tolerance rates compared to extensively hydrolysed casein formula without
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and other formulas. These findings were consistent with those of a
      1-year follow-up study performed in the US that showed better outcomes using an extensively
      hydrolysed casein formula+Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG vs. an extensively hydrolysed casein
      formula or amino acid-based formula for the first-line dietary management of cow milk
      allergy. In addition it has been recently demonstrated that extensively hydrolysed casein
      formula + Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG reduces the incidence of other atopic manifestations and
      hastens the development of oral tolerance in children with IgE-mediated cow milk allergy.

      The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed to test whether different dietary
      interventions could influence the occurrence of other atopic manifestations in children with
      IgE-mediated cow milk allergy.

        Children who were consecutively observed at a FP office because the recent occurrence of
        signs and symptoms possibly related to IgE-mediated CMA were sent to our tertiary centre
        for paediatric allergy for possible inclusion in the study. Only subjects who met the
        inclusion criteria will be invited to participate to the study.Written informed consent
        will be obtained from the parents of each subject. Anamnestic, demographic, anthropometric
        and clinical data, as well as information on socio-demographic factors, family and living
        conditions, parental history of allergic diseases, maternal smoking during pregnancy,
        environmental tobacco smoke exposure, number of siblings, and pet ownership were obtained
        from the parents and recorded in a clinical database. For children with sure diagnosis of
        IgE-mediated CMA during a 3-year follow-up,3 visits every 12 months will be performed.
        Stool samples for metagenomics and metabolomics and blood sample for epigenetics studies
        will be collected.
