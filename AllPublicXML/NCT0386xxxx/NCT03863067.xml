  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It will be done a prospective Study involving 38 patients with lumbar stenosis. A magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging study and a electromyographic study will be done previously and 3
      months after the epiduroscopy to confirm radiologic or neurophysiological changes.

      During the technic it will be used different instruments, an endoscope developed for its use
      in the epidural space (Resascope), a Fogarty balloon (Resaloon) to dilate the space near the
      epidural recess where it will be try to decrease the ligamentum flavum using the Resaflex, an
      instrument with Quantum Molecular Resonance for tissue coablation, in order to get less
      symptomatic lumbar stenosis.

      The investigators will compare qualitative and quantitative variables at baseline and 1, 3,
      6, ant 12 months after the epiduroscopy.

      The investigators perform the Interventional Endoscopic Spinal Surgical (IESS) ,with the
      different instruments mentioned above. The Resaflex wich use Quantum Molecular Resonance,
      through combination of different frequencies in the range of the radio-frequency, emit
      quantum in resonance and produce lesion and coagulation; The objective is to reach the
      ligamentum flavum doing lesions to diminish the stenosis caused by hypertrophic ligamentum
      over all in the recess area near the radicular nerve.

      To increase the security of the procedure the investigators introduce for the first time ,
      neurophysiological monitoring.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Low back pain disability questionnaire: is a validated, 10-point patient-reported outcome questionnaire. It is considered the 'gold standard' for measuring disability and quality of life (QoL) impairment for adults with low back pain (LBP).The 10 factors which constitute the ODI criteria for assessing patients' functional impairment are pain intensity, ease of personal care, lifting, working, sitting, stand-ing, sleeping, sex life, social life and travelling. Each of the 10 questions is scored from 0 to 5, giving a maximum score of 50. The total score is then converted into a percentage by multiplying it by 2. Scores are stratified into severity: 0-20, minimal disability; 21-40, moderate disability; 41-60, severe disability; 61-80, crippling back pain; 81-100, these patients are either bed-bound or have an exaggeration of their symptoms. In order for the results to be deemed clinically significant, a change in the patient's score of 10% or more is required</description>
