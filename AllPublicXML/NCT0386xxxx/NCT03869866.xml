      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To describe the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by
           serum bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA) before and after a single
           dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine

        -  To describe the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y measured by
           serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) before and after a single dose of
           MenACYW conjugate vaccine

        -  To describe the antibody responses against tetanus toxoid at baseline and after a single
           dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine

        -  To describe the safety profile of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine

             the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first
