      This study is a Interventional study. The target group was 3-18 years old, and the
      pathological stage was group II-IV recurrence or distant metastasis. A total of 48 patients
      were enrolled in this study. The treatment was radiotherapy combined with apatinib. The main
      outcome measures were ORR, DCR , OS , quality of life and drug safety. The main safety
      indicators were vital signs, laboratory indicators, adverse events (AE), and severe adverse
      events (SAE). This study is expected to be enrolled for 6 months.

    <intervention_model_description>Simons two-stage design method requires the enrollment of 13 patients in the first stage. If more than 7 patients fail to reach the expected end point, the first stage fails and the patients do not need to enter the second stage. A total of 48 patients were enrolled. If more than 30 patients did not reach the expected end point, the overall trial failed.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain extent and maintained for a certain period of time, including CR and PR cases. Objective remission of solid tumors was assessed by RECIST 1.1. Subjects must be accompanied by measurable tumor lesions at baseline.

EORTC qlq-c30 (V3.0) is the core scale for all cancer patients, with a total of 30 items. Items 29 and 30 are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 according to their answer choices. The other items are divided into four levels: totally not, a little bit, a lot and very much, and are scored on a scale of 1 to 4.
The higher the score of functional domain and general health domain, the better the functional status and quality of life. The higher the score of symptom domain, the more symptoms or problems (the worse the quality of life).</description>

    <description>All eligible patients signed informed consent. Three-dimensional conformal intensity modulation (IMRT) technique was used to treat the patients with radiation doses 45 Gy - 54 Gy. All patients took apatinib mesylate tablets 250 mg QD orally from 1 week before radiotherapy to the whole radiotherapy period. They were required to take apatinib mesylate tablets with warm boiling water half an hour after meal. The daily medication time should be as consistent as possible.</description>
