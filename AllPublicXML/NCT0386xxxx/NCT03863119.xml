  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol is to provide continued access to vamorolone for subjects in the
      United States who Have Completed the VBP15-LTE or VBP15- 004 protocols (and are thereby
      ineligible to enroll in another trial of vamorolone therapy), during the time a new drug
      application for vamorolone is under preparation and review
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vamorolone will be shipped to the subject's family by the study site. The patient will
      receive standard of care treatment and procedures for management of DMD. Treating Physicians
      participating in the expanded access program are required to collect and document any
      physician, patient, or caregiver reported safety events and report to the Sponsor. The
      subject's dose of vamorolone may be increased or decreased within a range of 2.0 to 6.0
      mg/kg/day (only doses of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg are allowed), given once daily.
      Administration of vamorolone (taken with an 8 ounce (240 ml) glass of full fat milk, or
      equivalent high-fat food portion) will be unchanged from the VBP15-LTE or VBP15-004 studies.
      In the absence of safety concerns, and while this Expaneded Access protocol is active,
      vamorolone may be provided indefinitely or until approval, provided that the Treating
      Physician and family agrees that continued administration of vamorolone is in the best
      interest of the child

          -  Subject has previously completed at a participating US study site VBP15-LTE up to and
             including the Month 24 assessments, OR VBP15-004 up to and including the Week 48
             assessments, within 30 days prior to participation in the VBP15-EAP

          -  Subject and parent/guardian are willing and able to comply with recommended study drug
