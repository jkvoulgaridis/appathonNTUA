  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistance is a major challenge for tuberculosis (TB) care programs. The new WHO
      guideline recommends adding levofloxacin in previously treated patients with
      isoniazid-resistant rifampicin-susceptible TB. The investigators believe that such a
      retreatment regimen may result in acquired resistance to fluoroquinolone, the core drug of
      multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) regimen, and thus threaten the effectiveness of the
      fluoroquinolone-based MDR-TB treatment regimen. Therefore the investigators propose to study
      if regimens strengthened by using high-dose first-line drugs, either a triple dose of
      isoniazid or a triple dose of rifampicin, are non-inferior to the WHO recommended
      levofloxacin-strengthened regimen. If one of both high-dose regimens would be non-inferior,
      it could replace the levofloxacin-strengthened regimen.
