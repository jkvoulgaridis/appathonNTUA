  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupilumab has recently demonstrated high efficacy and good safety profile in the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. There is a crucial need of developing new treatment
      options in Chronic hand eczema refractory to topical therapy. Investigators hypothesise that
      Dupilumab will also have high efficacy and good safety profile in the treatment of moderate
      to severe Chronic hand eczema refractory to highly potent topical corticosteroids.

    <textblock>
      Chronic hand eczema is a frequent chronic inflammatory skin disease which may have
      significant physical, psychological and social impact on daily activities, emotional and
      social life as well as work. In Chronic hand eczema, there is a close relationship between
      atopic dermatitis (that involves 70% of patients), sensitization to environmental antigens
      and irritant triggering factors. There are limited treatment options for Chronic hand eczema
      refractory to highly potent topical steroids. The only systemic treatment labelled in Chronic
      hand eczema, alitretinoin, is associated with moderate efficacy, high drop-out due to adverse
      events and it requires strict contraception measures in women of child bearing potential.
      Dupilumab has recently demonstrated high efficacy and good safety profile in the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. There is a crucial need of developing new treatment
      options in Chronic hand eczema refractory to topical therapy. the investigators hypothesise
      that Dupilumab will also have high efficacy and good safety profile in the treatment of
      moderate to severe Chronic hand eczema refractory to highly potent topical corticosteroids.

    <measure>severity score mTLSS (modified Total Lesion Symptom Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the 16-week percent change since baseline of the severity score mTLSS (modified Total Lesion Symptom Score) The mTLSS combines an evaluation of hand eczema lesions severity including 6 key signs (erythema, desquamation, lichenification/hyperkeratosis, vesiculae, oedema, fissures) and the intensity of pruritus and pain.
The seven individual CHE symptoms; (erythema, scaling, lichenification or hyperkeratosis, vesiculation, edema, fissures, and pruritus/pain) form the composite scale of mTLSS' strength and each one of them scores from 0 (mild) to 3 (severe). The scores are summed, extending from a base estimation of 0 (no signs or symptoms) to the most extreme of 21 (more serious disease).</description>

    <measure>Improvement of quality of life by EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of quality of life at week 16 since baseline measured by EQ-5D-5L. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descriptive system of the respondent's health and a rating of his or her current health state using a 0 to 100 mm VAS. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his or her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box associated with the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labeled &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state.&quot; This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome.</description>

The WPAI consists of 6 items grouped into 4 domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
