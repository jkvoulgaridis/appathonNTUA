      Methods: Prospective observational study in adult patients requiring preoperative evaluation

      Objectives: To determine the correlation between the aortic pulse wave velocity (AoPWV) and
      the distance walked in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) Sample Size: For a desired precision of
      estimate of ± 0.10 (95% confidence interval) around a postulated validity correlation
      coefficient of r = 0.70 (for an AoPWV in the distance prediction of 6MWT) a sample of 100
      patients. By allowing a 25% wear rate, a final sample size of 125 participants is required
      Inclusion criteria: Patients older than 18 years undergoing any surgery and who require
      pre-anesthesia Statistical analysis If the variables have a normal distribution, the Pearson
      correlation coefficient (r2) is used, which is between -1 and 1. Where -1 indicates the
      highest possible negative linear relationship (increasing the value of a variable decreases
      the another), 0 that there is no association, +1 positive correlation. From 0.7 negative or
      positive, it is said that the association is strong.

      Linear regression models of ordinary least squares will be applied to obtain the validity
      coefficient (r) and the standard error of the estimate (SEE): the typical error associated
      with the prediction the AoPWV with the distance traveled in the 6MWD test in each individual
      patient. The analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) will be used to
      derive cutoff points for an AoPWV value for the prediction of a 6MWD less than 427 meters

    <description>This test is performed routinely in the pre-rehabilitation units or in external anesthesiology consultations during the preoperative visit. In essence, it consists in measuring the maximum distance the patient is able to walk in 6 minutes, in a short walk in a corridor, simultaneously assessing the heart rate, oxygen saturation and the degree of dyspnea. In general, healthy people can walk between 400 and 700 meters in 6 minutes, depending on age, height and sex.</description>
