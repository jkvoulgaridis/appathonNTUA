  <brief_summary>

      Background and rationale: A large multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrated that
      in patients with hypoxemic non-hypercapnic respiratory failure treatment with nasal high flow
      oxygen (NHF) resulted in a reduction of the endotracheal intubation rate (38%) compared with
      noninvasive ventilation (NIV) delivered by facemask (50%) or with conventional oxygen therapy
      (47%), although the difference was not statistically significant. These results could be
      potentially explained by the physiological benefits provided by the NHF. However, one of the
      surprising findings of this study was that patients randomized to the facemask NIV group had
      a similar or even poorer outcome than oxygen alone. Interestingly, an observational study
      showed that in patients receiving facemask NIV for acute hypoxemia delivered tidal volumes
      were higher than expected (8.1-11.1 ml/kg predicted body weight), suggesting that NIV could
      potentially cause ventilator-induced lung injury resulting in worsening respiratory failure.

      We, therefore, plan a crossover physiologic study investigating the hypothesis that compared
      with NIV the treatment with NHF of patients with acute hypoxemic non-hypercapnic respiratory
      failure results in a more homogeneous distribution of tidal volume, and hence less
      ventilator-induced lung injury, as measured by electrical impedance tomography (EIT).

      Methods: This physiologic study will enroll 20 patients from the ICU at Toronto General
      Hospital in one year. Adult patients with acute hypoxemic non cardiogenic respiratory failure
      and PaO2:FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg, respiratory rate &gt; 25 breaths/minute, PaCO2 ≤ 45 mmHg and absence
      of clinical history of underlying chronic respiratory failure will be eligible. Patients that
      received invasive mechanical ventilation for &gt; 48 hours in the same hospital admission,
      requiring immediate intubation, with hemodynamic instability (systolic arterial pressure &lt; 90
      mmHg after optimal fluid therapy), with Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 12, or contraindications to
      noninvasive ventilation and tracheostomy, will be excluded. After baseline assessment while
      receiving oxygen through facemask or nasal prongs, patients will receive in randomly assigned
      order NHF for 20 minutes and NIV for 20 minutes, in a crossover manner. EIT recordings,
      diaphragm ultrasound, and collection of blood samples for arterial blood gases will be
      performed at the end of each phase.

      Data analysis: The primary endpoint is the comparison of the EIT intra-tidal ventilation
      index between treatment with NHF and NIV. As secondary endpoints, we will determine whether
      NHF, in comparison to NIV, provides respiratory support with lower global inhomogeneity index
      (EIT), lower tidal volumes, reduces respiratory muscle effort (respiratory rate and
      diaphragmatic ultrasound), and improves gas exchange (oxygen saturation, PaO2:FiO2, PaCO2,
      RR).
