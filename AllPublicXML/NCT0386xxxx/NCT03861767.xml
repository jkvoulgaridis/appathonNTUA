  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of various interventions to improve
      patient outcome as defined by hospital free days at day 90 for adult patients undergoing
      elective surgery. Within this project, multiple studies may be conducted.

      The structure of this project permits:

        -  the testing of multiple treatments at the same time within the same patient

        -  the use of early study results to provide better treatment options to future patients

        -  the removal of treatments which are shown to be less effective than the other treatments

        -  the addition of new treatments

      The first study to be conducted under this project (IRB STUDY19090186) is the Strategies to
      Promote ResiliencY (SPRY) clinical trial (IRB PRO18060038).

      The SPRY clinical trial will determine the effectiveness of Metformin on improving surgical
      outcomes among nondiabetic older adults who are scheduled for elective surgery.
