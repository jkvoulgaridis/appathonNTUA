    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery related acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) is a clinical problem associated with a
      cardiopulmonary bypass used during cardiac surgery procedures. In this study the
      investigators will assess the biochemical markers of acute kidney injury such as ischemia
      modified albumin (IMA) or urinary excreted of brush-border enzymes of the proximal renal
      tubules perioperatively. There has been no official recommendations toward routine use of
      analysed biomarkers.

      Cardiac surgery related acute kidney injury (CS-AKI) is an important clinical problem. Kidney
      injury occurs following a cardiopulmonary bypass used during cardiac surgery procedures. The
      pathomechanisms of acute kidney injury (AKI) is complex and multifactorial. It may involve
      few injury pathways: ischemia and reperfusion, endogenous toxins, inflammation, metabolic
      factors and oxidative stress. Biochemical markers of acute kidney injury such as ischemia
      modified albumin (IMA) or urinary excreted of brush-border enzymes of the proximal renal
      tubules analysed perioperatively will be assessed in this study. There has been no official
      recommendations toward routine use of analysed biomarkers.
