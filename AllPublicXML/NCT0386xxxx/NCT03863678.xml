      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of dry needling method in addition to
      neurodevelopmental therapy on spasticity, upper and lower extremity functions, balance and
      independence level in patients with stroke who have spasticity. In this study, goniometric
      measurement, Modified Ashworth Scale, Nine Hole Peg Test, 10 Meter Walking Test, Fullerton
      Advanced Balance Scale and Functional Independence Scale will be used for outcome
      measurement. The participants will be randomised into two groups; Group 1 will receive NDT
      and Group 2 will receive both NDT and dry needling therapy. Both groups will be given 45
      minutes of NDT, 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12 sessions). Group 2 will
      also receive dry needling therapy 3 sessions per week in 4 weeks period (total of 12
      sessions). Dry needling will be applied on M. Gastrocnemius, M.Quadriceps, M.Flexor Carpi
      Radialis and M.Biceps Brachii muscles. The application time on each muscle will be 60 seconds
      (sec). Fast in and fast out technique will be used for dry needling therapy. All patients
      will be measured before treatment (T1) and after treatment (T3). An inter-measurement will be
      performed after the treatment session (T2) in addition to T1 and T3 measurements in the Group
      2, to evaluate the acute effects of dry needling therapy. No additional treatment will be
      applied to the Group 1. All assessments will be performed by the same physiotherapist.

    <description>Measurement of joint movement of individuals will be done by a goniometer by the same physiotherapist. First passive normal joint movement then active normal joint movement will be evaluated and recorded.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and at the end of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified ashworth scale (MAS) will be used to evaluate the spasticity of upper (elbow flexors flexor carpi radialis) and lower (quadriceps and gastrocnemius) extremity muscles. The MAS assess the level of spasticity on ordinal scale from 0 to 4 based on the level of resistance in response to a quick and passive movement. According to the MAS scale, 0 represents no increase in muscle tone, 1 represents slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension, 1+ represents increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM, 2 represents more marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved, 3 represents considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult and 4 represents affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

    <measure>Nine Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and at the end of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NHPT (Nine Hole Peg Test); It is a time test in which the thin hand skill is quantitatively measured. During the test, the patient sits on the table where the nine hole board is located and closes the empty hole with the wooden or plastic bars.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Meter Walking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and at the end of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The walking speed of the patients will be measured with a ten-meter walking test (10MWT). The walking time of the patient in 10 meters is recorded in seconds and the walking speed in m / s is calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and at the end of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>He will use a total of 10 items of balance scale to assess the balance of the patients. Each item is rated between 0-4. It will be evaluated over 40 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the baseline and at the end of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a generic and global activity scale and shows how independent it is in daily basic, physical and cognitive activities.Each item is scored at seven levels (1-7), Level 1: Total Assistance, Level 7: Indicates full independence. The total FIM score may vary between 18-126. FIM is the most frequently used activity scale in the world in medical rehabilitation.</description>
