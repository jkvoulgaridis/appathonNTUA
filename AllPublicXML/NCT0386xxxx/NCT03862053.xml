      Manuka honey eye drops are used for dry eyes and blepharitis. Manuka honey has been proven to
      be useful for eczema, atopic dermatitis, wound healing, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic and
      anti-inflammatory actions.

      Ocular allergy is a condition that can affect a patient's quality of life. Symptoms of ocular
      allergy include but are not limited to red, itchy, swollen, foreign body sensation, watery,
      puffy or blurry eyes. irritation, redness, burning, foreign body sensation, dryness, pain and
      blurry vision. In many cases, ocular allergic conjunctivitis are due to seasonal allergens
      like pollen, mold or indoor allergens such as pet dander or dust mites.

      Ocular allergy can be treated by avoidance of known allergens, reduction of allergens by use
      of HEPA filters, cleaning linens, etc, topical decongestants, over the counter and
      prescription topical non-steroidals, topical or oral antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers or
      topical or oral steroids.

      Manuka honey is produced by bees that are associated with the flowers of the Manuka plant
      (Leptospermum scoparium) that grows in New Zealand. Manuka honey is different from other
      honeys because it has been shown to the more potent due to its higher methylglyoxal
      concentration.

      Manuka honey has been used for its anti-oxidant, anti-bacteral and anti-inflammatory
      properties. It has been shown to be useful in healing eczematous skin lesions. This study
      will attempt to demonstrate topical anti-allergy use for ocular allergy.
