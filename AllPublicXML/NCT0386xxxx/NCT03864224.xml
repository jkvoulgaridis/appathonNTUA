      GLA:D Back is a program developed in Denmark to help people with persistent low back pain.
      Unfortunately, all materials developed for the program are in Danish. In this pilot, the
      investigators will translate the Danish materials into English, then use them to conduct an
      English training session for community clinicians in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Interested
      clinicians will then implement the program in their communities and provide feedback to
      contextualize the program for use in English. Specifically, surveys, interviews and focus
      groups will be used to help fine-tune the printed content of the course (e.g. manuals), it's
      training materials (e.g. lectures) and processes related to REDCap data collection (e.g.
      surveys).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have persistent low back pain of at least 1 month's duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participating currently in a supervised exercise or rehabilitation program or enrolled
             in another interventional clinical trial.

          -  Patients with nerve root involvement, suspected serious pathology, unstable trauma to
             the spine, aspects of pregnancy or other conditions that would prevent participation
             or disallow trial completion within the prescribed time period.

          -  Persons with conditions that require a specialist consult are suspected of needing a
             specialist consult, or have conditions that would be aggravated or worsened if treated
             by the interventions in this study.
