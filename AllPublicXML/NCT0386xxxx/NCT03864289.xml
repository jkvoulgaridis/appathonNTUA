  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is focused on helping parents master the basic intervention skills and evaluate the
      effectiveness of this parental training style for children with autism spectrum disorder in
      China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a set of parental training curriculum about early intervention.

      The curriculum consists of three units: (1) Delivery of theoretical intervention knowledge
      and analysis of successful training cases; (2) Commenting and making suggestion on
      parent-child interaction videos; (3) Demonstration of intervention skills and practice .The
      contents of the curriculum involved setting up an environment, developing objectives (verbal
      communication, non-verbal communication, social interaction, imitation, fine motor skills,
      etc.), designing activities, dealing with challenging behavior. This study will help parents
      master the basic intervention skills(how to set up an environment, develop objectives, design
      activities, deal with challenging behavior, etc) . At last the investigators will evaluate
      the effectiveness of this parental training style for children with autism spectrum disorder
      in China.

    <measure>Change from baseline average score of the Interaction Fidelity Rating System at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to end of training（8 week）. The score will be measured at the following time point: enrollment,end of training.</time_frame>
    <description>The Interaction Fidelity Rating System is used to evaluate the quality of the parent mastery of intervention skills and the quality of interaction. It's a 5-point rating system (1-5) of 11 items. Parent fidelity is rated from the parent-child interaction videos by trainers. The investigators take the average score of the 11 items as a result. The highest score is 5 and the lowest is 1. The higher the score is, the better intervention skills the parents had.
The 5-point rating system:
1 - the strategy is not demonstrated or inappropriately applied.
2- the strategy is used somewhat appropriately at times.
3 - appropriate and accurate implementation of the strategy occurs up to 50% of the time.
4 - appropriate and accurate implementation of the strategy occurs up to 80% of the time.
5- Strategies are applied appropriately in 80-100% of opportunities.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline correct answer rate of the Questionnaire on Awareness and Knowledge of Interventions about Autism at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to end of training（8 week）. The correct rate will be measured at the following time point: enrollment, end of training.</time_frame>
    <description>The Questionnaire on Awareness and Knowledge of Interventions about Autism includes 11 questions. Parents filled in the questionnaire. The investigators take the correct rate as a result. If all the 11 questions were answered correctly, the correct rate would be 100%. The highest correct rate is 100% and the lowest is 0%.</description>
