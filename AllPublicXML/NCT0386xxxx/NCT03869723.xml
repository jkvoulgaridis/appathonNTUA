  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of virtual planning using customized
      surgical devices (VP3D) in fibula free flap mandibular reconstruction. Virtual planning was
      compared to postoperative scans using cephalometric and three-dimensional (3D) measurements.
      Operative times of both VP3D and conventional surgery groups were compared.

    <time_frame>Six months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The virtual model obtained using preoperative surgical planning will be compared with postoperative outcomes derived from facial bone scans conducted on all VP3D group patients 6 months after surgery (MIMICS INNOVATION suite 2.1 software, MATERIALISE, Leuven, Belgium).
The cephalometrics measurements (in mm) between the virtual model and postoperative outcomes will be compared.</description>

    <description>Fibula free flap in mandibular reconstruction using preoperative virtual planning, cutting guides and osteosynthesis plates. Preoperative modeling was conducted by obtaining scans of patient maxillofacial skeleton and angioscans of the lower extremities. The planning phase was then carried out by the surgeon and the engineer (from MATERIALISE, Leuven, Belgium) so as to define the clinical and technical parameters of the reconstruction. This stage consisted of discussing and determining osteotomy lines, donor side, anastomosis site, and overall reconstruction contour. Resection was decided by the surgeon. 3D modeling and the manufacture of cutting guides and customized osteosynthesis plates were then undertaken</description>
