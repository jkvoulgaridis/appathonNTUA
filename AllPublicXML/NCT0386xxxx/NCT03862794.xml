  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to reduce unnecessary prescription of antibiotics and broad spectrum
      antibiotics by general practitioners (GPs) in England. Unnecessary prescriptions are defined
      as those that do not improve patient health outcomes. The intervention is to send GPs a
      letter from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) that gives feedback on their practice's
      prescribing levels. Specifically the sample was GPs whose practices whose prescribed more
      than 1.161 items per STAR-PU or whose practices prescribed more that .965 items per STAR-PU
      and greater than 10% broad spectrum items. The intervention groups received a letter telling
      them they are among the highest prescribers of either their total or broad spectrum
      antibiotics, with a graph showing their prescribing compared to average prescribing (&quot;their
      peers&quot;). The letter also contained a leaflet to help GPs discuss self-care advice with
      patients and some advice to use delayed prescriptions. The investigators hypothesize that the
      antibiotic prescribing rate in will be lower for the treatment group compared to the control
      group, following the receipt of the letter.
