  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary intention of the study is to examine the effect of aged garlic extract (AGE) on
      the absolute change in coronary artery calcium (CAC). The second intention is to examine the
      effect of AGE on inflammatory biomarkers and microcirculation. It is a double blind placebo
      controlled study. The participants will ingest AGE during a period of one year. The CAC will
      be controlled by computer tomography (CT) scan; the inflammatory biomarkers through blood
      sample test and the microcirculation through laser speckel imagining and laser doppler before
      and after the one year period of AGE ingestion.

      Objectives:

      Effect on coronary artery atherosclerosis / the progression of atherosclerosis Effect on
      inflammatory and oxidation biomarkers Cholesterol lowering effect Effect on microcirculation

      Type of study:

      Randomized double blind controlled trial

      Number of patients: 80 patients

      Duration of the study:

      The patients will be studied for one year after they have entered the study. The total time
      of the study duration from the including date of the first patient to the analysis of the
      last patient entering the study estimated to be 2-3 years. An inclusion rate off 1 to 2
      patients per week.

      Treatment:

      Dose: Treated with a placebo capsule or a capsule containing a total of AGE 2400 mg daily for
      1 year (2 Kyolic capsule (600 mg) twice daily).

      Methods:

      Placebo-controlled double blind randomized trial to determine whether AGE can influence the
      rate of atherosclerosis plaque burden measured by coronary artery calcium, improve vascular
      function and microcirculation and favorably change biomarkers of oxidative stress.

      Randomization:

      The participants are assigned to AGE or placebo in a double-blinded manner, using numbered
      containers assigned to a computer-generated randomization chart by a nurse coordinator.

    <measure>Change in coronary artery calcium (CAC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>CAC is to be defined as a plaque of at least three contiguous pixels (area 1.02 mm 2) with a density of &gt; 130 Hounsfield units. The lesion score are to be calculated by multiplying the lesion area by a density factor derived from the maximal Hounsfield unit within this area, as described by Agatston S, Janowitz WR, Hildner FJ et al. Quantification of coronary artery calcium using ultrafast computed tomography. J Am Coll Cardiol 1990; 15: 827-832. CAC score is measured at baseline and after one year follow-up and the difference is calculated.</description>

    <measure>The changes in the microcirculation measured by Laser Doppler velocimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) is a non-invasive method to estimate the blood perfusion in the microcirculation. The advantage of the technique is that LDF provide a continuous or near continuous record of the microvascular blood flow. No current laser Doppler instrument can present absolute perfusion values (e.g. ml/min/100 gram tissue). Measurements are expressed as perfusion units (PU) which are arbitrary. The changes in PU will be measured.</description>
