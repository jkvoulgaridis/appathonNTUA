  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I randomized pilot trial will assess the efficacy of a fixed incentive payment
      program and drawing incentive payment program versus a control program to promote early
      childhood caries (ECC) preventive health behaviors (i.e., toothbrushing performance and
      dental visit attendance) for young children of predominantly Latino parents/caregivers
      enrolled in/waitlisted for Early Head Start (EHS) home visit programs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If both groups are acceptable and feasible, the reward group with toothbrushing outcomes at
      least 20% better than the other one (and the control) will be chosen for a future Phase
      II/III trial; if they are similar, the fixed monetary reward will be used because it is
      simpler to explain, monitor, and implement.

    <description>Eligible to earn a weekly payment during the 2-month incentive intervention period. Possible weekly winnings depend on toothbrushing performance collected through smart powered toothbrush synced to a smartphone app: low adherence threshold (brushing child's teeth once per day for 7 days in a week) will win $5; high adherence threshold (brushing twice per day for 14 days in a week) will win $10.</description>

    <description>Eligible to earn a weekly drawing entry with different winning probabilities during the 2-month incentive intervention period. Possible weekly winnings depend on toothbrushing performance collected through smart powered toothbrush synced to a smartphone app: low adherence threshold (brushing child's teeth once per day for 7 days in a week) will have an 18% chance of winning $25 and a 1% chance of winning $50 (expected $5 payout); high adherence threshold (brushing twice per day for 14 days in a week) will have a 34% chance of winning $25 and a 3% chance of winning $50 (expected $10 payout).</description>

Not a formal part of this trial, but rather a necessary condition to assure all participating parents/caregivers have the chance to earn the same monetary incentives.</description>
