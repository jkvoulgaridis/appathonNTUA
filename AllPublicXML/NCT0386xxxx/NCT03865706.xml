  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal gut bacteria prevent colonization and subsequent infection with MDR organisms (MDROs)
      through competition for resources and other mechanisms. During critical illness, this
      function of the microbiome is lost and there are no current treatments to restore it.
      Preliminary data indicates that the prebiotic fiber inulin is safe and may alter the
      gastrointestinal microbiome to improve gut barrier function, decrease colonization with
      MDROs, and reduce downstream risk for intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired MDR infections.
      However, the impact of inulin during critical illness is unknown. This double-blind,
      randomized clinical trial will test inulin for the prevention of antibiotic resistant
      infections in the ICU.

      The trial's specific aims are to determine (1) the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of
      inulin in the intensive care unit; (2) the impact of inulin on gut colonization with
      antibiotic-resistant pathogens; and (2A/exploratory) the impact of inulin on ICU-acquired
      antibiotic-resistant infections.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed trial hypothesizes that inulin maintains short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing
      colonic anaerobes and that these bacteria are protective against multi-drug resistant
      organism (MDRO) colonization and subsequent MDR infection. Inulin, a vegetable-derived
      non-digestible polysaccharide is well established as the key nutrient source for
      SCFA-producing bacteria. Previous human studies have shown that (1) inulin increases levels
      of SCFA producers and SCFAs and (2) that this increase correlates with improved colonic
      mucosal integrity and resistance to MDR pathogens. In animal studies, inulin improves
      survival after pathogen challenge or injection with lipopolysaccharide. The overall aim of
      this clinical trial is to determine whether inulin improves gut colonization resistance
      against antibiotic-resistant pathogens and therefore prevents antibiotic-resistant infections
      in the setting of critical illness. To accomplish this, 90 critically ill adults who are
      receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics will be blindly randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo,
      inulin 8 g twice daily, or inulin 16 g twice daily for a minimum of 7 days, with bedside
      follow-up extending to 30 days or hospital discharge.
