  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QuERI) is a knowledge translation medical
      practice activity based on decision making support through feedback to physicians on their
      management of dyslipidemia in order to achieve guidelines recommended LDL-C levels in high
      risk patients. Physician interaction has three distinct components:

        1. Capture of data as reported by participating physician;

        2. Highlight (by providing feedback) where management may be optimized based on guidelines
           or recommendations;

        3. Identify challenges faced by physicians resulting in the care gap..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GOAL QuERI International will engage approximately 115 health care practitioners (HCP)
      who will enroll up to 2500 patients with management observations based on four visits by the
      patients in an outpatient setting. The timing of the visits will be baseline, 6±2 months,
      12±2 months, and 18±2 months during which patient management by their physician will be
      captured using the electronic data capture form (DCF). The DCF will be created and managed by
      the CHRC.

        GOAL International enrolling approximately 2500 patients with clinical vascular disease or
        familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and LDL-C &gt; 2.0 mmol/L (77 mg/dl) despite maximally
        tolerated statin therapy. As part of an interactive knowledge translation component,
        physicians are asked to indicate their next steps in lowering of LDL-C and are then asked
        whether they will be following the guidelines and if not why not.
