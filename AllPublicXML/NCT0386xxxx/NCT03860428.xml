  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in very preterm newborns is associated with severe neonatal
      mor-bidity: intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing
      en-terocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Existing methods of management PDA do
      not reduce the incidence of these diseases. The efficacy of cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX)
      which are currently the standard of treatment in extreme preterm infants is about 70-80%. COX
      inhibitors have significant side effects. On the other hand, surgical ligation of the ductus
      arteriosus is associated with deterioration due to cardio-pulmonary problems and long-term
      complications. Paracetamol has been proposed for treatment of hemodynamically significant PDA
      because it has a different mecha-nism of action compared with COX inhibitors and a better
      safety profile.

      Recently, expectant approach has becoming more popular, although there is not enough evidence
      to support it.

      The objective of this study is to investigate whether in preterm infants, born at a GA less
      than 32 weeks, with a PDA (diameter &gt; 1.5 mm) at a postnatal age of &lt; 72 h, an expectant
      management is non-inferior to early treatment with regard to the composite of mortality
      and/or severe morbidity.
