      The study will examine the validity and reliability of the Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer
      Registry. Aspects of the analysis will cover parallel forms reliability, test-retest
      reliability, split half internal consistency and face validity of the Mediterranean
      Colorectal Cancer Registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although central cancer registry programs have many benefits (the determination of national
      cancer incidences, strategic planning of health care systems etc.) data entry in such
      programs is often collected in restricted variables and physicians participating in the
      registration process may not be able to interact with each other during the management of
      their patients. For these reasons, a complete record in national general cancer registries
      can only be established retrospectively and the direct contribution to patient-specific
      diagnosis / treatment is limited. On the other hand, local registries have many advantages
      like easy integration of the data into the hospital electronic systems and multidisciplinary
      proactive enrollment.

      Thus, characteristics of ongoing colorectal cancer registries (Swedish, South Australian,
      Oregon, Lublin, Ontario etc.) reported previously in the English medical literature are
      reviewed and an electronic form is tabulated for the Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer
      Registry. This study will examine the validity and reliability of this registry. Aspects of
      the analysis will cover construct validity, content validity, parallel forms reliability,
      test-retest reliability, split half internal consistency and face validity.

    <measure>Construct validity of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: answering multiple-choice items</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Construct validity will be based on the combination of qualitative and statistical methods in order to develop representative and structured set of multiple-choice items for colorectal cancer registry.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Content validity of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: answering multiple-choice items</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Content validity will be based on the combination of qualitative and statistical methods in order to develop shortest-possible but well-matched set of multiple-choice items reflecting the subjects being assessed in the colorectal cancer registry. .</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parallel forms reliability of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: answering multiple-choice items</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Parallel forms reliability will be based on assessments analyzing the extent to which the items answered by different responders correlate with each other within their domain. It will be evaluated by correlation scores or positive predictive values according to the subject being assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test-retest reliability of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: answering multiple-choice items</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Test-retest reliability will be based on the reproducibility of the answers to multiple-choice items during a specific time period of stable condition. It will be evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient or positive predictive values according to the subject being assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Split half internal consistency of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: answering multiple-choice items</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Split half internal consistency will be based on the comparison of two sets of items inquirying the same subject. It will be evaluated by correlation scores or positive predictive values according to the subject being assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Face validity of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: binary scoring of items</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Face validity will be based on the scores of respondents indicating their overall positive or negative impression after evaluating each item for every file they registered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Face validity of Mediterranean Colorectal Cancer Registry: the major reason behind the negative response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>For negative responses, respondents will provide further feedback whether the item was ambiguous, confusing, excessively short, excessively long or there was another reason for their negative impression.</description>
