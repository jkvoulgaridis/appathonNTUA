      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study (EFS) designed to evaluate the
      safety and device performance of The RenalGuard System in the management of patients admitted

      This is a prospective, single arm, early feasibility study (EFS) designed to evaluate the
      safety and device performance of The Reprieve System in the management of patients admitted
      with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure who require diuresis for the treatment of
      volume overload. Subjects will be referred by their physician if he/she feels that the
      subject could benefit from observed diuresis in a hospital setting.

      The device being utilized is called The Reprieve System (The System). By default, The System
      infuses a volume of hydration fluid equal to the volume of urine output. This is known as
      matched hydration. In addition, the clinician has the ability to adjust the matched setting
      such that RenalGuard can infuse hydration fluid to achieve a positive fluid balance (e.g.
      +100 ml/hr.) or a negative fluid balance (e.g. -100 ml/hr.). The purpose of this balanced
      fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension and vital organ
      dysfunction, or fluid overload that may lead to shortness of breath in subjects in whom high
      urine output is desired.

      All patients will be treated with The Reprieve System for up to 72-hours, at the
      investigators discretion. They will be followed for 30 days post discharge. The protocol will
      enroll up to 40 subjects to develop the clinical algorithm required to optimally and safely
      perform removal of volume. The study will be conducted in up to 5 sites in the United States.
