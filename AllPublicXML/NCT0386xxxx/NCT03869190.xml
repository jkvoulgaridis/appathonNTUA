  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, umbrella study in participants with
      locally advanced or metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) who have progressed during or
      following a platinum-containing regimen. The study is designed with the flexibility to open
      new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that
      demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify the participant
      population (e.g., with regard to prior anti-cancer treatment or biomarker status).
