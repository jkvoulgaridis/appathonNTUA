  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if Xiidra® lifitegrast plays a role in the refractive accuracy when administered
      to patients preoperatively who are scheduled for cataract surgery and have a tear break up
      time (TBUT) ≤ 10 seconds and central corneal staining as defined by the Oxford scale
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a 4-week multicenter investigator-initiated study, in which a maximum of 200
      subjects will be enrolled.

      As many as two thirds of patients undergoing cataract surgery have dry eye. Often this latter
      condition is under treated i.e., any dry eye treatment such as artificial tears, that is
      being pursued in not adequately controlling the visually significant ocular surface
      disruption, and patient still have corneal staining or a reduced tear break-up time (TBUT).

      The investigators hypothesize that lifitegrast administered at least 4-week prior to
      pre-operative biometry measurements will improve both the quality of measurements used to
      choose an intraocular lens implant for surgery and the symptoms of patients with this
      combination of conditions. This finding would suggest that pre-treatment with lifitegrast can
      improve both the accuracy of surgery and patient comfort.

          5. Willing and able to complete all required postoperative visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ocular surgery (e.g., intraocular, oculoplastic, corneal or refractive surgical
             procedure

             fluorescein staining, map dot fingerprint dystrophy, or the effect of any other
