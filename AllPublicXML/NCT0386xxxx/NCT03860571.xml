      Study type: Interventional Description of intervention(s) / exposure

      For single ascending dose, five dose target ranges of BT-11 (depending on body weight the
      doses in each cohort will be 5.9 - 7.7 mg/kg; 18.9 - 25.0 mg/kg; 44.3 - 50.0 mg/kg; 68.5 - 75
      mg/kg and 94.2 - 100.0 mg/kg) will be evaluated, based on subject's weight on Day 1.

      For multiple ascending dose (once daily for 7 days), three dose target ranges of BT-11
      (depending on body weight the doses in each cohort will be 5.9 - 7.7 mg/kg; 44.3 - 50.0
      mg/kg; and 94.2 - 100.0 mg/kg) will be evaluated, based on subject's weight on Day 1.

      White tablets containing 500 mg BT-11 or matching placebo tablets will be dispensed.

      Single ascending dose duration of administration will be once. For multiple ascending dose it
      will be up to 7 days.

      The mode administration will be oral tablet. Compliance and adherence to the intervention
      will be performed based on the tablet return, tablet not consumed by the subject.

      The safety monitoring committee will evaluate safety at conclusion of single ascending cohort
      2 prior to the commencement of dosing for the multiple ascending dose.

      Primary outcome: To assess the safety and tolerability of BT-11 after single and multiple
      ascending oral dose administration in healthy volunteers

      The safety and tolerability profile of BT-11 as evidenced by the occurrence, timing,
      frequency, and severity of adverse events (AE) and clinically significant:

        -  laboratory abnormalities Haematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, Urinalysis, HIV,
           HBsAg, HCV

        -  physical exam findings Complete physical exam include, at a minimum, assessment of the
           following systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose and throat, respiratory system,
           cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, neurological condition, blood and
           lymphatic systems, and the musculoskeletal system

        -  12-lead ECG aberrations ECG data (RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals and pulse rate)

        -  and/or vital signs abnormalities Vital signs assessments will include systolic and
           diastolic blood pressure, pulse, tympanic body temperature, and respirations

      Timepoint: Adverse events will be recorded from the time of first dosing through to end of
      study date.

      Laboratory abnormalities at the screening visit, up to 28 days prior to the first dose of
      study medication then up to end of study visit.

      Physical Exam findings will be collected at screening, Day-1 and Day 2 for the single
      ascending dose. For multiple ascending dose it will be collected at screening, Day-1, Day 3,
      Day 5 and Day 7

      12-lead ECG aberrations will be collected from Screening then on Day -1 and Day 2 for the
      single ascending dose. For MAD it will be collected at screening, Day-1, Day 3, Day 5 and Day
      7

      Vital signs abnormalities collected from Screening then on Day -1 and Day 2 for the single
      ascending dose. For MAD it will be collected at screening, Day-1, Day 3, Day 5 and Day 7

      Primary outcome: To assess the safety and tolerability of BT-11 after single and multiple
      ascending oral dose administration in healthy volunteers.

      Timepoint: For single ascending dose blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose
      and at 15, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose

      Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose and 0-24 hours post-dose;

      30, and 45 min and 1, 1.25 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 18 hours post Day 1 dose. Pre-dose
      on Day 2

      Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1, pre-dose and at 0-24 hours
      post-dose

      On follow up period, Day 3 to Day 6, Plasma samples for PK analysis will be collected
      pre-dose on each day.

      Secondary outcome: The following PK parameters will be determined:

        -  Time to maximum concentration (tmax);

        -  Maximum concentration (Cmax);

          1. Healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive.

          2. Body weight 65 - 85 kg.

          3. Body Mass Index (weight in kg divided by square of height in meters) 19-31 kg/m2,

          4. Male volunteers must agree to abstain, between dosing and 30 days post-dosing, from
             sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women and, if sexually active with a
             female partner, to use a condom in addition to his female partner's use of another
             form of contraception (e.g., IUD, diaphragm, oral contraceptive, injectable
             progesterone contraceptive, subdermal implant contraceptive, or tubal ligation). A
             male practicing abstinence is also acceptable.

          5. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, with a fertile male sexual partner, should
             be willing to use adequate contraception from Day 1 until 30 days after the follow-up
             visit. Adequate contraception is defined as an intrauterine device combined with at
             least one of the following forms of contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a
             condom. Also, total abstinence, in accordance with the lifestyle of the subject, is
             acceptable.

          6. Volunteer agrees not to take any concomitant medications, including prescriptions or
             over-the-counter (OTC) medications during the interval from 3 days prior to dosing
             until after the last PK blood draw for the study.

          7. Volunteer agrees not to consume alcohol during the interval from 3 days prior to
             dosing until after the last PK blood draw for the study.

          8. Volunteer is able to communicate effectively with study personnel.

          9. Volunteer is able to understand and comply with protocol and investigative site
             requirements, instructions, and restrictions.

         10. Volunteer has read, confirmed understanding of, and signed the written informed

             consent document have been fully explained and all of the Volunteer's questions have
             been answered to his or her satisfaction, prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinically significant abnormality identified in the screening history, physical
             examination (including Vital Signs), laboratory testing, or electrocardiographic
             testing. Repeat testing of vital signs to confirm the value is allowed. Up to two
             repeat tests are permitted to confirm eligibility.

          2. An excessive fall in blood pressure on orthostatic testing at screening or Day -1
             (i.e., a fall in systolic blood pressure &gt; 25 mmHg or in diastolic blood pressure &gt; 15
             mmHg).

          3. Any 12-lead ECG finding at screening or on Day -1 that may, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, compromise interpretation of ECGs for cardiac safety assessment or
             complicate interpretation of events that may occur post-dose (e.g., QT not accurately
             measurable, conduction abnormalities)

          4. Positive test for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody.

          5. Any clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurologic, or other

             insufficient peripheral venous access.

         13. Volunteer has donated blood or blood products in volumes of 450 mL or more within 30
             days prior to study enrollment.

         14. Volunteer has been previously exposed to BT-11.

         15. Volunteer has participated in a study of any investigational drug, device, biologic,
             or other agent within 30 days prior to study enrollment.

         16. Volunteer has known hypersensitivity to BT-11 or any of its constituents.

         17. Volunteer has any disorder (e.g., psychiatric, addictive) that, in Investigator's
