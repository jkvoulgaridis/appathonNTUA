  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of upper limb exercise training in
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. For the purpose of the study, a
      controlled trial will be conducted within Respiratory Clinic of Nicosia General Hospital. The
      sample will be divided in two groups. The intervention group will participate in a pulmonary
      rehabilitation program which includes upper and lower extremities exercises, with addition of
      arm ergometer. The second group (control group) will participate in the same program but
      without arm ergometer training.

      The study's hypothesis is that the intervention group will improve the outcome measures
      significantly better than the control group.
