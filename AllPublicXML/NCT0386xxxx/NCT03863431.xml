  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of high-carbohydrate vs. high-fat overfeeding (130% of
      energy requirements) on whole body insulin sensitivity.

      Following habitual diet, participants will be randomly allocated to either a
      high-carbohydrate or a high-fat diet intervention for 14-days. On days 0, 7 and 14
      participants will undergo anthropometric and metabolic testing (primarily an oral glucose
      tolerance test [OGTT]).
