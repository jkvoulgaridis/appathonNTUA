  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brånemark System® dental implant osseointegration was introduced clinically in 1965 as a
      novel approach to the replacement of missing teeth. Although this implant's traditional
      machined screw-shaped surface had excellent, well-documented short- and long-term clinical
      success, newer implant designs were introduced that could enhance fusion of the implant to
      jaw bones and better resist functional forces. These characteristics could lead to less bone
      loss, according to manufacturers. One such implant, Screw-Vent®, had a macro-structure very
      similar to that of the Brånemark implant. However, its fixture surface was acid-etched which
      could enhance osseointegration, and it had a longer narrower machined internal-hex
      interlocking flat collar that could better resist occlusal forces. However, one clinical
      study had reported greater short-term bone loss with this implant compared to the Brånemark
      implant, possibly due to its longer machined flat collar, and had advocated long-term
      clinical studies. Therefore,this within-subject clinical trial was undertaken in 1993 to
      first compare the Brånemark implant with another implant, Swede-Vent®, a copy of the
      Brånemark macro-structure except for its fixture surface that was identically acid-etched as
      that of Screw-Vent by the same manufacturer. The effect on bone healing could then be
      compared between Brånemark's machined and Swede-Vent's acid-etched surfaces in the short- and
      long-terms. Since Screw-Vent's fixture surface was identically acid-etched as that of
      Swede-Vent by the same manufacturer, the investigators could then evaluate the effect on bone
      healing of Screw-Vent's longer, narrower machined flat collar and the identical shorter,
      wider machined flat collars of Swede-Vent and Brånemark. All three 2-part platform-matched
      parallel-wall implants were made of commercially pure titanium, had a very similar fixture
      macro-design, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (USA) and Health and Welfare
      Canada, and were commercially available in North America. Brånemark is still available, but
      with an oxidized microtextured fixture surface. Screw-Vent is still available with its
      microtextured fixture surface. Swede-Vent is no longer available. Results obtained at the
      15-20 year recall period were published, and the present study is a continuation of this
      within-subject clinical trial.to the 23-26 year recall.

    <measure>Comparison of quantitative bone healing.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 23-26 years of function.</time_frame>
    <description>Distance between first bone-to-implant contact point (fBIC) and microgap (MG) placed at the crest will be measured in mm (on standardized periapical radiographs) at the right and left sides of each implant-abutment complex. Mean fBIC-MG values will be calculated, recorded and compared between B and SW, between B and SC and between SW and SC for Configuration 1(Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 1), Configuration 2 (Brånemark 1, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 2), and Configuration 3 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 1, Screw-Vent 2).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of soft tissue healing: height of keratinized gingiva.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 23-26 years of function.</time_frame>
    <description>Height of the keratinized gingiva will be measured in mm using a ColorVue UNC12 Hu-Friedy probe on the buccal and lingual surfaces of the trans-epithelial abutments. Mean values will be calculated, recorded and compared between B and SW, between B and SC and between SW and SC for Configuration 1 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 1), Configuration 2 (Brånemark 1, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 2), and Configuration 3 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 1, Screw-Vent 2).</description>

    <description>Using a ColorVue UNC12 Hu-Friedy probe (and a light pressure of 0.25N), pocket depth will be measured in mm on the buccal, lingual, mesial and distal abutment surfaces. Mean values will be calculated, recorded and compared between B and SW, between B and SC and between SW and SC for Configuration 1(Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 1), Configuration 2 (Brånemark 1, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 2), and Configuration 3 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 1, Screw-Vent 2).</description>

    <description>Presence or absence of plaque and gingival bleeding on probing will be evaluated using the dichotomous/binary plaque index (dPI) and bleeding index (dBI). Values of 0 (none present) or 1 (present) will be recorded. All values will be compared between B and SW, between B and SC and between SW and SC for Configuration 1 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 1), Configuration 2 (Brånemark 1, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 2), and Configuration 3 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 1, Screw-Vent 2).</description>

    <description>Presence or absence of purulent exudate on probing will be evaluated. Values of 0 (none present) or 1 (present) will be recorded. All values will be compared between B and SW, between B and SC and between SW and SC for Configuration 1 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 1), Configuration 2 (Brånemark 1, Swede-Vent 2, Screw-Vent 2), and Configuration 3 (Brånemark 2, Swede-Vent 1, Screw-Vent 2).</description>
