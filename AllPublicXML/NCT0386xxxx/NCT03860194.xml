  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is defined as a syndrome characterized by decline of skeletal muscle mass and
      strength or an alteration in physical function. Although some studies showed nutritional
      supplementation alone might have health benefits for older sarcopenic patients, the results
      were inconsistent and remain controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a
      sufficient protein diet including supplements with leucine-enriched whey protein and vitamin
      D can lead to better improvement than sufficient dietary protein alone in maintaining muscle
      mass and strength among sarcopenic elders.

    <measure>AMMI(appendicular muscle mass index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measures (baseline and 4 weeks, baseline and 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to obtain appendicular muscle mass (AMM) and height. The unit of AMM and height were represented as kilogram and meter respectively. AMMI were calculated as AMM/height^2 (kg/m^2).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measures (baseline and 4 weeks, baseline and 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Hand dynamometer was used to measure handgrip strength. Subject was asked to sit in an upright position with the upper arm forming a virtually 90 degree angle with the forearm. Three consecutive measurements of grip strength obtained from both hands were recorded and average of the highest value was calculated as the maximum grip strength. The unit of handgrip strength was represented as kilogram.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Change measures (baseline and 4 weeks, baseline and 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Asking the subjects to perform a 5-meter walk at their usual pace and measure how much second they could complete this distance, then the unit of gait speed was represented as m/s.</description>

    <description>Each participant received nutritional counseling and recommended each of them to consume 1.5 g protein/kg body weight (BW)/day. Participants were encouraged to consume a balanced diet with six food groups follow &quot;Daily dietary guideline of 2013 &quot; as recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan. However, 1.2 g protein/kg body weight (BW)/day was suggested from this guideline.
Subjects in the Supp group were provided with Protison with High Protein 51(Original Flavor) containing supplements in addition to their regular daily meals to achieve 1.5 g protein/kg (BW)/day on the basis of this guideline.</description>

However, 1.2 g protein/kg body weight (BW)/day was suggested from this guideline.
Subjects in the Diet group were instructed to consume ordinary high protein foods to achieve 1.5 g protein/kg body weight (BW)/day on the basis of this guideline, and suggested to equally distribute their meal time.</description>
