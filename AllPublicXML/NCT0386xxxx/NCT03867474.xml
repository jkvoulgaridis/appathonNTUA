  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      experience less efficiency in performing complex everyday tasks, which may result in a
      general sense of discontentment and decreased satisfaction with their overall functional
      performance. Additionally, SCD and MCI have been associated with concomitant anxiety,
      depressive mood, perceived stress, a decrease in emotional well-being and quality-of-life
      (QoL) among community-dwelling older adults. These concomitant psychosocial issues may result
      in emotional distress which further exacerbates cognitive decline.

      At the present time, there is a lack of evidence that supports pharmacologic interventions to
      ameliorate concomitant psychosocial issues with this particular population due to medication
      side-effects, drug-drug interaction and polypharmacy. Consequently, exploring alternative
      non-pharmacological interventions to assist in ameliorating psychosocial issues is an
      important consideration. Secondly, evaluating perceived satisfaction on functional
      performance with those living with SCD and MCI, and assessing interventions that may support
      this is also worthwhile to pursue. Primary care providers are often the first point of
      contact when older adults and their families become concerned about memory problems. Health
      care professionals, on an interdisciplinary Family Health Team (FHT), such as occupational
      therapists, are well-positioned to holistically address both the psychosocial and functional
      needs in a client/family centred way with this growing population in primary care. The study
      proposes to offer a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, which is an 8-week
      program that has been shown to be beneficial in alleviating emotional distress among adults
      living with physical and psychological issues in the general population.

      Purpose: The overarching purpose of this study is to determine whether MBSR is appropriate
      for a larger clinical trial. AIM 1: To explore the feasibility of conducting a randomized
      control trial (RCT) of an occupational therapist-led, 8-week MBSR program in an
      interprofessional primary care setting, with the following objectives: 1a. To assess
      participant recruitment, intervention adherence, and study retention, 1b. To explore the
      acceptability of delivering technology-based tablets (iPads) for intervention, and data
      collection in the MBSR program and 1c. To explore the perspectives of participants and
      healthcare providers with respect to satisfaction (e.g. the intervention and its delivery),
      perceived value, barriers to and facilitators of acceptability of this 8-week MBSR program in
      primary care.

      AIM 2: To evaluate the impact of MBSR on satisfaction with functional performance and
      psychosocial outcomes in individuals with SCD or MCI with the following objectives: 2a. To
      determine the effect sizes of satisfaction with functional performance and psychosocial
      outcomes Methods: A convergent mixed-methods, feasibility randomized control trial will be
      used. Participants will be randomized into an 8-week intervention or control group (usual
      care) and these groups will be compared at three different time points. Initially, data
      analysis will involve collecting and analyzing the quantitative and qualitative strands
      separately. Both qualitative and quantitative data will then be merged for comparative
      analysis to best understand both the feasibility of a larger clinical trial and to explore
      preliminary clinical outcomes from the study.

      Significance: The results gained from this study will help to determine the feasibility of
      pursuing a future fully powered trial. Ultimately, this line of research will determine if
      there are potential benefits of MBSR in improving perceived satisfaction of functional
      performance and alleviating concomitant psychosocial issues that is associated with those
      living with SCD and MCI.

    <description>The intervention group will be delivered in a group-based format, for one three-hour session per week for an 8-week period. Each session will consist of mindfulness practice (e.g. lying down body scan, sitting meditation, mindful eating, mindful movements such as walking and light hatha yoga movements) along with an inquiry about the practice. Strategies on stress reactivity, responding to stress, and some basic content on cognitive behaviour therapy principles will also be taught. Participants will be placed in dyads during the group. Homework practice will be given to complete on a daily basis for approximately 30-45 minutes. During week six participants will attend an all-day silent meditation retreat on a Saturday (Total of 10 sessions = 8 sessions, 1 orientation, and 1 all-day retreat).</description>
