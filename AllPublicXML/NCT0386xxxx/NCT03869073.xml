    <textblock>
      This study evaluates using evolocumab, a currently approved and marketed biologic drug, in a
      novel way. Patients who present to the emergency room or intensive care unit (ICU) with
      severe infection are eligible. Either the patient or their designated decision maker will be
      approached for consent. If they choose to participate they will be given either a single dose
      of evolocumab, a higher single dose of evolocumab,or a single dose of placebo. Participants
      will be followed during their stay in the ICU and will receive follow up phone calls at Day
      28 and 90.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evolocumab is currently approved and marketed in USA and Canada for lowering cholesterol
      levels. Evolocumab is an anti-PSCK9 monoclonal antibody, and functions by binding PSCK9 (an
      inhibitor of LDL removal) and blocking its function. Evidence suggests that since evolocumab
      increases the removal rate of low-density lipoproteins from the body, it might also help
      increase the removal of bacterial components that are attached to circulating lipids during
      sepsis. Quickly removing these bacterial components could prevent a strong and rapid immune
      response that often leads to organ failure and death in sepsis patients.
