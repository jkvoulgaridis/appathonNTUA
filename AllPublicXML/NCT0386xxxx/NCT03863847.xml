    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a novel neurofeedback treatment on pain specific
      brainwaves in adults.

      Chronic pain patients enrolled in this study will be randomized into a treatment group and a
      sham group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has underlined that central nervous system structures play a key role in the
      development of pain with significant maladaptive plasticity occurring in several brain areas.
      Non-pharmacological treatments, such as neurofeedback, are designed to restore normal brain
      function alongside with relieving pain symptoms. With a neurofeedback approach, the patient
      is provided with a feedback on specific brain waves recorded using non-invasive recording
      techniques (electroencephalography - EEG) and visualized on a screen.
