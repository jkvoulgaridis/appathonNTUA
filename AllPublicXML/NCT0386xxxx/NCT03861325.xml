  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that patients with septic shock in ICU have acute
      intestinal insufficiency favoring subclinical microbial translocation, which is the
      consequence of alterations of the epithelium, and is accompanied by qualitative and
      quantitative changes in the gut microbiota.

      The primary objective is to determine the incidence of microbial translocation by measuring
      16S rDNA and 18S rDNA plasma levels in a patient population with septic shock.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  Describe the kinetics of markers of intestinal insufficiency (I-FABP / zonulin) over
           time (at admission, 12 hours after admission, one day, two day, three days and seven day
           after admission).

        -  Study the correlation between the titer of I-FABP, zonulin, 16srDNA, 18srDNA and the
           stages of acute gastrointestinal insufficiency (AGF).

        -  Establish correlations between the microorganisms of the intestinal microbiota and the
           bacteria involved in microbial translocation.

        -  Study the possible correlations between the 16SrDNA levels and the other bacterial
           markers (sCD14, LBP).

        -  Describe the evolution of the composition and the diversity of the gut microbiota in the
           first 7 days of septic shock

      All eligible patients admitted for septic shock in resuscitation at Nimes will be included in
      the study, after verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and with their
      agreement.

      This is an observational study with no impact on the quality of care provided. All study data
      will be entered into an electronic CRF (e-CRF) directly or from the paper version of the
      scorecard.

      The entry into the e-CRF is controlled and formatted to prohibit the input of out-of-bounds
      or outliers. In case of modification of data entry, traceability and monitoring of activities
      is ensured. An electronic signature committing the responsibility of the investigator of each
      center will allow the validation of the visit and the e-CRF.

      Only those persons participating in the research project and identified will have access to
      the software allowing this entry: Redcap.

      Redcap software that allows you to generate electronic CRFs (e-CRF), electronically capture
      data, manage it and restore it. It also makes it possible to follow the progress of studies
      in terms of data entry and to manage them. It is open source software that is extensible,
      modular and based on international standards.

      Redcap software allows:

        -  Data entry, validation and annotation by clinicians and research associates

        -  Data extraction, filtering and analysis by investigators

        -  Study management by study coordinators

        -  Monitoring, auditing, configuration and reporting by administrators The electronic
           observation notebook creation software is hosted on a website within the CHU of Nîmes.
           Access to this application is secure and is via a password. Data collected through this
           software is backed up daily on a secure network. The network is connected to the
           internet, the access is protected by a firewall.

      The clinical data of the study will be stored on a specific directory of the server. Only the
      network administrators and the authorized persons of the clinical research unit of the
      medical information department can have access to this directory.

      IT arrangements made to enforce the confidentiality commitment

        -  The technical resources are located in the IT department whose access is controlled and
           secure.

        -  The data is stored on a server hosted in a secure room at the CHU Nîmes.

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota is based on the high-throughput sequencing of all bacteria in a stool sample by targeting the 16S rRNA genes. The first step of this technique is to PCR amplify a 16S rDNA genomic target (eg V3-V4 regions) from stool sample DNA and to control the amplified sequences (called &quot;libraries&quot;). The second step consists in sequencing the libraries on a sequencing automaton. The bioinformatic analysis of the sequences consists of making a reference sequence library of the 16S rDNA target and aligning the sequences obtained with this database in order to establish lists of present organisms and taxonomic trees (OTU - operational taxonomic unit).</description>
