    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and
      PK/PD of SCB-313 (recombinant human TRAIL-Trimer fusion protein) administered once via
      intrapleural injection (SAD) and once daily over 2 to 3 days (MAD)for the treatment of cancer
      patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusions requiring drainage.

             abstinence, intrauterine device, double barrier method (such as condom plus diaphragm
             with spermicide), contraceptive implant, hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills,
             implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices, or injections with prolonged
             release), or vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia.
