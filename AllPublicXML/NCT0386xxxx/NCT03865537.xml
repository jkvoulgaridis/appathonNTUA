  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares different approaches to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of large
      non-pedunculated colorectal polyps (â‰¥20mm) in a 2 x 2 randomized design. The first
      randomization will assign half of patients to polyp resection with electrocautery (&quot;hot&quot;
      snare EMR) and half of patient to polyp resection without electrocautery (&quot;cold&quot; snare EMR).
      The second randomization will assign half of patients to polyp removal using Eleview as the
      submucosal injection agent, and the other half using placebo (normal saline with methylene
      blue) as the submucosal injection agent.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrocautery, or hot snare resection has long been considered the standard approach to
      polyp resection. A major limitation is a 5 to 10% risk of major adverse events. Recent
      studies suggest that snare resection without electrocautery - so-called cold snare EMR - may
      be safer than hot snare EMR. The concern with cold snare resection is a potentially lower
      efficacy, because cold snare resection requires the removal of a large polyp in smaller and
      greater number of pieces than with hot snare resection. This may lengthen procedure time and
      increase the risk of incomplete resection.

      Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the optimal injection solution for lifting of the
      polyp prior to resection. Normal saline with methylene blue as the contrast agent is
      frequently used, but is limited by fast dissipation of the polyp lift. Eleview is a newly
      approved viscous solution (that contains methylene blue), which provides a longer polyp lift
      than normal saline. It is unclear how these two solutions compare with respect to resection
      efficacy and safety.
