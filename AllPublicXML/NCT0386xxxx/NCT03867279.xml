  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. A deficit of dorsiflexion and motor control can limit the performance of a
      squat. Neuromuscular reeducation exercises, mobility and elasticity are used in the
      neuromuscular control and mobility of the kinetic chain. The Flossing technique is applied to
      improve ankle mobility and the perception of effort.

      Objective. To compare the efficacy of a protocol for neuromuscular reeducation exercises,
      mobility and elasticity, and the Flossing technique in ankle mobility and perception of
      effort when performing squats.

      Study design. Randomized, multicenter, single-blind clinical study with a follow-up period.

      Methodology. 40 weightlifters included in the study will be assigned randomly to the study
      groups: experimental (protocol of reeducation exercises plus the application of the Flossing
      technique) and control (protocol of reeducation exercises). The intervention will last 4
      weeks, with two weekly sessions of 15 minutes each. The variables of the study will be the
      range of movement of ankle dorsiflexion (Weight Bearing Lunge Test) and the perception of the
      effort during the squat (Borg scale). A descriptive statistical analysis will be carried out
      calculating the main statistical characteristics. The distribution of the sample will be
      analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnof test. In case of homogeneity, parametric tests will be
      used to calculate changes after each evaluation (t-student) and the intra- and intersubject
      effect (repeated measures ANOVA).

      Expected results. Improvement in dorsiflexion of the ankle and decrease in the perception of
      effort during the squat.

    <measure>Change from baseline dorsal ankle flexion after treatment and at a month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The dorsal ankle flexion will be measured with the Weight-bearing lunge test. The subject will stand in front of a wall, using a tape measure that goes from the wall to the first toe. The subject will perform the greatest dorsiflexion of the ankle that allows him to touch the wall without lifting the ankle. The greater distance that this objective achieves will be the reference value. The unit of measurement of this test is the centimeter, indicating a higher score a greater range of ankle movement in dorsiflexion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline level of effort perceived after treatment and at a month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The level of effort will be measured with the modified Borg scale. With this test, the level of effort perceived by the athlete when performing the gesture of the squat will be measured. With the subject standing you will be asked to perform a squat, asking him to indicate on the scale what his level of effort has been. This scale has a range of 0 to 10 points (where 0 indicates the minimum degree of effort, and 10 the maximum effort referred by the subject).</description>

    <description>The reeducation exercises are: lunge and hold (the subject performs a lunge increasing the dorsiflexion of the ankle, advancing the tibia as much as possible without taking off the heel of the floor and without valgus of the knee, 15 repetition of 10 seconds of duration each); back squat (squat with a pike supported on scapulae); and chaturanga (from the prone position with extension of elbows and spine, the subject raises upper antero iliac spines performing a shoulder flexion and raising the pelvis to the ceiling maintaining the hip flexion and knees extended and keeping the heels touching the ground. The subjects included in this group will perform the exercises while a compression band is applied to the ankle.</description>
