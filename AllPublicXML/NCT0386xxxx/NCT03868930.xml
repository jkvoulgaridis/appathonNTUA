  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, the investigators extend their previous SPiRE feasibility and preliminary
      effectiveness study to examine STEP-Home efficacy in a RCT design. This novel therapy will
      target the specific needs of a broad range of underserved post-9/11 Veterans. It is designed
      to foster reintegration by facilitating meaningful improvement in the functional skills most
      central to community participation: emotional regulation (ER), problem solving (PS), and
      attention functioning (AT). The skills trained in the STEP-Home workshop are novel in their
      collective use and have not been systematically applied to a Veteran population prior to the
      investigators' SPiRE study. STEP-Home will equip Veterans with skills to improve daily
      function, reduce anger and irritability, and assist reintegration to civilian life through
      return to work, family, and community, while simultaneously providing psychoeducation to
      promote future engagement in VA care.

      The innovative nature of the STEP-Home intervention is founded in the fact that it is: (a) an
      adaptation of an established and efficacious intervention, now applied to post-9/11 Veterans;
      (b) nonstigmatizing (not &quot;therapy&quot; but a &quot;skills workshop&quot; to boost acceptance, adherence and
      retention); (c) transdiagnostic (open to all post-9/11 Veterans with self-reported
      reintegration difficulties; Veterans often have multiple mental health diagnoses, but it is
      not required for enrollment); (d) integrative (focus on the whole person rather than specific
      and often stigmatizing mental and physical health conditions); (e) comprised of
      Veteran-specific content to teach participants cognitive behavioral skills needed for
      successful reintegration (which led to greater acceptability in feasibility study); (f)
      targets anger and irritability, particularly during interactions with civilians; (g)
      emphasizes psychoeducation (including other available treatment options for common mental
      health conditions); and (h) challenges beliefs/barriers to mental health care to increase
      openness to future treatment and greater mental health treatment utilization. Many Veterans
      who participated in the development phases of this workshop have gone on to trauma or other
      focused therapies, or taken on vocational (work/school/volunteer) roles after STEP-Home.

      The investigators have demonstrated that the STEP-Home workshop is feasible and results in
      pre-post change in core skill acquisition that the investigators demonstrated to be directly
      associated with post-workshop improvement in reintegration status in their SPiRE study. Given
      the many comorbidities of this cohort, the innovative treatment addresses multiple aspects of
      mental health, cognitive, and emotional function simultaneously and bolsters reintegration in
      a short-term group to maximize cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-9/11 Veterans who served in OEF/OIF face many challenges as they re-enter civilian life
      after structured military careers. Yet, underutilization and resistance to mental health
      treatment remains a significant problem. Recent investigations of community reintegration
      problems among returning Veterans found that half of combat Veterans who use Veterans
      Administration (VA) services reported difficulty in readjusting to civilian life, including
      difficulty in social functioning, productivity in work and school settings, community
      involvement, and self-care domains. High rates of marital, family, and cohabitation discord
      were reported, with 75% reporting a family conflict in the last week. At least one-third
      reported divorce, dangerous driving and risky behaviors, increased substance use, and
      impulsivity and anger control problems since deployment. Almost all Veterans expressed
      interest in receiving services to help readjust to civilian life, and receiving reintegration
      services at a VA facility was reported as the preferred way to receive help. Mental health
      and anger problems are often cited as driving Veterans' difficulties readjusting to civilian
      life. Anger is becoming more widely recognized for its involvement in the psychological
      adjustment problems of post-9/11 Veterans. Research has shown that anger directly influences
      treatment outcome. In fact, history of untreated PTSD and aggression have been demonstrated
      to be pervasive among post-9/11 Veterans who die by suicide in the months before death.
      Veterans with probable PTSD report more reintegration and anger problems, and greater
      interest in services than Veterans without. Reintegration and anger problems continue for
      years post-combat and may not resolve without intervention.

      Research on TBI in post-9/11 Veterans underscores the need for programs that utilize an
      interdisciplinary approach to reintegration. Programs designed to address challenges of
      Veterans as they reintegrate in vocational environments, particularly integrative approaches,
      are greatly needed. The STEP-Home intervention provides such a program. STEP-Home includes
      focused cognitive and emotional regulation skills training and is informed by the most recent
      research with returning Veterans and available programs focused on reintegration in VA and
      military settings (e.g., Battlemind training).

      Phase 1: Years 1 and 2 The investigators will initiate the study at the Boston VAMC and
      develop Standard Operating Procedures for the addition of site 2 in Phase 2.

      Phase 2: Years 3 and 4 The investigators will initiate the study at the second site, the
      Houston VAMC, in Year 3. The investigators will apply in Year 2 for IRB approval to initiate
      site 2.

      Hypotheses &amp; Aims

      Primary Aim 1. Examine treatment effects of STEP-Home on primary outcomes relative to Present
      Centered Group Therapy (PCGT):

      Hypothesis 1A. Participants randomized into the STEP-Home intervention will show improvement
      on reintegration, readjustment, and anger post-intervention (expressed by lower scores; less
      difficulty).

      Military to Civilian Questionnaire (M2CQ), Post-Deployment Readjustment Inventory (PDRI), and
      State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2) scores post-intervention (T4) &lt; baseline
      (T1)

      Hypothesis 1B. Participants randomized into STEP-Home will show greater improvement in
      primary outcomes as compared to PCGT.

      Change scores baseline (T1) to post-intervention (T4) STEP-Home &gt; PCGT change scores
      Post-intervention (T4) primary outcome scores STEP-Home &lt; PCGT primary outcome scores (T4)

      Primary Aim 2. Examine maintenance of treatment effects on primary outcomes:

      Hypothesis 2: Treatment effects will be maintained at follow up in both groups. Differential
      treatment effect of STEP-Home over PCGT post-intervention (T4) will be maintained at follow
      up (T5).

      Exploratory Aim 1. Explore treatment effects of STEP-Home on measures of mental health,
      functional and vocational status and cognitive secondary outcomes targeted indirectly in the
      workshop.

      Exploratory Hypothesis 1. Acquisition of core skills (problem solving, emotional regulation,
      attention training) will mediate the effect of treatment on primary outcomes
      post-intervention and at follow up.

      The successful completion of the aims proposed has the potential to significantly improve
      skills to foster civilian reintegration in post-9/11Veterans. Furthermore, the STEP-Home
      SPiRE feasibility study demonstrated that the workshop also serves as a gateway for Veterans
      who are hesitant to participate in traditional mental health treatments to promote openness
      and engagement in additional, critically needed, VA services. Given the high rate of
      treatment resistance in this cohort, developing acceptable interventions that promote
      treatment engagement and retention, and open the door to future VA care, is necessary to
      improve functional status and to reduce long-term healthcare costs of untreated mental health
      illnesses.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two group interventions: STEP-Home or Present Centered Group Therapy (PCGT). Each cohort will include a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 20 participants who will be randomized to either STEP-Home (n = 4-10 Veterans) or PCGT (n = 4-10 Veterans). After inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified and a cohort of 8 to 20 is available, randomization into STEP-Home or PCGT occurs and participation in the study begins (i.e., Time 1; T1: Pre), during which the investigators will consent, administer the baseline assessments, randomly assign to the STEP-Home or PCGT arm, and schedule the treatment sessions. All participants will be assessed at the following outcome points: Screening, at randomization (T1), during treatment 4-week skills check (T2), during treatment 8-week skills check (T3), post-intervention (T4), and at 3-months follow up (T5).</intervention_model_description>
