  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cystoscopy procedure may cause pain and anxiety in patients. Since cystoscopy causes more
      pain in men, studies on pain and anxiety during cystoscopy are more common in men than women.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of watching relaxing video during cystoscopy
      on the pain and anxiety levels of female patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystoscopy is a safe procedure with low risk of morbidity commonly used to evaluate lower
      urinary tract symptoms such as hematuria, voiding disorders, irritant bladder symptoms,
      anatomical disorders. Patients experience pain and anxiety when cystoscope is inserted into
      the bladder. The various methods (drug or non-drug) are used for pain and anxiety during the
      cystoscopy. Although there are a lot of studies on male patients, there are limited studies
      evaluating pain severity in the female patients during urological procedures. In addition,
      there wasn't found any randomized controlled study for video use from non-drug methods to
      distract attention in these patients. Based on the study results in the literature,
      investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of watching relaxing video on the pain and anxiety
      levels of female patients during rigid cystoscopy.

    <description>The average score change on pain intensity as measured by Visual Analog Scale. This scale is an unidimensional measure commonly used to measure pain intensity. The scale is a measuring tool with length of 0-10 cm (0-100 mm). High scores on the scale indicate that pain intensity is high.</description>

    <description>The average score change on anxiety level as measured by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. This scale is used to measure anxiety. The scores on the scale ranges from 20 to 80. The high scores on the scale indicate that anxiety is high.</description>
