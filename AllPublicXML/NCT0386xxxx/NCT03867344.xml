  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a moderately low blood sugar stress on
      the nervous system. The investigators hope that information obtained from completing this
      study will help to reveal information about how a non-psychological stress impacts the parts
      of the brain that react to stress and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous
      system is the part of the nervous system that provides the body with involuntary or automatic
      control of heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing.

      Stress is common in daily life and is associated with adverse health outcomes. This proposal
      will study how a physiological stress (low blood sugar), a stress often experienced by people
      with diabetes, affects connections in the brain. The investigators will focus on brain
      connections that are involved in autonomic control of cardiovascular function, and determine
      both how these brain connections are altered by low blood sugar and how these alterations
      associate with changes in pain perception and cardiovascular control.

      In this study, the investigators introduce a novel mechanistic, integrative approach to the
      assessment of the response to and recovery from a specific physiologic stressor -
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The overall hypothesis is that a hypoglycemic stress will alter
      autonomic brain networks, and will affect clinically relevant physiological outcomes
      (cardiovascular autonomic function); and that the rate and extent of recovery of these brain
      networks will provide a measure of resilience.

      In combination, this approach will allow the investigators for the first time to define the
      magnitude of the effect of stress exposure on neural circuitry and on clinically relevant
      stress-related physiological outcomes (cardiovascular autonomic function) and to define the
      recovery of brain circuitry and these related physiological outcomes.

    <description>Functional MRI will be performed following physiological stress (hypoglycemia) or placebo (normoglycemia) and a functional connectivity analysis will be performed on the fMRI data. The outcome will be alterations in neural network connectivity, as measured by changes in Pearson-correlation coefficients among the following brain structures: right anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex; right anterior insula and hypothalamus; hypothalamus and anterior cingulate cortex; hypothalamus and amygdala; locus coeruleus and hypothalamus.</description>

    <description>The stress-induced change in baroreflex sensitivity (msec/mmHg) will be determined. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between the changes in baroreflex sensitivity and the changes in brain connectivity (right anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex; hypothalamus and amygdala [determined for the first outcome above]) will be calculated and tested for significance.</description>

    <ipd_description>The data collected will comply with the NIH requirements for timely release and data sharing. Data will be shared in the form of publications and presentations in scientific forums. As the NIH has noted, the investigators reserve the right to keep the data restricted in order to perform the initial analyses for this grant proposal and will continue to use the data for further, but not prolonged, exclusive use. Of note, the sharing of this data will be limited by at least the following issues, some unique to this proposal and some not unique. Some of the data obtained in this study is defined to be sensitive in nature, which may restrict its ability to be shared. Data may only be shared with the approval of our IRB and is limited by HIPPA and any other regulations that may be promulgated during the course of this proposal.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will be shared after completion of study and initial publications which we anticipate to be within 18 months of the final participant completing the study protocol.</ipd_time_frame>
