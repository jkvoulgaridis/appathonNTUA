    <description>Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity and specificity to RANKL, preventing the RANKL/RANK interaction from occurring and resulting in reduced osteoclast numbers and function, thereby decreasing bone resorption and cancer induced bone destruction.</description>

    <description>Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. Enzalutamide competitively inhibits binding of androgens to androgen receptors, inhibits nuclear translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with DNA even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens.
Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour regression.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained prior to any study-related procedures.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years and male.

          3. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          4. Histologically/cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and without
             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology.

          5. Documented metastatic disease with at least 1 bone metastasis on bone scan and
             confirmed, if necessary, by CT scan or MRI, if results of the bone scans are
             ambiguous. Patients with or without visceral involvement / lymph nodes (documented by
             RECIST 1.1) are allowed.

          6. Patients must have documented Progressive disease (PD) either by radiographic or PSA
             criteria as defined in a) and b) below:

               1. For the Radiographic PD assessment, 2 sets of scans using the same imaging
                  modality (ie CT/MRI or bone scan) and taken at separate time points are required
                  to document radiographic disease progression during or following the patient's
                  most recent anti-neoplastic therapy, (note: the 1st bone scan can be from before
                  most recent therapy but the 2nd scan must show disease progression during or
                  after the most recent therapy).

                  For patients with bone disease, progression will be assessed following
                  recommendations by the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG3) (Appendix I):
                  appearance of 2 or more new lesions on bone scan, confirmed, if necessary, by
                  other imaging modalities (such as CT scan or MRI), if results of the bone scans
                  are ambiguous).

                  For patients with soft tissue lesions progression will be assessed using RECIST
                  1.1 criteria, (see Appendix C). Patients may have measurable or non-measurable
                  disease according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 (see Appendix C)

               2. PSA progression as per PCWG3 (Appendix I) is defined as an increase in PSA, as
                  determined by 2 separate measurements taken at least 1 week apart and confirmed
                  by a third. If the third measurement is not greater than the second measurement,
                  then a fourth measurement must be taken and must be greater than the second
                  measurement for the patient to be eligible for the study. Furthermore, the
                  confirmatory PSA measurement (i.e. the third or, if applicable, fourth PSA
                  measurement) must be defined. If a patient has received prior anti-androgen
                  therapy (e.g. bicalutamide), PSA progression must be evident and documented after
                  discontinuation of anti-androgen therapy, (note: The 1st PSA reading taken to
                  document disease progression when the patient presents can be while the patient
                  is on Casodex or other ADT).

          7. Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration (e.g.
             GnRH analogue) with testosterone at screening less than 1.73 nmol /l (50ng/dL).

          8. Screening PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL.

          9. Patients must agree to:

               -  abstain from intercourse or

               -  if the patient engages in sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing
                  potential, a condom and a highly effective birth control must be used (i.e.
                  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine
                  device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal
                  occlusion or a vasectomy that has received medical assessment of the surgical
                  success) during treatment and for 5 months after treatment.

         10. Stable medical condition, including the absence of acute exacerbations of chronic
             illnesses, serious infections, or major surgery within 28 days prior to registration.

             psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere
             with participation in this study. Patients will be tested for hepatitis B or C or HIV
             infection during screening if they are considered by the investigator to be at higher
             risk for these infections and have not been previously tested, or if testing is
             required by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board.
