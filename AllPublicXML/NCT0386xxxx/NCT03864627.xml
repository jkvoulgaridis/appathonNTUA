        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 - 65 years of age (extremes included), on the day of signing
             the informed consent form (ICF).

          -  A BMI 18 - 40 kg/m², inclusive.

          -  Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis for at least one year since first diagnosis as per the
             Hanifin and Rajka Criteria.

          -  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥ 16 at the screening and at the baseline visit
             (Day 1 predose).

          -  Investigators' Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in which 3
             is moderate and 4 is severe) at the screening and baseline visits.

          -  Greater than or equal to 10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the
             screening and baseline visits.

          -  Willingness to use a non-medicated, simple bland emollient twice daily for at least 7
             days before the baseline visit and throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with MOR106.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any investigational medicinal product (IMP) ingredients as
             determined by the investigator (such as, but not limited to, anaphylaxis requiring
             hospitalisation).

          -  AD lesions located predominantly (≥ 50% of cumulative lesional area) on face and
             genital areas.

          -  Any concurrent illness, condition, disability, or clinically significant abnormality
             (including laboratory tests, a New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA)
             greater than or equal to III/IV) or clinically significant illness in the 3 months
             prior to initial IMP administration that, in the investigator's opinion, represents a
             safety risk for the subject's participation in the study, may affect the
             interpretation of clinical safety or efficacy data, or may prevent the subject from
             safely completing the assessments required by the protocol.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities at the discretion of the investigator detected on
             vital signs or physical examination (other than AD) at screening or baseline (Day 1
             predose).

          -  History of or a current immunosuppressive condition (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV] infection, as determined by a positive HIV test at screening).

          -  Active chronic or acute skin infection requiring treatment with systemic (oral, sc or
             iv) antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals within 4 weeks of baseline, or clinical
             signs of infective eczema within 7 days before baseline (Day 1 pre-dose).

          -  Having used any of the following treatments:

               -  Prior exposure to Dupilumab.

               -  Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs (e.g. systemic corticosteroids,
                  cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil, interferon (IFN)-γ, azathioprine,
                  methotrexate) within 4 weeks of baseline (Day 1) visit.

               -  Phototherapy (ultraviolet B [UVB] or Psoralen Ultraviolet A [PUVA]) for AD within
                  four weeks of baseline (Day 1) visit.

               -  Treatment with TCS or topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) within 7 days before
                  the baseline (Day 1) visit.

               -  Treatment with biologics within five half-lives (if known) or 12 weeks prior to
                  baseline visit, whichever is longer.

               -  Regular use (more than two visits per week) of a tanning booth/parlor within 4
                  weeks of the baseline visit.
