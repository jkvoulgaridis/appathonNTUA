  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of nasal carrying of SA ST398 strains in
      community and hospital settings, identify the factors associated with colonization of SA
      ST398, determine the distribution of imported and acquired cases among SA ST398 hospital
      cases and characterize the genetic structure of the ST398 SA population involved in
      colonization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a ubiquitous bacterium, part of the human commensal flora. The
      mucosa of the anterior nasal cavities represents the preferred site of colonization of SA.
      The SA ST398 clone, belonging to CC 398, was initially described as a zoonotic agent
      initially identified in France and the Netherlands. In fact, ST398 strains are separated into
      two distinct populations: a methicillin-resistant SA population (SAMR) with notion of contact
      with animals and a more virulent methicillin-sensitive SA population (SAMS) than its
      counterpart, isolated from serious human infections and without notion of exposure to farm
      animals. Recently, we have shown that, in SA bacteremia, all strains of SA ST398 are
      sensitive to methicillin and that the prevalence of ST398 among all SAMS responsible for
      bacteremia at Besançon University Hospital increased between 2009 and 2014, increased from 4
      to 15%. However, we were unable to study nasal colonization to support the mode of
      acquisition of SA ST398 (community vs. healthcare acquisition).
