  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of synthetic beta-arbutin, a dietary
      supplement that aids in the prevention and treatment of calcium oxalate kidney stones, when
      administered to healthy human subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective and purpose of this Phase I study is to investigate the safety of synthetic
      beta-arbutin, administered to healthy human subjects for: i) 12 weeks, at a dose of 150
      mg/day, and ii) 4 weeks, at a dose of 400mg/day. Safety will be determined by assessing
      adverse event rates between treatment groups and mean changes relative to baseline in serum
      biochemical, hematological and urinary markers.
