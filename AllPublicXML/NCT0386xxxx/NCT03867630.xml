  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous epidural neuroplasty (PEN) is an effective interventional treatment for
      radicular pain. But in some cases with wire catheter like Racz catheter, contrast runoffs
      were not shown to the foramen. This study will show that contrast runoff will affect the
      results of PEN and in cases which contrast runoff are not shown, additional transforaminal
      epidural blocks will affect the results of PEN by reviewing medical record, retrospectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical records will be investigated in cases of PEN with wire type catheter from May 2016 to
      August 2018. About one hundred cases will be enrolled. Analysis will be performed. It will be
      compared 1) Success rate of Runoff group and Nonrunoff group in lumbar spine, 2) Success rate
      of Runoff group and Nonrunoff-NonTransforaminal group in lumbar spine. 3) Success rate of
      Runoff group with nonrunoff-transforaminal group and Nonrunoff-NonTransforaminal group in
      lumbar spine. 4) Success rate of Nonrunoff-Transforaminal group and
      Nonrunoff-NonTransforaminal group in lumbar spine.

        Medical records will be reviewed retrospectively about 100 patients with chronic low back
        pain and lower extremity pain who did not respond to lumbar epidural steroid injections. As
        the next stage of treatment, percutaneous epidural neuroplasty with a wire type catheter is
        performed. The patient's symptoms, neurological examination, and imaging studies were
        evaluated to make a diagnosis. Patients 20 to 80 years old with a herniated disc, spinal
        stenosis are included. Percutaneous epidural neuroplasty using a wire type catheter was
        done, and patients had regular follow-up visits until 1 months after the neuroplasty.
