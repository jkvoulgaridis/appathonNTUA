  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out if consuming a single dose of blueberries, rich in anthocyanins,
      within an energy dense meal, improves blood vessel function and biomarkers of heart health.
      The study specifically aims to confirm if differences in how individuals process the
      bioactive compounds in blueberries, called anthocyanins, has an influence on heart health.
      The investigators will assess the effects of eating one portion of blueberries on vascular
      health over a 48hour period, and will track the breakdown compounds within blood and urine,
      to see if health effects are related to metabolism.

      The primary aim of this cross-over designed, placebo controlled, acute dietary intervention
      study, is to prospectively recruit participants on the basis of anthocyanin metabolism
      profiles (based on profiles confirmed in our previous studies) following a 'blueberry
      challenge'. Acute cardio and metabolic function responses will be assessed (by metaboliser
      profile), following an energy dense test meal with/without the addition of blueberries.

      Participants will be healthy, but overweight and obese (BMI inclusion: ≥ 25kg/m2) men and
      women (aged 50 y to 80 y), who will initially undertake a 'blueberry challenge' by consuming
      a single dose of freeze dried blueberries. Anthocyanin metaboliser type will be profiled from
      the analysis of metabolites within urine, collected for 48h following the 'challenge'.

      A total of 70 participants will complete the intervention (n=35 FAST and n=35 SLOW
      metabolisers) which consists of two, test meal periods (separated by at least 7d and
      allocated in random order); 1) energy dense test meal plus freeze dried blueberries, 2)
      energy dense test meal plus an isocaloric matched placebo material. Urine samples and
      ambulatory blood pressure measures will be collected for 24h prior to, and then over the 48h
      period which follows the test meal intake. Further assessment of vascular and metabolic
      function will be made at pre-defined times over the 48h postprandial period. Dietary
      restrictions to abstain from blueberries and reduce the anthocyanin intake level, will be
      applied for 5d before each test meal intake. In addition, all food and drink will be provided
      for a 4d period (2d before and during the 48h following the energy dense test meal) to
      further control the intake of flavonoids and to standardise the influence of background diet
      on metabolism profile.

    <intervention_model_description>Our research design involves screening individuals and then prospectively recruiting on the basis of two distinct blueberry metabolism profiles based on our previous research findings (in a population with metabolic syndrome). Our study will assess whether individuals with SLOW and FAST anthocyanin metabolism profiles respond differently and will test if the difference in processing may influence cardio metabolic responses. Our study involves feeding a single energy-dense meal which we anticipate will have a transient deleterious effect on acute markers of health. We will test whether adding blueberries to the energy dense meal improves acute responses compared against when adding the equivalent isocaloric amount of placebo. Participants will experience the blueberry and placebo treatments in random order</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The randomised allocation of treatment order for each participant will be performed by an independent researcher with experience in statistical randomisation. The Principle Investigator will receive notification of the treatment coding order for each subject (in a tamper-evident sealed envelope) which will be prepared by the independent researcher trained in statistics. The coding of the treatment randomisation will only be known to this researcher; and will only be broken at the analysis stage of the study unless a serious adverse event occurs. As the intervention material is a powdered food product, or placebo material, it is considered unlikely that this eventuality may occur.
During the analysis stage, a blind review of data quality and outlier data will be performed prior to unblinding. Researchers analysing the raw data will remain blind and the data will be locked prior to unblinding of the statistician (which will only occur after the completion of the statistical analysis).</masking_description>
