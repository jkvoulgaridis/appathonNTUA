  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of a future trial comparing the impact of
      a physical activity intervention and a standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme upon
      cardiovascular risk and symptoms in COPD. The study involved three groups which are physical
      activity group, pulmonary rehabilitation group and usual care. The physical activity group
      and the pulmonary rehabilitation group will complete six-weeks of intervention. The pulmonary
      rehabilitation group will participate in a standard rehabilitation programme of supervised
      exercise and education sessions. Physical activity group will be involved in a programme that
      aims to increase their physical activity level with an increasing step count. Usual care
      group will be monitored for six-weeks.

      Before and after interventions measures will be taken including exercise capacity, body
      composition, blood tests, arterial stiffness, questionnaires assessing health quality of
      life, anxiety and depression, symptoms, cardiovascular disease risk.

      The investigators will also have a sub-group study. The subgroup study will have two arms
      interventions which are pulmonary rehabilitation group and physical activity group. The
      investigators will recruit 10 participants for each group from the main groups' population
      (no usual care group). Additional before and after measures will be taken for sub-group study
      and that includes Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning for adipose visceral tissue and
      postprandial lipaemic response test.

      It is hypothesised that exercise and physical activity level can reduce cardiovascular
      disease risk with COPD patients, but the relative impact of both interventions need to be
      explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For those with COPD, both physical activity (PA) interventions and pulmonary rehabilitation
      (PR) seem to be promising to potentially lower the risk of CVD. PA interventions seem to be
      promising in improving outcomes of COPD but there is lack of evidence on how the
      effectiveness of PA interventions compared with the gold standard intervention of PR.

      However, the outcomes of both interventions have not been extensively investigated, nor have
      they been directly compared. The immediate effects of pulmonary rehabilitation and PA
      interventions on cardiovascular risk factors for individuals with COPD have not been
      extensively investigated or compared.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of conducting a trial to
      compare the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation and physical activity interventions in a
      number of important clinical outcomes including cardiovascular risk.

      Investigation and data collection will be taking place within University Hospitals of
      Leicester NHS trust sites. The investigators are aiming to recruit 50 COPD patients who are
      eligible for a pulmonary rehabilitation programme to investigate the effect of physical
      activity intervention compared to pulmonary rehabilitation with respect to cardiovascular
      risks.

      The study will measure various outcomes, immediately before, immediately after interventions.
      These outcomes will include measures in aerobic fitness (walking test), strength tests,
      physical activity level, quality of life, breathlessness questionnaires. In addition, blood
      sampling and body measurements will be completed. The investigators will also measure
      arterial stiffness with a non-invasive technique. Arterial stiffness is a hardening of the
      artery wall.

      In a subgroup study, 20 participants will have additional visits and measures. The
      investigators will be doing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diagnostic pictures of the
      inside of the body which is used for picturing the fat tissue around the abdomen. The
      investigators will be also doing a postprandial lipaemic test which is testing the fat level
      in the circulating blood after a high-fat meal. The investigators will do this test as before
      and after the intervention to allow for comparison.
