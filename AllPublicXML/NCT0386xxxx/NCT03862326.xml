  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incontinence is a world wide challenge especially in elderly women. The participation in
      pelvic floor exercises can to some extent help women with urinary incontinency. In the
      Municipality of Aalborg in Denmark, the citizens can get a diaper grant, if they are
      incontinence. The project will be recruiting women with diaper grants and randomly allocate
      the women to 3 different groups 1) Group training (usual care), 2) Individual training and 3)
      Individual training with biofeedback in the form of ultrasound. All groups will receive the
      same incontinence education from the incontinence nurses and physiotherapists. The Women will
      be offered 6 individual or 10 group base trainings, with increased time between trainings, to
      increase the participants independency and rely more on home based exercises.
