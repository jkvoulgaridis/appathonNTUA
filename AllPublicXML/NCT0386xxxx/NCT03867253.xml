  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa study assessing the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      ORY-2001 in mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group and multicenter study with
      a placebo-controlled 24-week treatment period followed by a no placebo-controlled 24-week
      extension period.

      It is planned to randomise 25 patients. In the double-blind placebo-controlled treatment
      period, all patients will be randomized between two doses of ORY-2001 and placebo. In the
      double-blind no placebo-controlled extension period, patients in the placebo arm will be
      re-allocated in one of the two different dose levels of ORY-2001. Randomization will be
      stratified by cognitive impairment severity.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review un-blinded safety data throughout
      the study.
