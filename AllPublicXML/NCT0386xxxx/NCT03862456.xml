  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether, in patients with non treated
      periodontitis (stage III and IV) positive to Porphyromonas gingivalis, the use of systemic
      antimicrobials (metronidazole versus azithromycin) as an adjunctive treatment to periodontal
      surgery provides clinical and microbiological benefits.

      Design: randomized, parallel and triple blind clinical trial

      Sample: Patients with periodontitis (stages III and IV) and positive to Porphyromonas
      gingivalis who potentially need periodontal surgery were recruited. 25 patients were
      randomized to the test group (periodontal surgery + azithromycin) and another 25 subjects to
      the control group (periodontal surgery + metronidazole).

      Study visits:

        -  Examiner calibration

        -  Recruitment of patients. Screening. Data collection (clinical and microbiological
           variables).

        -  Phase I.

             -  Non-surgical periodontal treatment (2 visits).

             -  Reevaluation at 6 weeks. Data collection (clinical and microbiological variables).
                Identification of study candidate patients (Patients with probing pocket depth &gt; 5
                mm and positive to Porphyromonas gingivalis). Randomization of study groups.

        -  Phase II. Surgical periodontal treatment.

             -  Periodontal surgery sessions. In the last surgery, the antibiotic test
                (azithromycin) or metronidazole (control) is administered according to
                randomization.

             -  Suture removal 1 week after performing periodontal surgery. Data collection 1 week
                after antibiotic consumption with the last surgery (patient-centered variables on
                the side effects of antibiotics).

             -  Re-evaluation of the surgical phase at 6 weeks after the last surgery session. Data
                collection (clinical variables).

        -  Phase III. Periodontal maintenance.

             -  Maintenance 1 (3 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and
                microbiological variables).

             -  Maintenance 2 (6 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and
                microbiological variables).

             -  Maintenance 3 (9 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical variables).

             -  Maintenance 4 (12 months post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and
                microbiological variables).

             -  Maintenance 5 (4 years post surgery). Data collection (Clinical and microbiological
                variables).

    <masking_description>The subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment groups in ascending order according to a balanced distribution system through a computer generated random number design table (random block design). Randomization was balanced according to the smoking habit at the initial visit to ensure homogeneity in the treatment groups.
The method of allocation concealment selected were opaque envelopes. The research coordinator was responsible for the randomization and allocation of patients.
The 50 opaque envelopes (25 / group) were prepared.</masking_description>
