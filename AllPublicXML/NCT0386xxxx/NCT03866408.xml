  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These studies will define the abnormalities in the adipocyte proteins that are involved in
      the failure of insulin to suppress lipolysis normally in humans with upper body obesity and
      will help discover the mechanism by which pioglitazone, a medication used to treat type 2
      diabetes and improve insulin resistance, improves insulin-regulation of adipocyte fatty acid
      metabolism.

      1. The investigators will determine whether impaired insulin-induced suppression of
           lipolysis (as measured by IC50) is related to the above mentioned lipolysis proteins in
           groups of volunteers known to vary widely with regards to abdominal adipocyte size and
           regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis.

        2. The investigators will determine whether the improved insulin regulation of lipolysis
           resulting from treatment with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone, with or without weight
           loss, can be linked to specific changes in sets of PPARγ-responsive adipocyte lipolysis
           proteins in UBO adults.
