  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the pathologic response at 12 months after single dose
      preoperative partial breast irradiation in early stage breast cancer patients. Furthermore,
      the aim is to collect data on response monitoring. Patient-reported outcome measures and
      treatment-induced toxicity will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center single arm interventional cohort study 70 patients will be treated with
      single dose preoperative partial breast irradiation (PBI). Breast conserving surgery will be
      performed 12 months following PBI to assess pathologic response. Response monitoring
      following PBI includes MRI (3T and 7T), liquid biopsies and biopsy of the irradiated tumor.

      Results from this trial can change the current treatment of patients with early stage breast
      cancer. The single dose PBI can be of benefit for all patients who are suitable for
      postoperative PBI according to current guidelines. If pathologic complete response can be
      accurately predicted by (one of) the abovementioned response monitoring modalities, the need
      for surgery will become disputable. Moreover, in patients without expected pathologic
      complete response, the burden of radiotherapy can be minimized from 3-4.5 weeks of
      radiotherapy to a single dose of radiotherapy.
