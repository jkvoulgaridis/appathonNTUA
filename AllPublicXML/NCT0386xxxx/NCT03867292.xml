  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. The lumbar region is one of the locations with the highest incidence of
      injuries in the paddle players. The crossed hands myofascial technique is used to release the
      restrictions of the thoracolumbar fascia, improving its mobility. The electrotherapy
      technique of TENS consists in the application of a low frequency current for the recovery,
      capitalization and oxygenation of the muscle, thus improving mobility and pain.

      Aim. To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention by electrotherapy combined with myofascial
      therapy, in the lumbar region, for a mobility improvement in older paddle-tennis federated
      players.

      Study design. Randomized, multicenter, simple blind, clinical trial with follow-up period.

      Methods. 30 players paddle will be assigned to the two study groups: experimental
      (intervention through therapy myofascial and electrotherapy) and control (intervention by
      electrotherapy). The intervention will have a duration of 4 weeks, with 2 sessions per week,
      lasting 15 minutes. There will be three evaluations: pre-intervention, post-intervention and
      follow-up. The variable of study is the mobility of the lumbar spine in the movements of
      flexion and extension (assessed by the employment of tests of Schober and
      Fingertip-to-floor). The analysis of normality be performed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnof, and
      in case of homogeneity of the groups is used in parametric tests: test t-student for paired
      data (difference between the different assessments) and ANOVA of mean repeated (intra-and
      intersujeto).

      Expected results. Improvement of the mobility of the lumbar spine in the movements of flexion
      and extension.

    <description>Low back flexion will be measured with the Schober test. The subject will remain standing and the evaluator will mark an imaginary line that connects both posterior superior iliac spines (near the Venus pits). A second mark will be placed 10 cm above the first mark and, finally, we will make a third mark 5 cm below the first mark. Next, the subject will be asked to bend to the maximum, keeping the knees extended. When the maximum flexion is reached, the increase in the distance between the skin marks will be measured. The unit of measurement is the centimeter (the greater the distance, the greater the mobility in the flexion of the lumbar spine).</description>

A second mark will be placed 10 cm above the first mark and, finally, we will make a third mark 5 cm below the first mark. Next, the subject will be asked to lean back to the maximum, keeping the knees extended. When the maximum extension is reached, the decrease in the distance between the skin marks will be measured. The unit of measurement is the centimeter (at a lower distance, greater mobility in extension of the lumbar spine).</description>

    <description>Low back flexion will be measured with the Fingertip-to-floor test. With the subject standing on a platform 20 cm high (without shoes and with their feet together), you will be asked to lean towards flexion, while keeping your knees, arms and fingers fully extended. The vertical distance between the tip of the middle finger and the platform shall be measured with a flexible measuring tape and expressed in centimeters. The vertical distance (measured in centimeters) between the platform and the tip of the middle finger will be positive when the subject does not reach the platform and negative when it can go further.</description>

    <description>The aim of the application of the crossed hands technique is to produce a deep fascial release, placing the subject in prone position, while the standing physiotherapist will contact with one hand on the spine at the level of the thoracolumbar hinge and with the other hand on the sacrum, so that the hands are crisscrossed. The crossed hands technique will be performed between 90 seconds and 5 minutes.
The application of the TENS, will be performed for 10 minutes by means of a device, model Compex in the lumbar area, subjects will receive a TENS application of low frequency (less than 40Hz). The electrode - (black) in proximal position or on the most painful zone. The electrode + (red) will be placed distally.</description>
