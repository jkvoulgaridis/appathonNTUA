  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic error and delay remain a leading cause of preventable harm and death in the United
      States. Using a learning laboratory structure, researchers will implement mixed-methods
      research approaches to identify the systemic weaknesses that contribute to diagnostic error
      and delay in the hospital setting. The knowledge gained from research innovative will allow
      researchers to design, develop, implement, and refined a suite of human-centered tools that
      can be deployed to reduce the risk of diagnostic error and delay in both community and
      academic hospital settings.

    <textblock>
      Despite the recognition that diagnostic errors an delays are a major contributor to
      preventable deaths in the USA, little progress has been made to reduce mortality outcomes
      from this known killer. An effective strategy leading to meaningful reduction in diagnostic
      error and delay rates has not made its way into practice. This proposal is unique and novel
      and combines mixed-methods research approaches with systems engineering research approaches
      to understand the interplay of the multiple factors contributing to diagnostic error and
      delay. The knowledge gained from this holistic approach will then be used within the learning
      laboratory to inform the design, development, evaluation, and refinement of the solutions to
      diagnostic error and delay. &quot;Control Tower&quot; will be the staging ground for the in situ
      learning laboratory and will be built on top of a well-established clinical informatics
      infrastructure and hospital environment open to innovation and practice change.

        1. All patients at risk of diagnostic error will be eligible for the study.

          2. We will include both sexes and all genders and all minority populations as they
             present with the risk of diagnostic error in the hospitals.

        Given the nature of the study, which focuses on patients with or at risk of diagnostic
        error, outreach efforts to underrepresented populations or individuals would not be
        possible.
