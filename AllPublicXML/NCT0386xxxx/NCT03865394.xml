  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate efficiency of applying of adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells (ADSC) in treatment of chronic wounds in diabetic foot syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The product will contain an active ingredient- human autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells (ADSC) cells suspended in the fibrin solution applied directly onto prepared wound
      bed, to form thin gel layer on the wound surface.

             and acceptance for procedures related with its implementation

          4. Chronic wound in the course of diabetic foot syndrome, with duration of at least 12
             weeks and the wound surface not less than 2 sq. cm and not greater than 25 sq. cm,
             without evidence of active infection of the wound at the time of qualification to
             participate in the study

          5. Satisfactory blood glucose control - fasting not more than 110 mg%, HbA1c &lt;6.5%

          6. Good tolerance of the current standard of treatment lasting at least one week before
             including the patient into the study

          7. Satisfactory blood supply to the wound verified by the measurement of the oxygen level
             of the foot tissue (&gt; 20mmHg) in patients with neuropathic etiology of diabetic foot
             syndrome

          8. In the case of the patients with the wounds of ischemic component, the condition for
             qualification is a clinical improvement of the limb's blood supply as a result of the

         10. No active infection of the wound and surrounding tissue verified by quantitative
             microbiological testing (105 bacteria per 1 g of tissue taken for testing from a

             carried out during the screening visit (blood type, morphology, electrolytes,
             coagulation system, blood glucose, urea, creatinine, and viral tests). Test results
             behind laboratory standards for a specific parameter are considered as incorrect. In
             the case of treatment with vitamin K antagonists, normal ranges suitable for this
             treatment will apply.
