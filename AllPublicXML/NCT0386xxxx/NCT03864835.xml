      This research is being done to find out if aerobic exercise is beneficial in reversing
      scarring. Physical activity has been shown to increase fitness in healthy individuals as well
      as in those with NASH. This research will allow for better understanding the effects of
      physical activity on fitness and endothelial function in patients with NASH with the goal of
      reversing scarring.

      Approximately 12 people will take part in this research study at Penn State (PSU) Milton S.
      Hershey Medical Center (HMC), Penn State Physical Medicine &amp; Research (PM&amp;R) Laboratories
      housed at the Hershey Center for Applied Research (HCAR) and the Penn State University
      Fitness Center (UFC).

      Preliminary studies show universally low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in Nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH) patients was dependent on body composition. The proposed work is based
      on the hypothesis that gains in cardiorespiratory fitness and improved endothelial function
      achieved through exercise can arrest or reverse progression of hepatic fibrosis, lessen
      cardiovascular disease risk (CVD), and improve all-cause mortality in patients with NASH. The
      aims of this research proposal are designed to characterize and better understand the effects
      of physical activity (PA) on CRF and endothelial function in patients with NASH. The goal is
      to arrest progression of fibrosis and reduce CVD risk. This proposal includes a
      cross-sectional study and a small pilot clinical trial in a high-risk subgroup of NASH most
      likely to benefit from PA.

    <description>The diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is defined by the presence and pattern of specific histological abnormalities on liver biopsy. A separate system of scoring the features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NA) called the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) was developed as a tool to measure changes in NAFLD. The grading or NAFLD activity score (NAS) encompasses steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning.</description>

    <description>All subjects will undergo DXA and CRF measurement (relative VO2max) under the supervision of an American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)-certified fitness professional and study physician at the Penn State PM&amp;R Research Laboratories. Subjects selected for the interventional pilot trial will receive a FitBit Charge2 HR and be instructed on how to use a FitBit Hear Rate monitor, Fitbit application, Fitbit website, and Fitabase (secure data management platform utilized by &gt;400 clinical trials). Participants will record their daily food and beverage intake through the Fitbit app. Individualized feedback will be provided by a registered dietician (RD). Subjects that meet requirements for the exercise arm (12 total) will be required to exercise 30 minutes, five days per week at a moderate intensity (HR target corresponding to 45-55% of their relative VO2max). Each session will be supervised in-person at the Penn State University Fitness Center with an ACSM certified exercise physiologist.</description>

Each session will be supervised in-person at the Penn State University Fitness Center with an ACSM certified exercise physiologist. This is feasible as Zhang et al.(87) found 66 out of 70 subjects (95%) completed the twelve-month supervised in-person moderate-intensity exercise protocol five-days a week.</description>
