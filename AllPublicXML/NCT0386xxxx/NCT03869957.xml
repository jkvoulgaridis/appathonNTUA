  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of parenteral
      nutrition (PN) supplemented with lipid emulsions containing 0.1-0.2 g omega 3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (n-3 PUFA)/kg body weight/day for 7 days on malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, a
      marker of lipoperoxidation of reactive species, compared with a control group (without n-3
      PUFA) in patients with intestinal failure (IF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IF is the loss of intestinal function that affects the decrease in the absorption of
      macronutrients, water, and electrolytes, so it requires intravenous supplementation such as
      PN and/or intravenous fluids to maintain health and/or growth. IF type II is associated with
      complex infectious and metabolic complications and patients require PN for weeks or months.
      Long-term PN use, however, includes the risk of complications, among which a serious one is
      the intestinal failure-associated liver disease (1). It has been proposed that metabolic
      endotoxemia (2-3), inflammation (4) and oxidative stress (5) are involved in the development
      of this intestinal failure-associated liver disease.

      Although some studies have reported beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA to prevent and reverse the
      liver disease associated with IF (6-7), due to its antioxidant (8-10) and anti-inflammatory
      activity (11-12) and in the modulation of the intestinal microbiota (13), the literature on
      the use of n-3 PUFA in non-critical patients with IF and PN is limited and the results have
      not been conclusive.

      Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of PN
      supplemented with lipid emulsions containing n-3 PUFA/kg body weight/day for 7 days on
      oxidative stress (concentrations of MDA), compared with a control group (without n-3 PUFA)
      will be performed.

Once the treatment group is determined, the PN will be prescribed accordingly and the preparation will be carried out in the pharmacy and it will have the same appearance in both arms. Patients and researchers who will evaluate the outcomes and perform the statistical analysis will be blinded to the assigned group.</masking_description>
