    <textblock>
      CO40939 is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study designed to evaluate the
      safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of cibisatamab in combination with
      atezolizumab administered after pretreatment with obinutuzumab in patients with Stage IV
      microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) whose tumors have high
      carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) expression and who have
      progressed on two or more chemotherapy regimens. The study is composed of a safety run-in and
      an exploratory part.
