  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children sometimes need dental procedures which can be painful and associated with child pain
      and anxiety. In addition to pain medication, distraction may help children cope with the
      pain. This may include interacting with books, TV, toys or videogames.

      Virtual Reality (VR) is an immersive experience using sight, sound, and position sense. Using
      VR may enhance distraction during the painful procedure and may reduce attention to pain.

      This study will randomize children (4 - 16 years old) to receive Virtual Reality or standard
      of care in addition to local anesthetics during dental procedures. Pain, anxiety and
      satisfaction will be measured as well as the amount of analgesics used and the timing of the
      procedure. Outcome measures will be compared between the two groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Procedure Pain using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain is reported by children immediately following completion of the procedure (within two minutes post-procedure). This scale should take less than one minute to complete</time_frame>
    <description>Level of pain as reported by children using Faces Pain Scale - Revised. The scale includes six faces that represent progressively more intense features of pain. Children point to the face that best represents their current level of pain. The minimum score is 0 (representing least pain) and the maximum score is 10 (representing greater pain). The scale increase in increments of 2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Local Anesthetic Pain using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain is reported by children immediately following injection of the local anesthetic (within two minutes post-injection). This scale should take less than one minute to complete</time_frame>

    <measure>Anxiety using the Venham Situational Anxiety Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Anxiety is reported by children immediately following completion of the procedure (within two minutes post-procedure). This scale should take less than one minute to complete</time_frame>
    <description>Level of Situational Anxiety as reported by children using the Venham Situational Anxiety Score. This scale includes 8 sets of 2 images of children which represent differing levels of anxiety. Children point to the child that best represents them in that instance. In each set of 2 images of children, one represents greater anxiety (scored as 1) and one represents lesser anxiety (scored as 0). The points from each set of images are totaled. The minimum score is 0 (least anxious) and maximum score is 8 (most anxious).</description>

    <measure>Co-operation of the child as measured by the Dentist on 100mm VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Co-operation is rated immediately following completion of the dental visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The dentist will rate their impression of the level of co-operation by the child on a 100 mm VAS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction determined qualitatively by an open ended question</measure>
    <time_frame>Satisfaction question is reported by children immediately following completion of the dental procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction from the procedure is determined qualitatively. Children are asked &quot;What is your opinion on how the procedure went?&quot; Answers will be recorded in writing and be assessed for themes (similar words, positive or negative language).</description>

    <measure>Parent Satisfaction determined qualitatively by an open ended question</measure>
