  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and the intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)
      changes of using NaviFUS System for the treatment of patients with drug resistant epilepsy.

      This is a phase I, two-stage, prospective, open label, single center, and single-arm study.
      Eligible patients will be enrolled through the process of informed consent then will receive
      NaviFUS treatment one cycle. The time interval for each treatment cycle is 3 days, including
      baseline/treatment and 3 days observation. The site of the NaviFUS exposure is where the
      future surgery will be removed. Concomitantly use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) will be
      monitored and recorded in the case report form (CRF). A total of six patients will be divided
      into two stages of recruitment, the first stage will recruit two patients, the second stage
      will be four patients. When the first stage is accomplished, the data and safety monitoring
      board (DSMB) will review the study data and provide the recommendations regarding
      continuation, termination, or other modifications of the study based on evaluation of
      observed adverse effects of the intervention. The second stage will begin to conduct after
      the DSMB agrees to proceed. In this clinical trial, stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)
      exploration will be carried out during long-term video-EEG monitoring and
      excitability/irritability in focal epileptogenic region and epileptogenic network will be
      analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged 20 years and older

          2. Patients with drug resistant epilepsy (have failed treatment with at least two
             appropriate anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) due to lack of efficacy) who hospitalized and
             underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) implantation for localization and
             delineation of epileptogenic focus for removing by surgery.

          3. Seizure frequency is countable and available at least one month prior to study.

          4. Willing and able to sign written informed consent and be able to comply with the study
             protocol for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with concurrent active psychiatric or mood disorders that in the opinion of
             the investigator would interfere with participation in the study

          2. Patients have significant bleeding after SEEG implantation

          3. Presence of pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), permanent
             medication pumps, cochlear implants, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), or deep brain
             stimulation (DBS)

          4. The skull bone area traversed by the sonication pathway is covered by scars, scalp
             disorders (e.g., eczema), or atrophy of the scalp

          5. Clips or other metallic implanted objects in the FUS exposure path, except shunts

          6. Abnormal coagulation profile: Platelet (PLT) &lt; 100,000/Î¼L, prothrombin time (PT) &gt;14
             sec or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) &gt;36 sec, and international
             normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.3

          7. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

             of its components

         10. Use of any recreational drugs or history of drug addiction or known history of
             substance or alcohol abuse

         12. Any other condition that, in the investigator's judgment, might affect study endpoints
             or might increase the risk to the patients or decrease the chance of obtaining
             satisfactory data needed to achieve the objectives of the study
