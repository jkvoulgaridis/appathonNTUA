      The study purpose is to collect images and user feedback from the Next Generation Venue
      Ultrasound system, components, and accessories under clinical conditions, as required for
      device development and optimization.

      Adult patients (aged &gt;18 years) will be enrolled that present for emergency or immediate
      medical care, in facilities such as the intensive care unit (ICU), US unit, and/or other
      departments. Subjects may or may not have a clinical indication for ultrasound scanning as
      part of their regular medical care and will be required to meet the inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria. If a subject has a clinical indication for ultrasound exam,
      the routine exam will be performed with the standard equipment, and an additional exam will
      be performed using the investigational ultrasound device.

             devices;

          3. Require or are anticipated to require medical care where study participation could
             reasonably be expected to adversely impact patient care.
