  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) identified an association between a loss of
      function variant in the human alpha 2B adrenergic receptor gene and trigeminal nerve
      disorders. Guanfacine is the oldest alpha-2 adrenergic agonist in clinical use and is
      approved for hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We hypothesize that
      guanfacine will be an effective adjunct to lidocaine for the treatment of neuropathic pain by
      enhancing and prolonging pain relief due to its activation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.
      The objectives of the study will be to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guanfacine in
      combination with lidocaine for trigeminal nerve block procedures for pain management in
      trigeminal neuralgia patients. This study will evaluate the efficacy of guanfacine in
      reducing acute pain and extending duration of pain relief when delivered in combination with
      lidocaine as a trigeminal nerve block, measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) data collected
      at specific time points after each injection.

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health version 1.2 [health-related quality of life] includes 10 questions and measures assess an individual's physical, mental, and social health. The adult PROMIS Global Health measure produces two scores: Physical Health and Mental Health. All items, except for the rating of pain, use a 1-5 rating, with higher ratings corresponding with better outcomes. The pain item will be recoded from a 1-10 scale to convert to a 1-5 scale, with higher ratings corresponding to better outcomes. The remaining two items (general health and social roles) are not used to calculate summary scores; these two questions use a 1-5 rating, with higher ratings corresponding with better outcomes. The raw scores for Physical Health and Mental Health will comprise a sum of the numerical responses for the four questions in each group. T scores will be calculated, with higher T scores corresponding with better outcomes.</description>
