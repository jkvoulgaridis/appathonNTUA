  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, 25% of the adults are affected by metabolic syndrome (NHS, 2016). Metabolic
      syndrome is a cluster of different conditions including: hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance
      hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Such individuals also have increased
      risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The factors contributing to
      the development of metabolic syndrome are potentially numerous and understudied in humans,
      with much of what we think we know coming from animal research. Recent animal studies have
      pointed towards gut health playing a role in metabolic health. More specifically it has been
      suggested that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota may drive insulin resistance
      and type 2 diabetes through a mechanism that is linked to increased gut permeability and the
      development of metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation. Yet, this link has not been confirmed
      in humans. This research will look at the relationship between diet, physical activity,
      sleeping patterns, obesity status and age etc. and measures of gut bacterial composition, gut
      barrier function and metabolic health. Findings will provide us with new insights on the
      effect of different physiological and behavioural/ lifestyle variables on gut health and
      metabolic function.
