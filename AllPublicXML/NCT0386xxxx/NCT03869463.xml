    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the benefits and mechanism of action of computerized
      cognitive training (CCT) on mood, neuropsychological deficits, everyday functioning, and
      brain activity among young adults with a range of depressive symptoms.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in WAIS-IV Symbol Search</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 4, 8, 3-month follow- up</time_frame>

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in DKEFS Letter and Category Naming Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 4, 8, 3-month follow- up</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of verbal fluency. This test requires subjects to generate words that begin with a particular letter or belong to a particular semantic category as quickly as possible. Total score is the number of words generated in 60 seconds per trial.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in California Verbal Learning Test-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 4, 8, 3-month follow- up</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of short-term and long-term verbal memory. For this test, the participant is read a list of words five times. He/she is asked to recall what was on the list immediately after each reading of the list. After a delay, the participant is again asked to recall what words were on the list.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised</measure>

             duration.

        4. Willing and able to complete MRI, mood, and neuropsychological testing. 5. IQ &gt; 85.

             disorder.

          3. Active suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, or past attempt within 1 year.

          4. Severe depression (HDRS &gt; 30).

          5. Neurological disorder (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, clinical
             stroke).

          6. Use of medications known to have negative impact on cognition (benzodiazepines and

          8. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, acutely ill patients (including
             those with metastases) are excluded, but past history of successfully treated cancer
             does not result in exclusion.

          9. Regular online brain training or regular player of non-fluency verbal games, defined
             as doing these procedures at a frequency of twice weekly or greater during the year
