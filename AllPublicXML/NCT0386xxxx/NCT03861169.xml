  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively assess the clinical effect of ab‐interno transluminal
      viscoelastic delivery and trabeculotomy performed using the OMNI Surgical System in
      combination with Cataract Extraction on intraocular pressure (IOP) and the use of
      IOP‐lowering medications in patients with mild‐moderate open angle glaucoma (OAG).

      This prospective, multicenter, single‐arm, post‐market clinical study will evaluate the
      impact of ab‐interno transluminal viscoelastic delivery and trabeculotomy using OMNI Surgical
      System in conjunction with cataract surgery on IOP and the use of hypotensive medications in
      patients with mild to moderate open angle glaucoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - (only one eye of each subject is eligible, and all ocular criteria apply to the study
        eye):

          1. Male or female subjects, 22 years or older.

          2. Visually significant cataract

          3. Diagnosed with mild to moderate open angle glaucoma (e.g. primary open angle glaucoma,
             pigmentary glaucoma, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma) per AAO/AGS/ICD‐10 Glaucoma Stage
             Definitions.1

          4. At screening, on 1‐3 IOP‐lowering medications2 with a medicated IOP ≤25 mmHg OR on
             zero (0) IOP‐lowering medications with an IOP 21‐30 mmHg.

          5. At baseline, unmedicated diurnal IOP 21‐30 mmHg and, for subjects who were medicated
             at screening, IOP at least 3 mmHg higher than screening IOP.

          6. Scheduled for cataract extraction followed by abinterno transluminal viscoelastic
             delivery and trabeculotomy using the OMNI Surgical System.

          7. Shaffer grade of ≥ III in all four quadrants

          8. Potential of good best corrected visual acuity post cataract extraction, in the
             investigator's judgment

          9. Able and willing to comply with the protocol, including all follow‐up visits.

         10. Understands and signs the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - (All criteria apply to the study eye; both eyes of a single subject need not be
        eligible):

          1. Any of the following prior treatments for glaucoma:

               -  Laser trabeculoplasty ≤3 months prior to baseline

               -  iStent implanted ≤6 months prior to baseline

               -  Implanted with Cypass, Xen, Express, glaucoma draining device/valve, or Hydrus
                  Device

               -  Prior canaloplasty, goniotomy, trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, ECP or CPC

          2. Normal tension glaucoma

          3. Acute angle closure, traumatic, congenital, malignant, uveitic or neovascular glaucoma

          4. Severe glaucoma by AAO/AGS/ICD‐10 guideline

          5. Use of oral hypotensive medication treatment for glaucoma

          6. History of elevated IOP due to steroid response

          7. In the investigator's judgement, predisposed to significant risk because of washout of
             ocular hypotensive medications.

          8. Ocular pathology or medical condition which, in the investigator's judgment, would
             either place the subject at increased risk of complications, contraindicate surgery,
             place the subject at risk of significant vision loss during the study period (e.g.,
             wet AMD, corneal edema, Fuch's dystrophy, etc.), or interfere with compliance to
             elements of the study protocol (e.g., returning to investigator's office for follow‐up
             visits).

          9. Participation (≤ 30 days prior to baseline) in an interventional trial which could
             have a potential effect on the study outcome, as determined by the study investigator.
