      PURPOSE:

      The main objectives of the study are:

        1. To find the efficacy of using cognitive behavioural therapy on chronic low back pain
           with central sensitization.

        2. To assist in planning an ideal physical therapy rehabilitation program for these
           patients.

      BACKGROUND:

      Recent research has shown that CLBP is a multifactorial disorder comprising psychosocial
      factors like pain catastrophization, fear avoidance and central sensitization. Central
      sensitization has been defined as &quot;An amplification of neural signaling within the central
      nervous system that elicits pain hypersensitivity&quot;, and &quot;increased responsiveness of
      nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent
      input&quot;.

      Maladaptive behavior, false beliefs and misinformation regarding the cause of the pain are
      all contributing factors to the chronicity of LBP.

      Central sensitization has been attributed to cortical reorganization and amplification of the
      somatosensory representation of the back causing increased pain and further contributing to
      the maladaptive behavior and beliefs.

      Cognitive behavioral treatment has been an important intervention for psychological disorders
      for decades and recently has gained a lot of interest as an intervention for chronic pain in
      general and CLBP in specific.

      HYPOTHESES:

      It will be hypothesized that: Cognitive behavioural therapy will have a significant effect on
      centrally sensitized pain intensity and disability.

      RESEARCH QUESTION:&quot; Does cognitive behavioral therapy have a significant effect on chronic
      low back pain with central sensitization&quot;

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is one of the most commonly used outcome measures for individuals with low back pain (LBP) (Fairbank JC, 2000) .The ODI shows good construct validity; internal consistency is rated as acceptable; test-retest reliability and responsiveness have been shown to be high; and burden of administration is low. The ODI is a self-administered questionnaire that requires 5 minutes to complete and 1 minute to score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>FABQ was developed by Waddell to investigate fear-avoidance beliefs among LBP patients in the clinical setting. This survey can help predict those that have a high pain avoidance behavior. The FABQ consists of 2 subscales, which are reflected in the division of the outcome form into 2 separate sections. The first subscale (items 1-5) is the Physical Activity subscale (FABQPA), and the second subscale (items 6-16) is the Work subscale (FABQW). Scoring the Physical Activity subscale (FABQPA) Sum items 2, 3, 4, and 5 (the score circled by the patient for these items). Scoring the Work subscale (FABQW) Sum items 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The numerical rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS evaluates levels of pain intensity using an 11-point scale (range 0-10), with 0 being classified as &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;pain as bad as could be.&quot; Pain evaluation was assessed verbally by having people report pain intensity for the last 7 days as a criterion for inclusion in the study.</description>

    <description>Following assessment a one on one session will be given comprising education cognitively targeting false ideas and beliefs on the nature of pain, differentiating nociception due to a painful stimulus and the transition of such a stimulus to a centrally sensitized experience due to misinformation, maladaptive behaviour and fear avoidance. Upon completion of the session assessment using the NPQ will be done to assess the understanding of the patient and further address any shortcomings in future exercise sessions.
Another SEMG recording of the Flexion Relaxation phenomenon will be upon completion of the educational session and a SEMG biofeedback session will begin to help the patient regain their sense of control over their body and function.
After the SEMG biofeedback session a graded exposure exercise program of strengthening and functional training starting from the least feared movements to the most over 10 sessions over 5 weeks.</description>
