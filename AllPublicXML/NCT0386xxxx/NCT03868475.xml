      This randomized controlled trial compares vacuum-assisted percutaneous excision to open
      standard surgical excision in women who have high-risk or borderline, non-malignant breast
      lesions with respect to efficacy, safety, cosmesis and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In women diagnosed with high-risk or borderline, non-malignant breast lesions, is
      vacuum-assisted percutaneous excision (VAPE) comparable to open standard surgical excision
      with respect to efficacy, safety, cosmesis and patient satisfaction?

      With the increase in breast imaging for screening there has been corresponding rise in
      detection of high-risk/borderline, non-malignant breast lesions that require surgical
      excision to confirm diagnosis and rule out underlying malignancy. Image-guided
      vacuum-assisted percutaneous excision (VAPE) could offer an alternative to standard open
      surgical excision for complete excision of these lesions with a possible improvement in
      patient satisfaction and cosmetic outcomes and decreased complications.

      In this single-centre, non-inferiority designed prospective randomized, open label controlled
      trial, women over 18 years who are found to have a borderline or high-risk, non-malignant
      breast lesions on core needle biopsy will be considered eligible. Exclusion criteria will be
      women with a greater than 25% lifetime risk of breast cancer, patients whose pathology and
      imaging are discordant, and those with extensive calcifications extending over 2cm, a mass
      larger than 2 cm, or lesions with high-risk features. Informed consent will be obtained and
      patients will be randomized to standard surgical excision or VAPE. They will then be followed
      with imaging as appropriate.

      The primary outcome measure is the incidence of complete removal of the lesion. The secondary
      outcome measures are patient satisfaction, cosmetic outcomes and complications such as
      bleeding and infection.

      This trial is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the role of VAPE compared
      to standard surgical excision as a means of completely excising borderline or high-risk
      breast, non-malignant breast lesions. The investigators hypothesize that VAPE will show
      comparable efficacy and may even have improved safety, cosmesis and patient satisfaction.

    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction as assessed by the BREAST-Q questionnaire for breast conserving therapy, Version 2.0, a validated patient-reported outcome measure that quantifies health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction. It will be completed preoperatively, and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.
There are three components being assessed:
Physical well-being: 10 items scored using a 3-point scale (1=none of the time, 2=some of the time, 3=all of the time).
Psychosocial well-being: 10 items scored using a 5-point scale (1=none of the time, 2=a little of the time, 3=some of the time, 4=most of the time, 5=all of the time).
Satisfaction with breasts: 4 items scored using a 4-point scale (1=very dissatisfied, 2=somewhat dissatisfied, 3=somewhat satisfied, 4=very satisfied).
Each component has a raw scale summed score (the sum of all the scores for each item) that is converted into a score from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Cosmesis</measure>

    <description>Cosmesis as assessed by the Modified Harvard-Harris Cosmetic Scale, a validated four-point scale that describes the overall aesthetic appearance of the breasts (categorical scale = excellent, good, fair or poor). It will be administered to both the patients as a self-assessment and the surgeons before the intervention and at various time points postoperatively (1 month, 6 months, and 12 months).</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo vacuum-assisted percutaneous excision (VAPE). The intervention group will have post-procedure imaging the same day to confirm complete excision.
The intervention group will then have imaging at 6, 12, and 24 months as per the radiology algorithms for following suspicious lesions (BIRADS 3 category). If at any point during the imaging follow up, a suspicious lesion or calcifications are detected, it would be sampled with core needle biopsy and then surgically excised as appropriate.
The intervention group will also be seen in clinic at 1 month with no imaging and then at 6, 12, and 24 months to correspond to the imaging visits.</description>

The control group will then have follow up imaging at 12 and 24 months as per the usual radiology algorithms following excision of a lesion. If at any point during the imaging follow up, a suspicious lesion or calcifications are detected, it would be sampled with core needle biopsy and then surgically excised as appropriate.
The control group will also be seen in clinic at 1 month with no imaging and then at 12 and 24 months to correspond to the imaging visits.</description>
