  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our clinical study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of osteoporosis (OP) in patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to investigate the relationship between clinical, disease
      activity, physical function and disease duration, and bone mineral density (BMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this cross-sectional study, patients who were admitted to the rheumatology clinic between
      18 and 65 years of age and diagnosed as AS according to the modified New York diagnostic
      criteria were included

      Patients group was divided two part as patients with (group 1)and without (group 2)
      osteoporosis.

      The patient's global rating scale is a self-assessed scale of the patient with a grade of 10
      (1: very bad, 5: moderate, 10: very good). To assess the disease activity, Bath ankylosing
      spondylitis disease index (BASDAI) and Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (BASFI)
      were evaluated. BASDAI is a self-assessment scale used to determine disease activity in
      patients with AS.

      Schober measurement was used to evaluate lumbar mobility of the patients. Chest expansions
      were measured in all patients.

      Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as kg/height m2. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESH mm
      / h), C-reactive protein (CRP mg / l) levels were measured in all patients.

      BMD measurements were made by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and lumbar
      vertebra (L1-4) and left femur (femoral neck and total) regions. DEXA measurements (GE /
      LUNAR DPX PRO) were performed and the results were recorded using standard T score. Bone
      mineral densities of patients were based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
      classification of a T score between -1 and -2.5 for osteopenia; and a score of -2.5 for
      osteoporosis.

    <measure>Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI, is a widely used patient-reported outcome to measure disease activity in AS. It comprises only six questions (Box 5.1).
The answers to these questions are scored on a 0-10 NRS, which are anchored by 0 (&quot;none&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very severe&quot;). The BASDAI sum score is calculated by the sum of questions 1-4 plus mean of questions 5 and 6, the total then divided by 5. The sum score ranges from 0 to 10, higher values indicate more active disease.</description>

    <measure>Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (BASFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI): this is the most frequently used tool to asses function in AS. It contains 10 questions on activities of daily living, which are scored with a rating scale from 0 (no functional impairments) to 10 (maximal impairment). The sum score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating worse functioning.</description>

    <description>Osteoporosis has been operationally defined on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD) assessment. According to the WHO criteria, osteoporosis is defined as a BMD that lies 2.5 standard deviations or more below the average value for young healthy women (a T-score of &lt;-2.5 SD)</description>
