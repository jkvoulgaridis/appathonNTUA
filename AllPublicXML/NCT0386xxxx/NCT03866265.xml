    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a normal immune response to tissue healing. However, uncontrolled and
      unresolved inflammation can initiate and further induce several chronic manifestations that
      contribute to chronic disorders such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). A
      'cross-talk' between platelets, endothelial cells and leukocytes, accompanied by activation
      and aggregation of platelets, contribute to inflammation-related atherogenic, atherosclerotic
      and athero-thrombotic events.

      Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) and Thrombin are the most potent platelet agonists inducing
      platelet activation and aggregation that are also implicated in the patho-physiology of
      platelets and endothelium and thus in inflammation-related chronic disorders. Therefore, the
      inhibition of PAF and Thrombin related pathways of platelet aggregation, coagulation and
      inflammation provide a potential therapeutic strategy for anti-platelet, anti-coagulation and
      suppression of inflammatory responses in CVDs and other chronic disorders.

      The investigators have previously reported bio-active lipid molecules with strong anti-PAF
      and anti-Thrombin effects to be present in natural, non-toxic food, microorganisms, plants
      and especially in several marine sources. The plethora of in vitro beneficial bio-activities
      of marine polar lipids (PLs) against atherosclerosis and CVDs indicate therapeutic potential.
      Recently, the investigators have also demonstrated that PLs extracted from Irish, organic
      farmed salmon (Salmo salar) display strong in vitro anti-thrombotic effects against platelet
      aggregation, bio-activities that were related to inhibitory effect against PAF and Thrombin
      pathways.

      The present study investigates the putative anti-platelet effects in healthy human subjects
      following ingestion of a novel supplement containing food-grade extracts of bio-active salmon
      polar lipids (FGE-Salmon-PLs).

      The study has a double blind randomized cross-over placebo-controlled design in healthy
      subjects.

      Each Subject will be administrated the FGE-Salmon-PLs Food Supplement capsules for 28 days (a
      capsule containing 0.125 g of FGE-Salmon-PLs per day) and platelet sensitivity against both
      PAF and Thrombin will be tested in blood samples of each subject just before and after the
      supplement administration. The same tests will be conducted in blood samples of each
      participant in a crossover design before and after 28 days of placebo capsules administration
      (a capsule containing 0.125 g of glycerin per day).

    <textblock>
      The present study investigates the putative anti-platelet effects in healthy human subjects
      (N=20) following ingestion of a novel supplement containing food-grade extracts of bio-active
      salmon polar lipids (FGE-Salmon-PLs).

      The study has a double blind randomized cross-over placebo-controlled design in healthy
      subjects.

      After appropriate screening, 20 of the recruited subjects will provide baseline blood samples
      and then 10 of them will be initially administered a food supplement capsule (containing
      0.125 g of FGE-Salmon-PLs) per day for a period of 28 days, while another 10 of them will
      initially be administered a placebo capsule (containing 0.125 g of glycerin) per day, in a
      double blind and randomized way.

      After the period of 28 days, each participant will provide blood samples at the 29th day.

      Then a washout period of 14 days will follow, in which each participant will not be
      administered any kind of supplements or placebo capsules.

      After this washout period of 14 days, each participant will provide again new baseline blood
      samples and then in a crossover design the participants that were initially administered the
      food supplement will now be administered the placebo capsules for 28 days (a placebo capsule
      per day), while likewise the participants that were initially administered the supplement
      capsules will now be administered the food supplement capsules for 28 days.

      After this new period of 28 days, each participant will provide again blood samples at the
      new 29th day.

      Plasma reach in platelets of all blood samples from each participant, before and after each
      kind of administration (of either placebo or supplement capsules), will be tested for their
      platelet sensitivity against both PAF and Thrombin induced platelet aggregation.

After 28-days, blood samples will be collected from all Subjects. No administration of any kind of capsules will follow for 14 days for all Subjects.
After this 14-days period, blood samples will be collected from all Subjects Then, in a crossover design each participant initially on supplement will now be administered the placebo capsules, while likewise each participant initially on placebo will now be administered the supplement capsules for 28 days.
After this new 28-days period, blood samples will be collected from all Subjects.
All collected blood samples from each participant will be tested for their platelet sensitivity against both PAF and Thrombin induced platelet aggregation.</intervention_model_description>
