  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase in life expectancy of the world population is associated with a higher incidence
      of diseases, leading to functional incapacity and dependence in old age. Aging is usually
      accompanied by progressive loss of muscle mass, muscular strength and functional capacity,
      possibly exacerbated by inactivity and low protein and energy consumption of elderly
      individuals. However, the response to strength training, as well as the daily recommendation
      of protein and other factors related to sarcopenia in this population seem not to be well
      understood. Objective: To evaluate the effect of protein intake and resistance training on
      body composition, muscle strength and functional capacity in the elderly. METHODS: A
      randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted with 38 elderly people, ≥ 60
      years old, sedentary, and body mass index between 22 and 30 kg / m2. All those who agree to
      participate will be randomized into two groups (intervention or placebo) and will undergo an
      initial assessment consisting of food consumption analysis through the application of the
      three-day food record, assessment of muscle thickness of the thigh and arm by muscle
      ultrasonography, evaluation of body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA),
      dynamic maximal strength (1RM) test of knee extension and elbow flexion, peak torque test of
      knee extension, functional capacity tests and quality of life questionnaire (SF-36). The
      elderly will participate in resistance training for 12 weeks, two session per week. The
      intervention group will be supplemented with whey protein isolate (2x / day - 20g for
      breakfast and 20g for dinner) and the placebo group will receive maltodextrin (2x / day - 20g
      for breakfast and 20g for dinner). All outcomes will be assessed before and after the 12-week
      resistance training period.
