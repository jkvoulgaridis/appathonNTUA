  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) represent the leading cause of death in France. Their
      incidence is increasing due to population aging and to the persistence of cardiovascular risk
      factors. Currently, revascularization surgery remains outside the emergency treatment,
      because early performed, it tends to lead to extension and hemorrhage of the infarcted area,
      because of the CPB, aortic clamping, cardioplegia, and other heart manipulation.

      However, CABG are indicated as an emergency in some situations of STEMI: Threat of infarction
      of an extended territory without favorable anatomy to angioplasty, anatomy not favorable to
      angioplasty associated with cardiogenic shock or persistent ischemia, acute complications of
      myocardial infarction (massive mitral insufficiency, interventricular communication, parietal
      rupture) requiring surgery under CPB with concomitant bypass surgery or failure of
      angioplasty (proximal coronary dissection).

      Operative mortality is high; 15 to 20% for patients operated 12 to 48 hours after AMI and
      4-5% for those operated after 48 hours.

      Nevertheless, it seems legitimate to study if there would be a place for primary surgical
      revascularization in case of patient with hemodynamically stable ACS, in order to limit
      myocardial ischemia, spread of necrosis, to limit the risk of recurrence, and the
      consequences of low cardiac output. Performing a complete early surgical revascularization
      could limit the ischemia-reperfusion syndrome and anticipate the occurrence of cardiogenic
      shock.

    <ipd_description>Screening of patients will be done from lists of patients who have undergone emergency coronary bypass surgery Demographic, clinical, paraclinical and biological data of patients will be collected internally using the data available in the computerized patient record of Dijon University Hospital (DxCare).
The data will be collected in an Excel file, which is hosted by the CHU server. As this is a monocentric observational study, it is not envisaged that the data will be transferred outside Dijon University Hospital.</ipd_description>
