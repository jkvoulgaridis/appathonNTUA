  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is testing the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of NVX-108
      administered via intravenous infusion in combination with standard radiation and
      chemotherapy.

      NVX-108 is being developed to increase the amount of oxygen delivered to tumors which is
      hoped to increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically-confirmed newly-diagnosed primary and secondary glioblastoma
             multiforme.

          2. No prior treatment for glioblastoma apart from surgical resection.

          3. Planned for 60 Gy of focal radiation administered in 30 fractions, concurrently with
             temozolomide chemotherapy.

          4. Manageable risks associated with potential radiation necrosis in the radiation field,
             based on size of the field and proximity to eloquent brain regions (as assessed by the
             investigator).

          5. Aged 18 years and older.

          6. Karnofsky Performance Status Scale ≥ 60.

          7. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          8. If receiving glucocorticoid therapy, the dose must be stable or decreasing over at
             least 7 days prior to study enrolment.

          9. Archived tumor tissue (10 slides per patient) available for central review.

         10. Able to undergo gadolinium-enhanced MRI (Gd-MRI) scans.

         11. Baseline MRI performed within 28 days before starting study treatment (see Section
             7.2.6), while on a stable glucocorticoid dose for at least 7 days before and during
             the imaging study.

         12. Adequate hematologic, renal and hepatic function, as defined by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dl

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin within normal limits (≤ 2.5 x ULN if Gilbert's syndrome)

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 3 x ULN

             vasectomized) must agree to use a highly-effective method of birth control from study
             entry until 4 months after completing study therapy. Should a study participant or
             their partner become pregnant or suspect a pregnancy they should inform the treating
             physician immediately.

         14. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          9. Known History of Congenital long QT syndrome (12-lead EKG is not required).

         10. Clinically-significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.
