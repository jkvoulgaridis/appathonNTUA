  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of solriamfetol in improving sleep in patients
      with grade II-IV glioma. Solriamfetol is a wakefulness-promoting drug. Giving solriamfetol
      may improve sleep, memory, fatigue, mood, or quality of life in patients with brain tumors
      (gliomas).

      Primary Objective:

      I. To estimate the safety of solriamfetol at 75 mg daily, 150 mg daily, 300 mg daily as
      assessed by NCI CTC Adverse Events (v5.0) in patients with primary gliomas compared to prior
      studies.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      I. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on sleep by Epworth Sleepiness Scores (ESS) scores
      in patients with primary gliomas and compare the effect to previously published scores in
      patients with OSA

      II. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      scores

      III. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on neurocognitive function based on a
      disease-specific neurocognitive battery (see neurocognitive battery below)

      IV. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on patient-reported fatigue (Brief Fatigue
      Inventory, Cancer Fatigue Scale) &amp; mood (Beck's Depression Inventory)

      V. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on patient-reported QOL (FACT-Br)

      VI. To estimate the effect of solriamfetol on objective sleep-wake times by actigraphy and
      sleep diary (pre- vs post-treatment)

      Exploratory Objective(s)

      I. To explore a biologic gradient effect of increasing doses of solriamfetol on actigraphy

      II. To explore differences in clinical activity of solriamfetol by corticosteroid use,
      antiepileptic use, and tumor grade.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive solriamfetol orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
