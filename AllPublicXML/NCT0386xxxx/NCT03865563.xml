      Overall, subjects with resectable, borderline-resectable and/or locally-advanced pancreatic
      cancer are eligible to be entered into the study. Each enrolled study subject will receive a
      single neoadjuvant pancreatic retrograde venous infusion (PRVI) administration of the
      gemcitabine/Lipiodol® emulsion.

      Complete enrollment in 12 months from date of enrollment of first study subject.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, single institution, single-arm pilot study, designed to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of retrograde venous infusion of gemcitabine/Lipiodol® administered in a neoadjuvant setting for the treatment of patients with resectable, borderline-resectable or locally-advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Access will be gained into the portal vein via a transhepatic approach. The pancreatic tumor-draining veins will be accessed via a catheter positioned in the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein or splenic vein. The catheter is then advanced into the vein draining the segment in which the targeted tumor is located. Tumor location and its venous drainage will be confirmed with sub-selective pancreatic venography and cone-beam CT. Once correct catheter positioning is confirmed, the gemcitabine/Lipiodol® emulsion will be administered under real-time fluoroscopic guidance until the entire dose is administered or until stasis is achieved in the vein through which the drug is being delivered.</description>
