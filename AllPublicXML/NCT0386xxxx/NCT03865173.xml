    <textblock>
      The link between post-stroke pathways and patient sequelae have not yet been clearly defined.
      The main purpose is to identify the post-stroke life pathways components associated with
      sequalae at 3 months and 1 year after the acute stroke episode.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is a serious health event, involving the entire health care system and generating
      considerable socioeconomic weight for society. Knowledge of the components, the diversity and
      the scalability of post-stroke life pathways is currently not sufficient. Moreover the link
      between post-stroke pathways and patient sequelae have not yet been clearly defined.

      The main purpose is to identify the post-stroke life pathways components associated with
      sequalae at 3 months and 1 year after the acute stroke episode. The secondary objectives are:
      1) To define a typology of the life pathways of stroke patients, , 2) To analyze the social
      and geographical inequalities in the management of stroke, 4) To estimate the cost of the
      pathway elements of stroke management; 5) Measure the sequelae of stroke patients at three
      months and one year after the acute episode.

      The design is a prospective multicenter cohort study with a follow up to 1 year after the
      acute episode, managed in several hospitals in the Aquitaine region (France).

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression, since both share some of the same symptoms. Essentially, the FSS consists of answering a short questionaire that requires the subject to rate his or her own level of fatigue. The subject is asked to read each statem ent and circle a number from 1 to 7, depending on how appropriate they felt the statement applied to them over the preceding week. A low value indicates that the statement is not very appropriate whereas a high value indicates agreement. The scoring is done by calculating the average response to the questions (adding up all the answers and dividing by nine).
People with depression alone score about 4.5. People with fatigue average about 6.5.</description>

Items are rated in terms of whether individuals can perform activities independently, with some assistance, or are dependent (scored as 10, 5 or 0). Items are weighted according to the level of nursing care required.
