  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home blood pressure measurement has been reported to be associated with better clinic blood
      pressure and daytime blood pressure control. However, no study has evaluated the association
      between home blood pressure measurement and control of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in
      real world practice.

      The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of home blood pressure
      measurement on the control of ambulatory blood pressure in the real world.

      The detailed purposes of the present study are (1) to investigate the effects of home blood
      pressure measurement on the appropriate control of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in
      hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive drug, (2) to evaluate the effect of home
      blood pressure measurement on the occurrence of cardiovascular events and target organ
      damage, (3) to investigate the status and appropriateness of home blood pressure measurement
      in the real world, and (4) to investigate factors of home blood pressure measurement methods
      affecting the treatment of hypertension.
