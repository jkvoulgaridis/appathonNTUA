      The second visit of the Expanded Programme of Immunization when the child is 2 months old
      (EPI-2) represents a unique opportunity to link the EPI and PMTCT programmes and to introduce
      preventive and therapeutic rescue interventions in order to 1) Assess the efficacy of the
      PMTCT cascade up to 2 months postpartum; 2) Allow at least 80% of HIV-1-infected infants
      identified at the second EPI visit who were not involved in HIV care to initiate ARVs at the
      earliest, but no later than 2 months after confirmation of HIV diagnosis; 3) Reduce HIV-1
      transmission to less than 3% between 2 and 12 months among exposed children who completed the
      second EPI visit

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO recommendation of lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected pregnant
      or breastfeeding women represents a major advance for universal access to HIV care but this
      strategy alone may not be sufficient to eliminate pediatric HIV in the communities.

      Presently, the impact of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs in
      the communities is unclear. There is also no available rescue intervention able to identify
      postpartum women at high risk of transmission in order to offer them adequate HIV care and
      prevent HIV acquisition by their breastfed infants.

      We hypothesize that the second visit for routine vaccination (Expanded Program of
      Immunization visit 2, EPI-2) represents a unique opportunity to link EPI and PMTCT programs
      and introduce rescue preventive and therapeutic interventions.

      The study will assess the efficacy of the PMTCT cascade up to 2 months post-partum for all
      mothers attending the EPI-2 (Component 1). For Component 1, the target population will be all
      30,000 women participating in EPI-2 and verbally consenting to participate. A cross-sectoral
      evaluation of the PMTCT programme up to 2 months postpartum (Component 1).

      For Component 2 - phase IIb trial (N = 150 mother-infant pairs) - the target population will
      be breastfeeding mothers aged 15 years or older with uncontrolled HIV-1 infection (≥1000
      copies/ml) with a child whose tests so far do not reveal the existence of infection (EPI-2
      visit) and who meet the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria to assess the effectiveness of a
      rescue intervention for Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV up to 12 months of
      age to prevent infection. Specifically, for HIV+ women who give consent, the measurement of
      their HIV-1 viral load and the detection of HIV-1 DNA in their children will be assessed.
      Children infected with HIV-1 will be referred for immediate ART initiation. The target
      population will be women with uncontrolled HIV-1 infection (≥1000 copies of HIV-1 RNA/ml)
      with a child whose tests to date (EPI-2 visit) do not reveal the existence of infection and
      who meet the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria to assess the effectiveness of a rescue
      intervention for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV. To do this, eligible
      children will receive a PrEP (lamivudine) up to 12 months of age or the confirmed end of
      breastfeeding to prevent infection.

      Women infected with HIV-1 with HIV-1 infection tested at the time of the EPI-2 visit (&lt;1000
      copies of HIV-1 RNA/ml) will be followed at 6 and 12 months. If at 6 months the mother has an
      uncontrolled HIV infection, her child could receive ARV medication up to 12 months of age or
      the confirmed end of breastfeeding to prevent infection.

      The control group does not apply to this study. The overall mother-to-child transmission rate
      is the WHO target for the elimination of paediatric HIV-1: 5% at one year of life (consistent
      with a 3% postnatal transmission rate between 2 and 12 months of age of the child).
