      The effect of a modular seating system on coronal and sagittal balance of the spine and
      pelvic obliquity in children with non ambulatory (Gross Motor Function Classification System
      Level IV-V) and scoliosis

      The hypothesis in our study is; a modular adaptive seating system prevents the progression of
      spinal curvature and Reimer's maturation index, improves the sagittal balance of the spine
      and pelvic obliquity.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a modular adaptive seating system
      and exercise therapy for scoliosis on the progression of spinal curvature, spinal sagittal
      balance and pelvic obliquity in children aged 6 to 15 years with cerebral palsy (Gross Motor
      Function Classification System (GMFCS) level IV-V) and scoliosis.

      Materials and methods: A prospective, randomized and controlled, single-blind study was
      performed on 29 patients with cerebral palsy(CP). Patients were randomized into two groups.
      Both groups were given scoliosis home exercise program at least three days a week and 10
      repetitions for each exercise in a day. In the first group, a modular adaptive seating system
      used for at least four hours in a day with exercise program for scoliosis. This seating
      system includes a sitting elevation that corrects the pelvic obliquity, the hip block that
      prevents the sliding from the sitting floor and a body support unit that provides the
      alignment of the spine and controls of the body. Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity, sagittal
      spino-pelvic parameters (thoracic kyphosis angle (TK), lumbar lordosis angle (LL), sagittal
      vertical axis (SVA), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slop (SS)) and Reimer's
      migration index (RMI) measurements were evaluated by Surgimap® software at the before and 3
      months after treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>There are two groups in this study. In the first group, there is home exercises program for scoliosis and a modular adaptive seating system. In the second group there is only home exercises program for scoliosis. The nonambulatory children between the ages of 6-15 with cerebral palsy and scoliosis were randomly grouped according to the order of Pediatric Rehabilitation Unit of Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department.</intervention_model_description>
