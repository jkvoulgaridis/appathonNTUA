  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, investigators will administer calcium chloride or placebo to pregnant
      women undergoing Cesarean delivery who have been identified as high risk for hemorrhage due
      to poor uterine muscle contraction, or atony. They will assess whether a single dose of
      calcium given immediately after the delivery of the fetus decreases the incidence of uterine
      atony and bleeding for the mother. The pharmacokinetics of calcium chloride in pregnant women
      will also be established. Data from this pilot study of 40 patients will be used to determine
      sample size and appropriateness of a larger randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor contraction of the uterus, also known as uterine atony, is the leading cause of severe
      blood loss during Cesarean section, both in the US and worldwide. Exogenous calcium has been
      shown to increase uterine muscle contraction in in vitro and in animal studies. Calcium is
      also an essential factor in normal blood clotting. Anesthesiologists commonly administer
      intravenous calcium chloride during Cesarean as well as other types of surgery, but formal
      randomized studies to determine efficacy in improving uterine tone have not been performed.

      In this pilot, randomized controlled study, the anesthesiologist will administer a one-time
      dose of intravenous calcium chloride 1gram versus placebo at the time of fetal delivery to
      women identified as having high risk of hemorrhage during Cesarean delivery. Primary outcome
      assessed will be a composite measure of uterine atony. Data from the pilot study will be used
      to perform power and sample size calculations for a larger study. Secondary outcomes assessed
      will include total blood loss, subjective assessment of uterine tone by the blinded
      obstetrician performing surgery, safety, side effects, and pharmacokinetic profile of calcium
      chloride in pregnant women.

    <masking_description>Randomization has been performed and study ID designation to drug or placebo arm allocated to opaque envelopes prior to subject enrollment. An anesthesiologist not involved in clinical care of the patient or data entry or analysis opens the envelope at the time of subject enrollment and prepares the study drug versus placebo in a 60mL syringe, labeled only with subject ID#. Drug and placebo appear identical as clear solutions and are administered by the same protocol.

Administration of &gt; 1 bolus of oxytocin
Increase in the oxytocin infusion rate above the standard 7.5units/hour
Administration of a second line uterotonic including methylergonovine, carboprost, or misoprostol
Mechanical surgical interventions for uterine atony including placement of an intrauterine balloon, B-lynch sutures, or O'Leary sutures

    <description>Change in ionized calcium concentration over time. Blood calcium concentration will be measured at the following time points: baseline (pre-drug delivery), 0-20 minutes after drug administration, and 20-90 minutes after delivery. The resulting values for concentration over time will be evaluated with NONMEM (Non Linear Mixed Effects Modeling) to determine whether a 1, 2 or 3 compartment model is optimal to describe the data. Results will be expressed as the appropriate coefficients and exponents depending on the optimal model. Participants undergo up to 3 phlebotomy specimens to allow measurement of the serum ionized calcium. Samples are drawn at baseline, at random time points after study drug administration while in the operating room, and upon arrival to the recovery room</description>
