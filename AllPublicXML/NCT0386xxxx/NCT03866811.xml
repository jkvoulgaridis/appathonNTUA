  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of an
      emergency department-based pregnancy prevention intervention targeting sexually active
      adolescent female emergency department patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency Departments (ED) care for 15 million adolescents each year. Adolescents who use the
      ED are at particularly high risk of unintended pregnancy. To date, no intervention has
      successfully increased contraception use among this high risk, hard-to-reach ED population.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a
      user-informed, theory-based, personalized, interactive, pregnancy prevention text messaging
      intervention (Dr. Erica) to determine its feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy.
      The investigators hypothesize that high risk adolescent female ED patients who receive Dr.
      Erica will more often initiate contraceptives than those females who receive standard
      discharge instructions alone.

      At baseline and follow-up assessment at 3 months, participants will provide information
      regarding effective contraception initiation, any contraception at last intercourse, follow
      up with reproductive preventive health services, and contraception self-efficacy.

birth control patch
birth control pills or oral contraceptives

    <description>The 10 week texting intervention contains the follow characteristics to increase engagement: (1) Dr. ERICA (Emergency Room Interventions to Improve the Care of Adolescents): The persona and brand of the intervention is Dr. Erica, a relatable, empathetic, straightforward and reliable female doctor; (2) Personalization: Information collected at baseline will be incorporated into each individualized program; (3) Interactivity: The majority of text message algorithms contain 3-4 two-way automated messaging conversations. (4) Feedback loops: The investigators will collect feedback from participants to prompt action; (5) Visual stimuli: Texts include emojis, memes, and other visual stimuli, similar to current teen texting behaviors; (6) Social media: The investigators designed sexual health comic strips posted as an Instagram story; (7) Links and role modeling: Texts contain links to testimonials, influencers, and evidence-based websites.</description>
