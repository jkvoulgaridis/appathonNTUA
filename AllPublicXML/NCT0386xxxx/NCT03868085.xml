  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the severity and time course (natural history) of disuse osteopenia that occurs in
      the lower extremity(ies) and lumbar spine of patients sustaining lower extremity injuries
      that require the patient to maintain restricted weight bearing status (12 weeks) following
      the surgical fixation of the patient's injuries.

      The investigators hypothesize that there will be a significant decrease in the bone mineral
      density in the lower limbs of patients undergoing restricted weight bearing for
      peri-articular injuries of the lower extremity. This loss of bone mineral density is often
      prolonged in its duration and may lower subsequent fracture threshold and prolong the time to
      recovery and return to activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that restricted weight bearing even for relatively short periods (12
      weeks) associated with the surgical treatment of peri-articular injuries of the lower
      extremity (ie acetabulum, distal femur, tibial plateau, pilon, talus, calcaneus) can lead to
      a measurable decrease in bone density in the injured limb. Furthermore, this osteopenia can
      persist for extended periods of time - much longer than the original period of restricted
      weight bearing. This relative osteopenia can delay recovery from injury, lower fracture
      threshold for subsequent injury and potentially delay return to active duty in the case of a
      wounded warrior. There exists a significant body of research in the modulation of the
      osteopenia associated with restricted weight bearing as it pertains to long term space flight
      (microgravity).
