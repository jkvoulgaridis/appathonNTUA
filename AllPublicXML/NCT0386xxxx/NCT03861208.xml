  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective random controlled cross-over intervention studies is designed to ascertain
      if children feel different levels of hunger and fullness before and after eating test meals
      consisting of high-satiety vs. usual foods and if the child's perceived hunger/fullness is
      related to their salivary ghrelin levels and a variety of learning outcomes. Data are
      collected at the Diet and Nutrition (DAN) laboratory on repeated study days (8am - 4 pm).

      The investigator's previous research has shown that preschoolers recognized changes in the
      feelings of hunger/fullness before and after a single test meal. If preschooler's feelings of
      hunger are associated with their ghrelin (hunger hormone) levels is not known. This study is
      designed to assess children's changes in feelings of hunger throughout the day (8 pm to 4 pm)
      and to measure both subjective feelings of hunger and salivary ghrelin levels before and
      after a standardized test meal (lunch).

      An important secondary outcome related to children's feelings of hunger is their ability to
      learn. Currently, there is lack of data on the direct link between perceived hunger/fullness
      and learning processes. This study addresses these gaps using preschooler's perceived
      feelings of hunger and fullness (using a published 4-point scale (Kranz S.et al.
      &quot;High-Protein and High-Dietary-Fiber Breakfasts Result in Equal Feelings of Fullness and
      Better Diet Quality in Low-Income Preschoolers Compared with Their Usual Breakfast&quot; J Nutr
      doi: 10.3945/jn.116.234153, 2017) and a battery of learning tests (HTKS, KRISP, Stroop-style
      tasks, Woodcock Johnson vocabulary test, DCCS, and curisoty measures.)

    <description>hunger/fullness scale. change in children's perceived hunger and fullness on an age-appropriate scale: children respond to the question of &quot;are you hungry or full&quot; (coded hungry (1 or 2) or full (3 or 4)) followed by &quot;are you very hungry( or full) or just a little hungry (or full)&quot; coded as 1=very hungry, 2=a little hungry, 3- a little full, 4=very full, thus leading to a 4-point likert scale (from 1 to 4 with 1 being &quot;very hungry&quot; and 4 being &quot;very full&quot;). The development of the scale and its use are published by Kranz S. et al, Journal of Nutrition, 2017.</description>
