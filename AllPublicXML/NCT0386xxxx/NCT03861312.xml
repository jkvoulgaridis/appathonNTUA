  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain is one of the most common causes of pain, affecting 15% of the adult
      population, and the fourth leading cause of disability. The recognition of laterality is the
      ability to recognize a part of the body that belongs to the left or right which is used as a
      tool to create a normal process of motor planning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most consistent data come from the investigation of the primary motor cortex, in which
      the cortical representations of the altered body part are affected when there is chronic
      pain. Occasionally, the primary motor cortex is smaller on the affected side than on the
      contralateral side.

      Recognition of the body schema is altered in the presence of painful disorders. The most
      common way of assessing the body schema is by motor imagery through the laterality
      discrimination of the left and right.
