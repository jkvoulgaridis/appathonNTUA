      Compare periodized (cyclic) resistance training with and without motor training specific to
      activities of daily living.

    <textblock>
      This study will look at how well two different daily undulating training programs
      (hypertrophy-strength-power training, versus strength-power-functional training) improve
      participants' physical functions. All testing procedures will take place at the Max Orovitz
      Laboratory on the Coral Gables campus. This study will involve a 1-week baseline testing
      phase, a 2-week familiarization phase, a 9-week intervention phase, and a 1-week post-testing
      window where subjects must report to the lab for 2 sessions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be asked to stand up from a standard chair with a seat height of between 40 and 50 centimeters, walk a 3-meter distance at a normal pace, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The test takes approximately 2-4 minutes to complete with instructions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will perform the concentric phase within the limits of the participant's own specific range of motion for each joint/movement tested over 2 second periods. The tester will gradually increase the resistance for each repetition until the participant are not able to move the lever arm one time through the full range of motion. The participant will be asked how hard the test felt after each repetition and each muscle group will be finished in a maximum of seven repetitions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The gait test will be a standard 10 meter gait test at usual (two trials) and maximum (2 trials) speed. The participant will be timed using a stopwatch.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Seated Medicine Ball Chest Throw</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be seated in an armless chair with their backs against the seat back and feet flat on the floor. They will then asked to throw a 3kg medicine ball as far as they can. Subjects are allowed to practice as many times as they want. Two trails will be performed with and a one minute rest will be provided.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>30 Second Sit-to-Stand Power Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will be asked to sit in a chair with their feet flat on the ground and their arms placed across their chest. They will stand fully as many times times as they can in 30 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Best test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 14-item test designed to measure the participant's balance while standing still and moving. The test takes about 15-20 minutes and includes the following activities:
Sit to stand
Rise to toes
Stand on one leg
Compensatory stepping correction - forward
Compensatory stepping correction - backward
Compensatory stepping correction - lateral
Stance (feet together); eyes open, firm surface
Stance (feet together); eyes closed, foam surface
Incline eyes closed
Change in speed
Walk with head turns - horizontal
Walk with pivot turns
Step over obstacles
Timed up and go (TUG) with and without dual task</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Strength training will use 75-80% of the subject's maximum for the specific exercise and contractions will occur at 2s concentric and 3s eccentric for the strength day. 30-80% of subjects' maximal strength for the power day with high-speed concentric and 2 second eccentric contractions, and exercises that simulate activities of daily living for the motor practice day. All resistance-training will be performed on Keiser air-driven machines. Subjects will perform 10 exercises targeting all major muscle groups. The training will last for 12 consecutive weeks, for a total of 36 visits. Each visit will be approximately 60 minutes long and will consist of 5 minutes warm-up, 50 minutes of training and five minutes of cool-down.</description>
