  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlude devices are used for over ten years. According to current
      data efficiency and safety of this approach at least comparable with pharmacological
      prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

      However, to date, LAA occluder implantation is not recommended as an alternative for
      conservative therapy and reserved for patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulants
      only. In the same time, long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in clinical trials and data
      from registries showed that LAA occlude device implantation as an alternative to oral
      anticoagulation could reduce drug load, decrease complexity and cost of treatment and thus
      improve patients' quality of life, and potentially may reduce the risk of death. The aim of
      our study is to investigate the risk of all-cause death, stroke, and bleedings in patients
      with LAA occluder implanted as an alternative to anticoagulant therapy.

      Three hundred patients with atrial fibrillation will undergo LAA occluder implantation. For
      LAA occluder sizing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), CT and LAA angiography will be
      performed. The follow-up period will be 36 months. The incidence of all-cause death, stroke,
      bleeding BARC≥2, device-related complications and QOL will be investigated.

      The patients will be followed in the clinic at three and six months, and then at 12, 24 and
      36 months, the telephone calls for getting information about endpoints events will be done.
      Additional in clinic visits will be scheduled if the late complications will be suspected.

      TEE will be performed at three and six months to check for device leak, displacement and
      thrombosis.
