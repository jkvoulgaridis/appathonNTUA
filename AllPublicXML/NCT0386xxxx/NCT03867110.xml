  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced-parallel-group,
      efficacy and safety trial of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin in adult participants
      with primary hypercholesterolemia. The primary hypothesis is that the coadministration of
      ezetimibe 10 mg/day with atorvastatin (pooled across all doses: 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg)
      will result in a significantly greater reduction in direct low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) when compared with atorvastatin (pooled across all doses: 10
      mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg) alone and ezetimibe 10 mg alone.

             stable dose for at least 8 weeks before the initial qualifying LDL-C level is drawn.
             Aspirin up to 325 mg/day is permitted. In addition, aspirin is allowed as a as needed
             (prn) concomitant medication.
