  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IMPRoVE study is a prospective, non-interventional, explorative cohort study to determine
      prognostic immune markers in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer,
      and primary peritoneal cancer (EOC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor material, ascites (if possible) and blood samples for immune monitoring will be
      collected from patients with primary and recurrent EOC undergoing surgery, chemotherapy
      and/or immunotherapy.
