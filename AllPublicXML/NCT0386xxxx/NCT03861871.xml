      This study will be enrolling 10 patients, ages 2-18 years old, with a confirmed
      genetic/clinical diagnosis of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) in an open label trial of
      fenfluramine for seizure control. Patients will be titrated over 14 days to a dose of ZX008
      0.8 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 30 mg/d).

    <description>The items of the four-part scale (Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning ,items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL (Health-Related Quality of Life). The mean is computed as the sum of the items over the number of items answered in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Scales. The Physical Health Summary Score is the same as the Physical Functioning Scale Score.</description>

             monoamine-oxidase inhibitors; any centrally-acting compound with clinically
             appreciable amount of serotonin agonist or antagonist properties, including serotonin
             reuptake inhibition; atomoxetine, or other centrally-acting noradrenergic agonist; or
             cyproheptadine. (see appendix 1)
