  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored
      message intervention delivered via virtual human technology for increasing colorectal cancer
      (CRC) screening within guidelines. Although participation is not limited to these groups, the
      study team is particularly interested in the feasibility of the intervention for reaching
      racial/ethnic minority and rural patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) morbidity and mortality by
      increasing CRC screening rates among the at-risk patient community and to reduce racial and
      geographic (rural vs. urban) disparities in CRC screening and mortality rates. To accomplish
      this long-term goal, this study aims to develop and test precision messaging tailored to
      target audiences through development and evaluation of culturally sensitive, interactive
      messages about CRC screening delivered using VHT. The study will investigate whether
      interactive, tailored messages contribute to an overall enhancement of knowledge of CRC and
      screening options by eliciting positive attitudes and behaviors toward FIT screening.

      To date, there is no other study that has looked to partner specific message strategies and
      colorectal cancer screening with an emphasis on racial concordance and modality. As such, the
      researchers hope to shed new light on how, as health communicators, to more successfully
      engage target audiences to change attitudes and/or behaviors towards getting screened for
      colorectal cancer.

I feel my doctor does not do everything he/she should about my medical care. I trust my doctor to put my medical needs above all other considerations when treating my medical problems.
My doctor is well qualified to manage (diagnose and treat or make an appropriate referral) medical problems like mine.
I trust my doctor to tell me if a mistake was made about my treatment. I sometimes worry that my doctor may not keep the information we discuss totally private.</description>
