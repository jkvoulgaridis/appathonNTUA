  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of candidate dengue vaccine formulations, it is prudent to
      develop an appropriate challenge model. This study supports the expansion of the data set of
      the current Dengue 1 Live Virus Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) model to produce uncomplicated
      dengue-like illness.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an expansion of a previous study conducted under NCT02372175. In this study up to
      nine healthy subjects between 18 and 45 years old will be inoculated with Dengue 1 Live Virus
      Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) at a dose used in the previous study. Subjects will be closely
      monitored for the first 28 days with continued follow up through 6 months. Clinical and
      laboratory parameters, viremia and antibody levels will be assess. The goal is to expand the
      data set of symptoms produced by uncomplicated dengue-like illness.
