  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of an extract of brown seaweed, called alginate, on
      fat digestion. The extract has been cooked into sausages and the alginate sausages will be
      compared to the same sausages that do not contain alginate. People taking part in the study
      will come to the study centre twice. Once to have the alginate sausage meal or the normal
      sausage meal and on the second visit they will have the other meal so then end up having had
      both types of sausages. The level of fat in their blood will be monitored over the four hours
      after the meal. The rate and amount of fat that moves into the blood after a meal is an
      indication of the amount of fat digestion. We believe that less fat will be digested and move
      into the blood when the volunteers eat the alginate sausages compared to the normal sausages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alginate is an extract of brown seaweed and has been shown to reduce lipase activity in
      vitro. Lipase is a valid target for anti-obesity products as shown by the pharmaceutical drug
      orlistat which targets the same enzyme. Reducing the amount of lipase activity will reduce
      the amount of triacylglycerol (TAG) that will be digested and therefore absorbed and will be
      seen as a reduction in the level of circulating TAG in the blood. Adding alginate to a range
      of food products that are simple to include into the diet could help with the management of
      obesity. In this study, sausages containing alginate have been manufactured for us along with
      matched control sausage. The circulating TAG in the blood will be measured via fingerpick
      blood samples every 30 minutes for four hours after the volunteers have eaten either alginate
      sausages or normal sausages. The volunteers will come for two visits and consume the other
      sausage meal at the second so they will have had both types of sausage.
