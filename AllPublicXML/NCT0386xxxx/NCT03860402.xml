  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to compare the onset and duration of nerve blockage with the use
      of pre-warmed (38°C) and room temperature (20°C) local anesthetic solutions (ropivacaine and
      fentanyl) on epidural anesthesia for cesarean section, and compare the incidence of
      complications such as hypotension, nausea and vomiting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia has a shorter time to onset than epidural anesthesia, and the amount of
      local anesthetic administered is lower than that of epidural anesthesia, resulting in less
      systemic toxicity and superior block effect.

      However, there are disadvantage that it is difficult to control the block height and the
      incidence of hypotension is high.

      On the other hand, epidural anesthesia has the advantages of less sudden hypotension due to
      slow autonomic blockade, but it has a disadvantage that sensory nerve and motor nerve block
      time is delayed compared to spinal anesthesia.

      The degree of nerve block for cesarean section surgery requires a high level of anesthesia
      above the T6 level, so the frequency of hypotension is high due to rapid sympathetic block
      after spinal anesthesia.

      In this respect, hemodynamically stable epidural anesthesia is preferred when performing
      anesthesia for cesarean section.

      The investigators are going to compare the onset and duration of nerve blockage with the use
      of pre-warmed (38°C) and room temperature (20°C) local anesthetic solutions (ropivacaine and
      fentanyl) on epidural anesthesia for cesarean section, and compare the incidence of
      complications such as hypotension, nausea and vomiting.

    <description>After the administration of epidural local anesthetics the sensory block level is checked every 2 minutes for 20 minutes, every 10 minutes during operating period, and every 10 minutes for 60 minutes in the recovery room. The sensory block level is assessed using the pinprick test method.</description>

    <description>When systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure is less than 60 mmHg, 30 mcg of phenylephrine is administrated. If bradycardia(HR&lt;50) is accompanied, 4mg of ephedrine is injected.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of nausea and vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of epidural injection to 1 hour after entering recovery room</time_frame>
    <description>Record the nausea and vomiting that occurred in the operating room and in the recovery room after administration of the local anesthetic. If there is nausea and vomiting after surgery, ramosetron (0.3mg) should be administered if the postoperative nausea and vomiting(PONV) grade is 1 or more and symptoms are severe enough to require medication.</description>
