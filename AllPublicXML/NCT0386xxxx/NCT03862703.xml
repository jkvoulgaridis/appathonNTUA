  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to an increase in PTSD patients seeking treatment in the Danish mental health sector and
      the addition of Complex PTSD to the ICD-11, there is a need to increase the effectiveness of
      existing treatments for PTSD. mHealth interventions have been shown to be effective in
      reducing PTSD symptoms with small to moderate effect sizes. Therefore, the implementation of
      a mHealth intervention designed for psychiatric PTSD patients as a supplement to therapy may
      increase treatment outcome. As no studies to date has explored the effects of mHealth
      interventions in the Danish mental health sector the feasibility and effect of this type of
      intervention needs testing.

      The study's primary hypothesis is that PTSD patients in a Danish psychiatric outpatient
      setting will want to use a mHealth application as a supplement to care as usual (CAU). The
      secondary hypothesis is that PTSD patients will benefit from using a mHealth application as a
      supplement to CAU The study is an investigator-initiated randomized controlled feasibility
      trial investigating PTSD help combined with CAU compared to CAU for adults with PTSD. Eighty
      patients will be recruited and receive either the mHealth intervention combined with CAU or
      CAU alone. Primary outcome is the ratio of eligible patients that agree to participate in the
      study and the level of user compliance. Secondary outcome data consists of exploratory data
      on PTSD help on PTSD symptom severity, level of psychological distress, sleep quality,
      dissociation symptoms, therapy readiness, quality of life, disability levels, recovery and
      rumination.

      This study may help increase the investigator's knowledge of possible benefits of, as well as
      potential barriers to, the implementation of mHealth tools. It may also provide a
      cost-efficient means to increase therapy outcomes and decrease the duration of suffering for
      PTSD patients in the Danish psychiatric sector.

      The primary objective for the present randomized controlled feasibility study is to assess
      the feasibility of using PTSD help in the MHS-CRD to inform a larger future RCT study. The
      secondary objective is to gather preliminary exploratory data on the effectiveness of PTSD
      help versus treatment as usual on a range of clinically relevant outcome variables, including
      exploring C-PTSD as potential moderator.

      The study is an investigator-initiated randomized controlled feasibility trial investigating
      PTSD help combined with CAU compared to CAU for adults with PTSD. The primary outcome is the
      ratio of eligible patients that agree to participate in the study and do so until the end of
      the six-week intervention period and user compliance, that is, do the patients actively use
      the system after randomization, Secondary outcome data consists of exploratory data on PTSD
      help on PTSD symptom severity, level of psychological distress, sleep quality, dissociation
      symptoms, therapy readiness, quality of life, disability levels, recovery and rumination.
      These data will be collected on PTSD help, both as standalone intervention in the six weeks
      before treatment and as a supplement to treatment during the patients' psychotherapeutic
      treatment for PTSD. The primary outcome will be assessed continuously by logging the
      patient's interactions with the application. Secondary outcomes will be assessed prior to
      randomization and start of PTSD help intervention (week 1), at post PTSD help intervention
      (week 7) and at the end of psychotherapeutic treatment (week 27-29). The design of this trial
      has been developed using the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines (Chan et al., 2013).

      Participants:

      The study will recruit patients referred with PTSD symptoms to the Center for Visitation and
      Diagnostics (CVD) under the MHS-CRD, with the following inclusion criteria: the patient 1)
      must be at least 18 years old, 2) fulfil the DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis criteria, 3) be referred to
      PTSD care package treatment (Danske regioner, pakkeforl√∏b for PTSD, 2017), 4) have access to
      a smartphone with iOS (version 10 or higher) or Android (version 5.0.1. or higher) and 5)
      provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria are patients with 1) suicidal risk, 2) ongoing
      episode of bipolar disease or psychotic disorder 3) current abuse of alcohol or drugs, 4)
      inability to understand and/or read Danish and 5) concurrent psychiatric or psychological
      treatment of PTSD outside of MHS-CRD.

      Randomization:

      Randomization is conducted through the data management software REDCap, which allows a setup
      where no one from the research team have knowledge of or access to the underlying
      computer-generated allocation sequence. The randomization uses permuted blocks with varying
      block sizes based on a computer-generated allocation sequence created by a researcher with no
      affiliation to the project. The randomization allocation ratio is 1:1. This procedure ensures
      that researchers are blind to the allocation process. The randomization procedure will be
      stratified by presence of Complex PTSD as measured with the International Trauma
      Questionnaire (Cloitre, Garvert, Brewin, Bryant, &amp; Maercker, 2013).

      Blinding:

      Assessors will be blinded to the patients' group allocation during the baseline assesment,
      all assessment post-randomization will consist solely of self-report measures administered
      via email through REDCap and logging of user activity in the app. In addition, researchers
      will be blinded during the parts of the data analysis concerning the exploratory outcome
      data, but not the feasibility outcomes as the group allocation is clear from the nature of
      the data. Participants will be blinded during baseline assesment and unblinded after group
      allocation.

      Procedure:

      Patients referred to CVD for diagnostic screening that are diagnosed with PTSD and referred
      to PTSD treatment in MHS-CRD will be invited to participate in the study by the clinician
      conducting the screening. The invitation will include a pamphlet with information about the
      study and contact information for the project. If the patient gives their consent for
      participation, he or she will be booked for an assesment interview. Patients who provide
      written consent and complete the assessment interview will be randomized if the participants
      fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients in the experimental group will after
      randomization be given immediate access to PTSD help. After three days participants will
      receive a phone call to ascertain whether they are experiencing any technical difficulties
      using the app. The second and third assessments will be administered electronically via a
      link to the questionnaires sent in an email through REDCap. (see figure 1 for a consort
      diagram)

      Interventions:

      PTSD help - experimental group:

      The PTSD help app is designed for use in preparation for and as a supplement to
      psychotherapy. Its functions include: Psychoeducation about PTSD, information about PTSD
      treatment in Denmark, instructions in techniques for relieving anxiety (such as grounding
      exercises, breathing exercises, physical exercises and calming images), help towards better
      sleep (such as guided meditations and advice for improving sleep habits and sleep
      environment), options for taking personal notes on symptoms and helpful strategies that can
      reduce distress, tools for self-assessment and monitoring of PTSD symptoms ; (Weathers et
      al., 2013) and sleep quality (Sleep Condition Indicator; (Espie et al., 2014) and a crisis
      plan with personal contacts and contact information for psychiatric emergency services.

      PTSD treatment:

      All patients in the project received PTSD treatment at one of six outpatient clinics in the
      MHS-CRD that provides PTSD treatment. All clinics complies with official Danish
      recommendations for PTSD Care Packet-treatment (CP-treatment)
      (https://www.sundhed.dk/content/cms/91/43091_pakke-belastning-tilpasningsreaktion.pdf and
      https://www.regioner.dk/media/5557/pakkeforloeb-for-ptsd-voksne.pdf). PTSD CP-treatment,
      consists of 60 hours trauma-focused group psychotherapy or 15 hours trauma-focused individual
      therapy combined with other treatment elements such as assessment, psychoeducation,
      pharmacological counselling/treatment, social skill training, meeting with social network and
      monitoring. The CP includes 75 hours of treatment totally (Table 1)

      Continuity and coherence in ongoing treatment 4 h Total 75 h

      Assessment and outcome

      Assessment interview:

      The patient's trauma history is assessed with The Trauma History Questionaire (Green, 1996),
      a 24-item self-report measure of the patient's lifetime trauma history. PTSD diagnosis and
      comorbid disorders are assessed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
      (MINI v. 7.02) (Sheenan et al., 1998), a structured diagnostic interview that assesses the
      presence of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-V. To ascertain whether the patient also
      fulfills the criteria for ICD-11 PTSD or C-PTSD, the International Trauma Questionaire is
      administered (ITQ) (Cloitre, Roberts, Bisson, &amp; Brewin, 2017). ITQ is a 23-item self-report
      questionnaire used to distinguish between PTSD and C-PTSD as defined in ICD-11. The
      Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Brief Form (PID-5-BF) (Krueger, Derringer, Markon, Watson, &amp;
      Skodol, 2013) and The Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS-BF) (Espie et al., 2014;
      Hutsebaut, Feenstra, &amp; Kamphuis, 2016) are administered to assess personality disorders. The
      PID-5-BF, a 25-item version, is scored on five subscales assessing the five traits that make
      up the maladaptive personality trait model for DSM-5, negative affect, detachment,
      antagonism, disinhibition and psychoticism. The LPFS-BF is a 12-item self-report
      questionnaire that assesses the patient's level of self- and interpersonal functioning.

      Feasibility outcome:

      The primary feasibility outcome is the proportion of eligible patients that participate in
      the study until the end. The secondary feasibility outcome is the fraction of compliant
      patients in the experimental group. Compliance is defined as the use of PTSD help functions
      (excluding self-monitoring tools) corresponding to use twice a week, assessed over 6 weeks
      pre-treatment and 29 weeks during the treatment period. Compliance data is collected from the
      tracking log of the patient's app activity through a secured webpage. In addition, compliance
      will be assessed through a user behaviour questionnaire, developed based on questionnaires
      used in earlier studies evaluating the PTSD Coach app modified for the Danish research
      context (Kuhn et al., 2014; Miner et al., 2016) (see appendix 2). The feasibility
      requirements for a future RCT will be satisfied if 50% of eligible patients agree to
      participate in the study and if 50% of patients in the intervention group are compliant with
      the use of PTSD help.

      Sample size:

      Due to a shortage of similar studies, it is not currently possible to conduct a calculation
      of optimal sample size for this study. However, as a sample size calculation is not a
      requirement for feasibility studies, and is in some cases even discouraged (Billingham,
      Whitehead, &amp; Julious, 2013), Based on existing knowledge about feasibility study methodology
      (Billingham et al., 2013; Teare et al., 2014; Whitehead, Julious, Cooper, &amp; Campbell, 2016)
      and a feasibility study of another mHealth tool in MHS-CRD (Fenger et al., 2016), the plan is
      to recruit 70 patients. With 70 patients, among which 50% are rated compliant in the primary
      outcome, the 95% confidence interval for proportion estimate would range between 38% and 62%,
      which is considered acceptable.

      Results:

      The primary outcome, acceptance of the randomization procedure and patient compliance is
      analyzed through descriptive statistics, e.g., the average usage of the system per week, as
      well as the proportion of patients that stay in study until the end. Analysis of
      between-group effects on explorative outcome measures will be analyzed with analysis of
      covariance, using the intervention arm as the main predictor, and baseline performance and
      the stratification variable from randomization as covariates. For binary outcomes (e.g.,
      compliance), logistic will be used. Due to the exploratory nature of this feasibility study,
      missing data will not be imputed. Results will be presented as covariate adjusted group
      differences or odds ratios, along with the 95% confidence interval. If the results indicate
      feasibility, the investigators will proceed to a randomized controlled efficacy study.
