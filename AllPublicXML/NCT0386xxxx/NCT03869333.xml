  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial in which a
      total of 60 subjects will receive one of three doses of InvaplexAR-DETOX or placebo (saline).
      The vaccine will be administered via IM injection on study days 1, 22, and 43. Each subject
      will receive the same formulation at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment. The
      study will be initiated with the lowest dose level (2.5 μg) and will proceed to the next
      highest dose in an escalating fashion. All safety data will be summarized and reviewed by the
      Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) prior to dose-escalation.

      Specimens will be collected at prescribed intervals to examine systemic and mucosal immune
      responses. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored during vaccination and for 28 days
      following the third vaccine dose. Additionally, a telephone follow-up will be performed at 6
      months following receipt of the final vaccination to assess for adverse events.
