  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, OSA is still
      largely under diagnosed in patients with a high cardiovascular risk. In this population the
      STOP-BANG questionnaire facilitates OSA screening. Moreover, blood bicarbonate concentration
      is a simple tool to screen for chronic respiratory disease and if elevated, is a marker of
      cardiometabolic comorbidities in obese patients. A combination of blood bicarbonate
      concentration and STOP BANG score could provide a cost-effective method of screening for OSA
      in obese patients. Such screening could enable earlier management and might significantly
      reduce the costs of treatment and improve the quality of life of patients at 2 years.

    <textblock>
      OSA is a frequent condition in the general population (3% of women and 10% of men), but
      remains largely undiagnosed. Obesity is a risk factor for OSA. Sleep apnea is associated with
      diurnal and nocturnal symptoms (snoring, somnolence, fatigue), and with increased
      cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. Currently, continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) is the gold-standard treatment for OSA and the cost-effectiveness of this treatment
      has already been demonstrated. Easy-to-use procedures to identify OSA patients earlier and
      thus to initiate treatment earlier, need to be developed and validated. The STOP-BANG
      questionnaire has been designed to facilitate the screening of OSA patients. Moreover, a
      measure of blood bicarbonate concentration is a simple method for screening for chronic
      respiratory diseases and a marker of cardiometabolic comorbidities. A combination of blood
      bicarbonate measurement and STOP-BANG score could permit earlier screening and less expensive
      care of obese patients. The hypothesize is that such OSA screening in the obese population
      (bicarbonates + STOPBANG) associated with earlier care (with treatment if necessary) could
      lead to improvement in quality of life of obese patients at 2 years.
