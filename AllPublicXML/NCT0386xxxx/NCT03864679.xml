  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is widely suggested as an important lifestyle change for weight loss, however, the
      optimal level of intensity moderate versus vigorous remains unclear. It is known that in
      athletes, during very high-intensity exercise, fat oxidation is decreased and energy is
      gained mainly from carbohydrate utilization. The aim of this study is to find an optimal
      workload based on fat oxidation rate during exercise in volunteers with a sedentary
      lifestyle.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to recruit 12 healthy volunteers with a sedentary lifestyle in the study group.
      Since different regimens (fed, fasted and moderate versus vigorous) will be compared in the
      same subjects, no control group is necessary. Subjects will perform a cycling test with 5 min
      incremental intensity exercise and 1 h cycling test exercising at a moderate-intensity (load
      will be selected after the incremental intensity exercise). The expiration of carbon dioxide
      (CO2) and consumption of oxygen (O2) will be measured, to determine the total fatty acid and
      carbohydrate oxidation during cycling. Concomitantly, it is planned to measure blood lactate
      and glucose concentrations during exercise experiments as well as a wide range of blood
      biochemistry parameters before and after exercise.

      The investigators expect to find optimal conditions for the sedentary population for burning
      of fat, which is the major source of energy during moderate-intensity exercise. Measurements
      of the fat and carbohydrate oxidation in healthy volunteers with a sedentary lifestyle will
      contribute to the understanding of exercise regimens for the most effective fat oxidation.
