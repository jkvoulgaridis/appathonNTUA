  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septoplasty/septorhinoplasty is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in ENT
      clinics. Intranasal packing is widely used post-operatively for nasal septum stabilization
      and bleeding control. Patients experience pain after septoplasty during the removal of nasal
      packing. These patients may be concerned about pain before nasal packing removal, thus
      increasing anxiety levels. Various methods are currently employed to reduce this pain.
      Anxiety is a symptom when a person does not feel safe. Anxiety levels can be objectively
      measured using different tests including Spielberger state anxiety inventory.

      In this digital era, there is a growing tendency to use the popular internet sites as
      YouTube, Google as a new electronic learning for medical information. The quality of
      information found on YouTube or other sources could be low and make people more anxious
      before a minor procedure.

      Investigators aim to evaluate the effect of visual and auditory information prepared by the
      surgeon on anxiety level of patient at nasal packing removal after
      septoplasty/septorhinoplasty. For this purpose; patients who will undergo septo and
      septorhinoplasty at Istanbul Baskent University Hospital are recruited. A video of nasal
      packing removal performed by the surgeon will be watched by the patient and Spielberger state
      anxiety inventory will be filled out before nasal packing removal. The control group will
      fill out Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory without watching the video before nasal packing
      removal. The scores of the groups will be compared and the effect of the video based
      information on anxiety will be revealed.
