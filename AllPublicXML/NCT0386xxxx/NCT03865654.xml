  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being conducted to develop consensus on surveillance mammography and
      follow-up for breast cancer survivors who are age ≥75.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a communication tool that summarizes recommendations for
      clinicians and patients for surveillance mammography and follow-up care for breast cancer
      survivors age ≥75. Developing expert-panel recommendations, examining clinician and patient
      attitudes towards these recommendations, and testing a strategy for communication of expert
      recommendations on mammography cessation through direct engagement of specialists, primary
      care clinicians (PCs), and patients.

      This is a multi-step study, the investigators will build on prior steps to develop consensus
      on surveillance mammography and follow-ups for breast cancer survivors who are age &gt;= 75.

      This study includes a physician focus group.

          -  History of stage 0-II breast cancer

             -≥1 Charlson comorbidity present72, defined as one of the following:
