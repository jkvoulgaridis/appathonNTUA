  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe (SCH
      058235/MK-0653) 10 mg administered daily in conjunction with atorvastatin in participants
      with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or in participants with coronary heart
      disease (CHD) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (≥2 risk factors) and primary
      hypercholesterolemia not controlled by a starting dose (10 mg/day) of atorvastatin.

      The primary hypothesis is that the coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg/day with atorvastatin
      therapy will result in a significantly greater proportion of participants achieving target
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (≤100 mg/dL) when compared to the atorvastatin
      administered alone.
