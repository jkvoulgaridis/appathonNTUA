  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator aimed to evaluate the long-term (up to 10 years) follow-up of the patients
      who enrolled the IVUS-XPL study (Impact of IntraVascular UltraSound Guidance on the Outcomes
      of Xience Prime Stents in Long Lesions), which was shown the superiority of IVUS-guided stent
      implantation at 1 year in terms of major adverse cardiac events.
