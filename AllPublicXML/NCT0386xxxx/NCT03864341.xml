  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot study to test the feasibility of homelessness prevention and
      substance use interventions to be delivered to at-risk patients in the Bellevue Hospital
      emergency department (ED). ED patients (n=40) found eligible for the study will complete a
      baseline assessment and receive referrals to appropriate services, with a final six-month
      follow-up assessment.

      ED patients found eligible for the study will complete a baseline survey and receive
      one-time, in person services at the time of the baseline/enrollment ED visit including
      referrals to homelessness prevention and substance use services, with a final six-month
      follow-up survey. Interim contacts at 7-10 days, 3 months, and 5 months will be used to
      assure intervention components were received and to confirm participant contact information.
