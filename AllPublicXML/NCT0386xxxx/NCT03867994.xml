  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study is intended to evaluate if carvedilol has any potential protective
      effect over atorvastatin on the development of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) following
      cardiac catheterization in patients with moderate to high risk for CIN.

      This study enrolled 150 patients planned for CC, and randomly assigned for one of the three
      groups. Group (A)include 49 patients who received two atorvastatin dose 80 mg 12 hours before
      CC and 40 mg just before CC. Group (B) include 48 patients who received 12.5 mg carvedilol
      twice daily for 7 days before CC and continue for 24hrs after the day of CC, Group (C)
      include 47 patients who only hydrated with saline. All included patients were hydrated with
      saline intravenous 0.9 sodium chloride (NaCl) at 0.5-1 mg/kg/hour for 4-6 hours before and
      4-6 hours after cardiac catheterization. Serum creatinine(Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and
      estimated glomerular filtration rate were evaluated at the baseline and after 48 from CC.
      Serum neutrophil-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was evaluated after 4 hours from CC.
