  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an on-line electronic symptom management application
      that can ultimately be used to improve clinical outcomes in patients with mRCC treated with
      cabozantinib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, prospective technology-based, clinical trial. Nine patients with mRCC
      initiating cabozantinib therapy who meet subject eligibility criteria will be enrolled in
      this study. Subjects will be given an iPOD touch with the symptom monitoring application
      installed, physical activity and blood pressure monitors. Each patient will be kept on study
      for the first 12 weeks of therapy with cabozantinib. Subjects on treatment for less than 12
      weeks will not be replaced.The symptoms and other data (physical activity, blood pressure)
      recorded electronically by the patient will be compared to symptoms recorded in the medical
      record at interval clinic visits.
