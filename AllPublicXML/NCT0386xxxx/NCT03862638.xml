  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tension headache represents a considerable social burden in terms of both costs to
      the health services and also the costs of lost productivity. Episodic tension-type headache
      can be treated with rest and analgesics, while chronic tension-type headache demands a more
      fundamental treatment.

      Effectiveness of yoga therapy in the management of chronic tension type headache is limited.
      In this study, yoga therapy was used to explore its effect on chronic tension-type headache.
