  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistani studies report non-adherence to self-management by type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients,
      and episodes of hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis as acute complications. Self-management
      guidelines include maintenance of logbooks for blood glucose, physical activity, and dietary
      intake, that affect glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and acute complications. The proposed study
      will evaluate whether mobile messaging for maintaining log books for blood glucose or
      e-device use for step count will modify HbA1c levels to be examined at three and six months
      after enrollment. In addition, episodes of acute complications and blood glucose variability
      will be correlated with daily log book maintenance and step counts.

      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs due to destruction of insulin producing beta cells in pancreas.
      T1D usually occurs in children and young individuals, and requires continuous blood glucose
      monitoring for adjustment of insulin dosage on a daily basis. Incidence of T1D has been
      increasing over the past three decades. Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis episodes are common
      adverse effects due to irregular monitoring of daily blood glucose. It is a big challenge in
      developed as well as developing countries to live with T1D due to less optimal use of timely
      entry in logbook for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Current guidelines recommend
      SMBG use in all patients with diabetes. According to a study, increased daily frequency of
      SMBG was significantly associated with lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) along with added
      benefits of fewer acute complications among children and adolescents. Available literature
      from Pakistan highlights non-adherence of T1D patients to recommended dietary advice (58.5%),
      physical activity (42.3%) and prescribed insulin regimen (88.1%). Use of mobile applications
      has been shown to increase the medication adherence and use of self-blood glucose testing.
      Increased daily step count by T1D patients helped to reduce the risk of cardiovascular
      events. A wearable e-device accompanied with an application (Fitbit App) tracks step count by
      recording data in mobile application. HbA1C levels acts as an indicator for the glycemic
      control and correlates with complications. However, HbA1C cannot determine the daily
      variability of blood glucose, thus SMBG can help predict the average daily risk reduction in
      T1D complications. The proposed study will address the adherence to standard protocols for
      maintaining home based records by patients and caregivers and insulin therapy, optimizing the
      quarterly HbA1C levels.

    <intervention_model_description>A factorial design approach will be taken to study the lifestyle change for self-management of T1D. A randomized controlled method will enroll patients in four groups. All groups will be working with a standard log book for documenting blood sugar and routine care as advise by doctors, nurses, and nutritionists. First group will be entirely of routine care follow up, second group will receive additional e-device for step count (fitbit), third group will receive routine care and e-messages as reminders to maintain a daily log book, and fourth group will be receiving e-device for step count (fitbit) and e-messages for maintain blood glucose and step count log book in addition to routine care. All four groups will be followed up for a period of six months. Log book data will be obtained at a monthly interval and HbA1c as a main outcome will be measured three times, at baseline, at three and six months.</intervention_model_description>
