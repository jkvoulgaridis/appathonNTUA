    <description>The initial dose of TAC is 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/d, taking 2 hours before and after meals. The interval is strictly 12 hours. The blood concentration is measured after taking the drug. According to the concentration of blood drug valley, the dose of tacrolimus (blood concentration of ≤10ng/ml) is adjusted. If the blood drug concentration is low, the drug dose (≤0.1mg/kg/d) is increased accordingly. After 6 months of treatment, the drug is discontinued. The TAC dose is maintained at the original dose after 6 months of treatment with complete or partial remission of urinary protein until the end of the 48-week trial.</description>
