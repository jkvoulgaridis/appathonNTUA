  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Republic of the Marshall Islands has the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in
      the world. This clinical trial tested whether a community-based, intensive, plant-rich
      lifestyle intervention with exercise is more effective for treating and managing T2D in the
      Republic of the Marshall Islands than the standard of diabetes care. The intensive lifestyle
      intervention consisted of a plant-rich diet and moderate exercise. It centered around a
      12-week program of counseling and instruction on healthy eating, exercise, and stress
      management, as well as hands-on cooking classes and prepared meals. Cardiometabolic outcomes
      were assessed throughout the intervention and at 24 weeks. The present study is the first
      randomized clinical trial ever conducted in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the
      first lifestyle intervention trial conducted in Micronesia.

    <description>The standard of diabetes care consisted of standard treatment protocols used by the MOH Diabetes Clinic. These included placing T2D patients on anti-hyperglycemic agents appropriate to their HbA1c levels (including sulfonylureas, metformin, and insulin) and providing oral and written information about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. Participants in the control group were instructed not to make changes in their diet and activity levels during the study.</description>

    <description>The lifestyle intervention consisted of a high-fiber, low-fat, mostly plant-based diet and 30-60 minutes per day of culturally-relevant, moderate intensity exercise. Participants initially received 12 weeks of group educational classes and some prepared meals and then followed the lifestyle intervention on their own for the remaining 12 weeks. Group classes included informative sessions on healthy eating, exercise (both aerobic and strength training), and stress management, as well as hands-on cooking classes. Classes were delivered as a combination of PowerPoint presentations, practical workshops, dine-outs, shopping tours, and cooking classes with spouses.</description>
