    <textblock>
      In present study, we aimed to investigate the association between erectile function severity
      of serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin-D and cut-off level to treat men with erectile dysfunction.

      Investigators retrospectively analysed 130 patients admitted to the complaint of erectile
      dysfunction between aged between 18-80 years old from June 2017 to October 2018 at Cigli
      Region Training Hospital Urology department and Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Urology
      Department. International index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5) Turkish validated short form
      quesstionaire was performed to all patients. Antropometric characteristics including weight,
      height, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) and presence of comorbide diseases were
      recorded. After detailed history and physical examination performed all patients, overnight
      fasting in the morning between 08:00-10:00, blood samples from antecubital vein were
      performed and serum glucose, lipid profile, follicular stimulating hormon (FSH), Luteinizing
      hormone (LH), total testosterone, prolactin, estradiol, 25(OH)D level were analysed. Presence
      of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled lipid metabolism
      disorders, neurological diseases, heamatological diseases, urinary tract infection,
      malignencies, chronic kidney failure, metabolic syndrome, psychiatric diseases and/or medical
      treatment, smoking, history of pelvic surgery, cardiac surgery and pelvic radiotherapy were
      accepted as exclusion criterias from the study. After IIEF-5 score adjust as 21 point, ROC
      analyse was used to calculate the cut-off value of 25(OH)D and level of 27.32 ng/mL was
      calculated as cut-off value. Patients were divided into two group according to 27.32 ng/mL
      level as a cut off value. Serum 25(OH)D level was lower than 27.32 ng/mL in group 1 (severe
      and moderate symptomatic group) and higher than 27.32 ng/mL in group 2 (mild symptomatic
      group).
