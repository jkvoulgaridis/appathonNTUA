  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis in a systemic disease that effects many systems of the body. few studies examined
      the hearing function of these patients but the results were inconclusive. No study, however,
      investigated the vestibular function of psoriatic patients.

      In a prospective study, the investigators will compare audiovestibular function between
      psoriatic patients and healthy volunteers. .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whether psoriatic patients have higher risk for developing inner ear dysfunction (hearing
      loss and dizziness) is an important issue that needs to be elucidated. Awareness to the
      elevated risk (if there is any) of inner ear impairment, early detection and treatment of the
      condition may reduce the morbidities resulting from undiagnosed audiovestibular impairment.

      In a prospective study the investigators will examine the inner ear function (vestibular and
      auditory) of psoriatic patients and compare it to an healthy, young control group.

      The study will include 2 groups of participants: psoriatic patients and healthy volunteers.
      psoriatic patients are recruited from the dermatology clinic while the healthy volunteers are
      members of the hospital staff.

      The participants will undergo 2 sets of examinations:

        1. auditory function examination: hearing test (that includes pure tone audiometry, speech
           audiometry and discrimination level), tympanometry and otoacoustic emissions.

        2. vestibular function examination:

             -  Video head impulse test: a ten-minute, non- invasive test that includes a computer
                and a set of goggles worn by the participant. The participants is sitting in front
                of a wall while wearing the goggles, the investigator moves the participant's head
                sideways with short, rapid movements. the computer calculates the accuracy and the
                velocity of the eyes movements.

             -  The participants fills a dizziness handicap inventory questionnaire. The
                participants from the psoriatic group are recruited from the dermatology clinic.
                The healthy group participants are members of the hospital staff and are recruited
                from the hospital.
