    <textblock>
      Based on the results of the Phase 2 Study 191622-130, the current Phase 2b study is designed
      to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of BOTOX for the treatment of Masseter Muscle
      Prominence (MMP) in adults.

    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>MMPS-P is based on an adaptation of the clinician MMPS. Participants will be asked to assess the severity of their masseter prominence using a single questionnaire composed of 5 grades (1 = not at all pronounced, 2 = mildly pronounced, 3 = moderately pronounced, 4 = pronounced, 5 = very pronounced).</description>

    <measure>Proportion of responders who achieve Participant Self-Assessment of Change in MMP (PSAC) PSAC Grade ≥ 2 (at least moderately improved from baseline) at Day 90, per participant using the PSAC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>The PSAC is a commonly used assessment of change scale that has been adapted for use with MMP. Participants will be asked to assess the degree of change of their MMP using a single item composed of 7 grades (3 = much improved, 2 = moderately improved, 1 = minimally improved, 0 = no change, -1 = minimally worse, -2 = moderately worse, -3 = much worse).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Participant has bilateral MMP (identical grades for left and right masseter), as
             determined at the Day 1 visit by the investigator using the MMPS

          -  Participant has bilateral MMP, as determined at the Day 1 visit by the participant
             using the MMPS-P

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≤ 30 kg/m2 using the calculation: BMI = weight (kg) [height
             (m)]2

          -  Female participants willing to minimize the risk of inducing pregnancy for the
             duration of the clinical study and follow-up period. A female participant is eligible
             to participate if she is not pregnant (has a negative urine pregnancy result prior to
             randomization), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions
             applies:

               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR

               2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment and
                  follow-up period

             exposure to BOTOX, including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other condition that might interfere with
             neuromuscular function

          -  Current or planned dental or facial procedures during the study period (eg, braces,
             dental implants, and reconstructive or aesthetic surgery) that could interfere with

             a study within 30 days of entry into this study

             infection requiring medical treatment in the opinion of the investigator

          -  History of or current TMJD, or presence of signs/symptoms of possible TMJD, in the
             opinion of the investigator

          -  Weakness of the masseter, pterygoid, or temporalis muscles due to trauma, facial nerve
             injury, or other condition that could interfere with normal chewing and jaw clenching,
             as determined by the investigator

          -  Excess lower facial fat, loose or lax skin in lower face, or parotid gland prominence
             that could interfere with MMPS, as determined by the investigator

          -  Significant asymmetry of left and right sides of the face that could prevent identical
             MMPS grading on both sides of the face, as determined by the investigator

          -  Masseter prominence due to other etiologies (eg, parotid gland infection, parotiditis,
             malignancy) based upon findings from the oral examination
