  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For cancers, such as mesothelioma, that spread to the lining of the stomach, detecting the
      cancer is very difficult with CT or MRI scans. Researchers at the University of Chicago want
      to find out if the new experimental MRI and ultrasound imaging techniques do a better job of
      detecting these cancers. Researchers will use new MRI and ultrasound techniques to see if it
      can find evidence of cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdomen, and right now these
      new techniques are only used for research.

    <description>The first 5 patients will undergo HR-MRI scans using different sequence parameters. Results in these patients will then be assessed along with standard CT Imaging to determine which sequences appear to best identify peritoneal disease. The optimal HR-MRI sequences will then be used for the next 19 patients in the Testing phase to formally define their performance compared to standard imaging.</description>
