  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that involves human subjects undergoing cystectomy surgery for bladder
      cancer, testing the utilization of a mobile health app that promotes postoperative patient
      engagement, along with provider monitoring and care. The aim of this pilot study is to assess
      feasibility and acceptability of an Internet-based mobile health tool following cystectomy
      discharge. Objectives will be met by assessing weekly adherence, determining acceptability of
      mobile health questions post-surgery by patients and providers, and by obtaining participant
      feedback regarding the tool. Complications, re-admissions, and resource utilization will also
      be monitored throughout the study. The hypothesis is that an mobile health intervention that
      tracks PROs, provides educational content, and allows real-time feedback via internet-enabled
      devices has the potential to improve the quality of care delivery and overall patient
      experience following surgery by decreasing resource utilization and improving symptom control
      and communication.

      Radical cystectomy will be used as a model to examine the utilization of an electronic,
      internet-based mobile health intervention that can prospectively collect PRO data while
      providing timely feedback to patients and clinicians. This mobile health intervention will
      utilize a well-established platform (Twistle) that can be accessed through multiple
      technologies, including laptops, smartphones, and other computer-based systems. The objective
      is to evaluate the feasibility of pre-specified Patient Reported Outcomes and educational
      content in an existing mobile health communications platform which tracks patient symptoms
      and provides real-time feedback to patients and providers following cystectomy discharge.
      Patient Reported Outcome questions and responses will be inputted using validated questions
      with branching logic to drive feedback based upon responses. The intent of this study is to
      evaluate feasibility and acceptability of this mobile health tool following cystectomy
      discharge. Usual care will continue in coordination with this intervention.
