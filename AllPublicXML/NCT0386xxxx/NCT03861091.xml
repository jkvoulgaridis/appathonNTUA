  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind randomized controlled study investigating the efficacy of a single
      dose of 150 mg risedronate (a bone anti-resorptive) vs a single dose of placebo given prior
      to SBRT for peripheral lung tumors that are within 2 cm of the chest wall. Our hypothesis is
      that the use of a single dose of 150 mg risedronate will eliminate or greatly reduce the
      rapid bone loss that occurs with radiation induced early osteoclast recruitment/activation.

      Patients will be given either a single dose of 150 mg risedronate or placebo at the time of
      their treatment mapping &quot;simulation&quot; CT scan. Typically, radiation treatments begin at 1 - 3
      weeks following this mapping scan, as each treatment plan requires detailed physics
      calculations and quality assurance checks.

      All CT imaging referenced below is performed as a routine standard of care surveillance and
      is necessary for cancer treatment follow-up. These chest CT scans that are utilized in this
      research protocol would be performed every 3 months regardless of inclusion on this trial.

      2.1 Primary Objective(s)

      The primary objective is to assess the percent change in bone mean cortical thickness within
      regions of bone receiving 30 Gy or more at 3 months after SBRT. The % change in mean cortical
      thickness will be compared between patients who received risedronate and those who received
      placebo.

      2.2 Secondary Objective(s)

      In addition to the primary objective, the investigators will further analyze the remaining
      routine follow-up chest CT scans, for mean cortical thickness change in regions of bone that
      received 0 - 10 Gy, &gt;10 - 20 Gy, &gt; 20 - 30 Gy, &gt; 30 - 40 Gy, and &gt; 40 Gy at all time points
      including 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. These scans are standard of care and
      would be performed regardless of inclusion on this trial. This will allow us to determine the
      potential persistence of effects from SBRT and bisphosphonate use.

      The investigators will assess and compare the incidence and grade (per modified CTCAE v.5) of
      radiation induced chest wall pain within the radiation treatment portal (within the 50%
      isodose line) at time of each routine follow up visit (3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12
      months post SBRT). The purpose of utilizing a placebo and double-blind design is that chest
      wall pain is a subjective finding. Furthermore, it is unclear if chest wall pain from
      radiation is directly due to bone damage, nerve damage, muscle irritation, or a combination
      of all of these factors. The use of placebo will help us reduce the potential for bias in
      pain assessment.

      The investigators will assess and compare the incidence of rib and vertebral fractures (as
      noted on CT imaging) that occur within 12 months of irradiation and are within the radiation
      treatment field. The radiation treatment field will be defined as within the 50% isodose
      line.

      The urine concentration of an osteoclast-specific biomarker, urinary N-telopeptide (NTX)
      indicating osteoclast activity will be assessed prior to SBRT and at each routine follow up
      visit (at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post SBRT).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be 18 years or older, but there is no upper limit on age of inclusion.

          -  Patients must have a peripheral lung tumor that is amenable to SBRT as determined by
             the treating radiation oncologist. To be classified as a peripheral lung tumor, the
             tumor edge (the edge of the gross tumor volume or GTV in radiation treatment planning
             software) must be within 2 cm of the chest wall. This is determined by the treating
             radiation oncologist. The chest wall is defined as the chest wall musculature or
             ribs/vertebrae immediately adjacent to the lungs.

          -  Patients must have ECOG status of 0-3

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months as determined by the
             treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign an
             IRB-approved informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Prior radiation to any part of the body including the lungs or thorax is not an exclusion
        criteria

          -  Tumor edge is greater than 2 cm from the chest wall. The edge of tumor is the edge of
             the gross tumor volume or GTV as defined in radiation treatment planning software.
             This is determined by the treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Tumors that are expected to require more than 10 fractions of radiation as determined
             by the treating radiation oncologist.

          -  History of using bone anti-resorptive agents including bisphosphonates or RANK-L
             inhibitors within the last 1 year.

          -  Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes, which is necessary for
             ingestion of risedronate.

          -  Hypocalcemia defined as serum total calcium lower than 8.5 mg/dL on bloodwork within 3
             months of administration of study drug/placebo.

          -  Severe renal impairment (EGFR &lt;30 mL/min) on bloodwork within 3 months of
             administration of study drug/placebo.

          -  Known allergy to risedronate or other bisphosphonates

          -  Surgery affecting the bone or dental operations within the last 6 months. This will be
             explicitly asked and documented in the EMR by treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Dental operations do not include routine cleaning or cavity fillings

          -  Dental operations that exclude patients refer to any manipulation of mandible.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential within 1 week of
             registration. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation has clear
             teratogenic and potentially abortifacient risks.
