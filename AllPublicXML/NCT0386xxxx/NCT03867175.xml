  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies immunotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy to see how
      well it works compared with immunotherapy alone after first-line systemic therapy (therapy
      that goes throughout the body) in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and
      deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer
      doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving immunotherapy with
      stereotactic body radiation therapy may work better than immunotherapy alone in treating
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival of patients randomized to radiation and consolidative
      immunotherapy against those receiving consolidative immunotherapy alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate overall survival in all patients and will compare overall survival of those
      randomized to radiation and consolidative immunotherapy against those receiving consolidative
      immunotherapy alone.

      II. In patients receiving radiation, to describe the rate of in-field local control and rate
      of out-of-field disease progression with serial imaging.

      III. In patients not receiving radiation, describe progression at known sites of disease
      after first line systemic therapy and rate of development of new metastases with serial
      imaging.

      IV. To evaluate toxicity associated with radiation followed by consolidative immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo 3-10 treatments of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
      Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3-4 weeks for 1
      year at the discretion of the treating physician.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3-4 weeks for 1 year at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.

    <description>All safety measures, including acute and late toxicity, will be reported using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, proportions, and 95% confidence intervals). This will include calculating frequency/risk of adverse events by treatment site. Potential toxicities reported would include pneumonitis, esophagitis, chest wall pain, dermatologic toxicity, renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal toxicity including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and abdominal pain. These toxicities would be assessed according to site of irradiation by the treating physician and graded as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are 18 years or older.

          -  Pathologically proven non-small cell lung cancer with evidence of metastatic disease

          -  Must have received 4 cycles of standard of care chemo-immunotherapy and have no
             evidence of disease progression at time of restaging with PET and MRI brain.

          -  Metastatic lesions must be amenable to local radiotherapy per treating radiation
             oncologist.

          -  Patients who previously had earlier stage NSCLC treated definitively and have now
             developed new distant disease, are eligible for inclusion if they have undergone at
             least 4 cycles of chemo-immunotherapy for their metastatic recurrence and restaging
             demonstrates no evidence of progression.

          -  The maximum number of residual sites of disease will be eight total at time of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients must have at least one residual site of disease which can be identified by CT
             or PET/CT.

          -  The primary and or regional lymph nodes will count together as one site and any number
             of CNS lesions treated with stereotactic radiation will be cumulatively counted as 1
             site. Treatment of CNS disease with stereotactic radiosurgery may take place prior to
             completion of first line chemotherapy. However, if CNS disease was treated prior to
             systemic therapy this will still be counted as 1 site of disease at time of
             randomization.

          -  Patients may have a history of prior radiation, however the treating radiation
             oncologist must assess prior to enrollment to ensure that reasonable dosimetric
             constraints can be met.

          -  There are no strict size or tumor number limitations in lung, liver, abdomen pelvis,
             or spine organ sites, however the treating radiation oncologist must agree that
             dosimetric constraints are likely to be respected if all known sites of disease remain
             stable following line systemic therapy.

          -  Patients with two lung lesions determined by the treating clinician to be synchronous
             early-stage primary cancers will not be eligible.

          -  T1-4N1-3 disease may be treated with more fractionated (non-SBRT) radiation therapy
             using 2 to 7 weeks of daily radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemoradiation if
             the treatment site cannot be safely treated with SBRT. This decision is at the
             discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Performance Status 0-2 (ECOG) at Randomization

          -  A signed study specific consent form is required.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine - within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance greater than
             60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  The patient has received treatment for other carcinomas within the last three years
             (Except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer, low-risk prostate cancer, T1/T2 glottic
             cancer, stage 0 or stage I breast cancer, non-invasive bladder cancer, or treated
             in-situ cervical cancer). Prior lung cancer diagnosis is not an exclusion criteria.

          -  Patients with major activating mutations in EGFR (del19, L858R, and T790M) or ROS 1 or
             ALK gene rearrangements are excluded.

          -  Patients with two lung lesions determined by the treating clinician to be synchronous
             early-stage primary cancers will not be eligible.
