      This is a single-arm, single centre open-label, phase II interventional clinical trial of
      combination immunotherapy with Nivolumab and Relatlimab in mCRC.

      Patients with metastatic RAS/RAF WT colorectal cancer who have previously had a radiological
      response to EGFR inhibitors i.e. Cetuximab or Panitumumab, either combined with chemotherapy
      or as single agents, but subsequently experienced progression of their disease will be
      eligible for the study. They will consent to the study ideally within 3 months having
      progressed/ become refractory to EGFR blockable and undergo a mandatory baseline biopsy
      within this time period.

      Patients will receive Nivolumab and Relatlimab every 4 weeks and will start on study
      treatment as soon as possible after the baseline biopsy. After starting on the study drugs,
      there will be a mandatory 'on-treatment' biopsy at day 21 ± 3 days. Response assessments in
      the form of either CT or MRI scans will take place every 8 weeks throughout the study for the
      12 months and every 12 weeks from 12 months onwards. Patients will continue on the study
      until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed by RECIST 1.1 or when maximum duration of
      treatment of 24 months has been reached

      There will be the possibility of 'treating beyond progression' if participants are deriving
      clinical benefit from treatment to encompass the possibility of pseudoprogression. At PD
      participants will undergo a further biopsy. The investigators envisage enrolling a total of
      25 participants and the investigators anticipate 30 months as a feasible time frame for
      accrual.
