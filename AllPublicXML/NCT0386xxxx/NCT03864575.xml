  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and the anti-tumor activity of the
      combination of nivolumab and celecoxib.

      The total numbers of participants to be enrolled will be up to 68 participants, depending on
      the investigated dose of celecoxib during the safety run-in phase.
