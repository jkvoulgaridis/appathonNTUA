      This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, phase IIa study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of oral LAT8881 in neuropathic pain. After a one week
      baseline period, subjects entered into the study will be randomised to receive
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (LAT8881 or placebo) twice daily for four weeks.

      The first treatment period will be followed by a washout period of two weeks and then a
      second baseline period of one week. Subjects will not take any IMP over these three weeks.

      After the second baseline period, subjects will cross over to receive the second treatment
      (either LAT8881 or placebo, whichever treatment was not received in the first treatment
      period) twice daily for four weeks.

      The pharmacokinetics (PK) of LAT8881 will be investigated in 15 subjects (PK subjects) at
      selected Australian sites. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) for Warm Detection Threshold
      (WDT), Mechanical Pain Sensitivity (MPS) and Heat Pain Threshold (HPT) will be performed in
      at least 20 subjects (QST subjects) in each treatment period, before the first dose and on
      the last day of each period. No subject will have both PK and QST analyses.

    <intervention_model_description>This is the first study with LAT8881 in subjects with neuropathic pain. As such, it has been designed to evaluate, in a well-defined patient group, the concept that LAT8881 is safe and effective in this indication.
Subjects enrolled into this study have been diagnosed with Post Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) or Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), both conditions being well accepted examples of neuropathic pain. Because the pain is chronic, without a period effect, and treatment is symptomatic rather than curative, a crossover study is considered appropriate. Studies with other agents have successfully demonstrated analgesic effects in PHN and DPN with a crossover study design</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme e.g. &quot;no pain&quot; to '10' representing the other pain extreme e.g. &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;
We will be evaluating the efficacy of oral LAT8881 in neuropathic pain compared with placebo when assessed by change in mean pain intensity scores, using this 11 point numeric pain rating scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in functioning as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Interference Scale (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory Interference Scale (BPI) assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. Patients are asked to assess the level of interference experienced across seven items; general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life. Patients are asked to rate the level of interference experienced for each of these items, with a &quot;0&quot; meaning &quot;no interference, and a &quot;10&quot;, at the top end of the scale, meaning &quot;complete interference&quot;.
The BPI will be evaluating the effects of oral LAT8881, compared with placebo, on functioning in subjects with neuropathic pain when measured by the 7-item short form BPI Interference Scale.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change is a self-rated measure, where patients are asked to describe the change, if any, since beginning treatment, in: activity limitations, symptoms, emotions and overall quality of life related to their neuropathic pain. Patients are asked to rate the change, if any, for these items on a 7-point scale, where &quot;0&quot; equals &quot;no change&quot;, through to &quot;7&quot;, meaning &quot;a great deal better&quot;.
The PGIC is being used to evaluate the effect of oral LAT8881, compared with placebo, on overall health and quality of life in subjects with neuropathic pain,.</description>
