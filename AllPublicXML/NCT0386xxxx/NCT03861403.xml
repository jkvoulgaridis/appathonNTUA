  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a dose escalation and expansion, multi-center study to be conducted in 2
      phases:

        -  Phase 1b

             -  Dose Escalation Part 1 (Doublet Therapy)

             -  Dose Escalation Part 2 (Triplet Therapy)

        -  Phase 2a

             -  Dose Expansion (Triplet Therapy)

      Approximately 125 adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors
      requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study. It is expected that approximately 24
      patients will be enrolled in up to 4 cohorts, 2 cohorts in Dose Escalation Part 1 and 2
      cohorts in Dose Escalation Part 2, of up to 6 patients per cohort. Up to 98 additional
      patients will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase of the study to achieve 88 evaluable
      patients (i.e., received at least 1 dose of study drug(s) and have 1 evaluable post-baseline
      modified RECIST v1.1 tumor response assessment; for mCRPC, assessment of soft tissue response
      will be per modified RECIST v1.1 and bone progression assessment will be per PCWG3 guidelines
      or discontinued treatment due to death, toxicity, or clinical progression) over 4 independent
      expansion groups.In either phase (1b or 2a), patients discontinuing for reasons unrelated to
      study treatment toxicity prior to completion of Cycle (C) 1 may be replaced to achieve the
      number of required evaluable patients per cancer type following consultation with the
      Sponsor. Data from each cohort in the Dose Escalation phase will be evaluated independently
      for safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) prior to dose escalation and again prior to
      the Dose Expansion phase.
