  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the CleanSweep™ Closed Suction System on time to
      first successful spontaneous breathing trial in mechanically ventilated patients in the
      medical intensive care unit. Secondary aims of this study are to evaluate the use
      endotracheal tube sweeping compared to closed suctioning effect on length of mechanical
      ventilation, length of ICU stay, length of total hospital stay, and occurrence of
      ventilator-associated events.

      This is designed as a prospective, randomized control trial, in a large, urban, academic
      medical center. This study will include mechanically ventilated patients (n = 272) in the
      medical intensive care unit (MICU) at Rush University Medical Center. It will exclude
      patients with a tracheostomy on admission, those requiring extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO), or transferred from an outside facility receiving more than 24 hours of
      mechanical ventilation. Two groups will be randomly assigned via computer randomization. The
      experimental group will be placed on the CleanSweep™ Closed Suction System immediately after
      intubation or upon arrival to the MICU. Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) will be cleaned with the
      balloon sweeping technology every time a respiratory therapist suctions the patient. The
      control group will be placed on the standard in-line suction device. Airway suctioning will
      be performed in both groups as per department policy (Catheter advanced until resistance is
      met and withdrawn slowly for a duration no longer than 15 seconds while applying negative
      pressure). Both groups will also receive a ventilator bundle that consists of head of bed
      elevation, ETT cuff pressure management, deep vein thrombosis prevention, daily sedation
      interruption and SBT, and oral care every 4 hours with chlorhexidine at 12pm (noon) and 12am
      midnight.
