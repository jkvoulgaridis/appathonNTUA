  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether adding phone coaching to an Internet-based
      weight loss program can improve weight loss outcomes at 4 months and 1 year. All individuals
      will receive a 4-month, Internet-delivered weight loss program followed by an 8-month
      Internet-delivered weight loss maintenance program. Some individuals will also be selected to
      receive either 3 weeks or 12 weeks of phone coaching. Assessments of weight, diet, physical
      activity, and psychosocial factors will occur at baseline, 4 months, and 1 year.

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will receive a 4-month, Internet-delivered weight loss program followed by an 8-month, Internet-delivered weight loss maintenance program. All individuals will be taught behavioral strategies for changing diet and physical activity behaviors via video lessons. Some participants in this group will also be selected to receive a brief period (i.e., once/week for 3 weeks) of phone coaching starting at week 5. The first coaching call will be approximately 45 minutes in duration and remaining calls with be 10-15 minutes. Coaches will problem solve with participants and help them develop an individualized meal plan.</description>
