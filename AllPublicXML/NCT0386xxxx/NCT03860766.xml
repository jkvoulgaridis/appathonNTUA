  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Photobiomodulation has been explored for years, with wide clinical use for wound
      healing and analgesia in varied orthopedic conditions, but the number of research and
      clinical use has increased during the last decade. Furthermore, considering the performance,
      the current literature is conflicting and restricted, with divergences in wavelength, power
      and energy density applied. Therefore, analyze different doses for a answer in short and long
      time, associated with capacities of strength, fatigue resistance and functional performance
      of handball players becomes necessary. Objective: To analyze the effects of the application
      of LED phototherapy on the capacities of strength, functional efficiency, temperature and
      fatigue resistance of handball players.Method: The study sample will be composed of 56 male
      handball players randomly allocated into four groups: LED 50J (G-50J), LED 240J (G-240J), LED
      50-240J (G-50-240J) - progressive dose and Sham (G-S). The athletes will be submitted to a
      evaluations of muscle performance and functional performance, metabolic and physiological
      evaluation. After initial tests, in six consecutives weeks the LEDT (940nm - infrared) will
      be applied to the quadriceps femoris muscle and hamstrings, bilaterally, associated with a
      muscle strength protocol. Also, at the end of the second and fourth week there will be
      evaluations of muscular, metabolic and physiological performance. After 24 hours of the last
      application TLED the tests will be repeated. Seven days after the last intervention will be
      performed a follow-up. For analysis, normality test will be used to verify the distribution
      and adequate statistical tests for the appropriate intra and intergroup comparisons, being
      considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. A significance level of 5% will be
      adopted.

  <detailed_description>

      It is a blinded randomized clinical trial. The athletes will undergo pre-evaluation, 6 weeks
      of training associated with LED application, being distributed in two applications per week
      and a re-evaluation 24 hours after the last application, totaling a total of approximately 8
      weeks. Thus, on the first day (Pre-test) athletes will be submitted to anthropometric
      evaluation, blood sample collection for evaluation of basal blood lactate levels, as well as
      evaluation by bioimpedance for analysis of detailed body composition. Then, the maximum
      voluntary contraction test (CVM) will be performed on the isokinetic dynamometer, together
      with the electromyographic evaluation. Before and after the evaluation with the isokinetic
      dynamometer, thermography and plethysmography will be collected.

      After 24 hours, the vertical jump test will be performed and after 15 minutes of passive
      rest, the athlete will perform the incremental test.

      After the initial evaluations, the researcher will go to the training center of the team to
      apply the respective interventions, which consist of applying LEDs all over the quadriceps
      and hamstring bilaterally, while the sham group (GS) will receive the LED application off,
      without the emission of light. The application will occur for six weeks, and will occur twice
      weekly, on days spaced for at least 48 hours. The same will be done in conjunction with the
      lower limb strength training protocol.

      The tests performed at the time of pre-application of the LED (Pre-test) will be reapplied in
      the same order 24 hours after the last application of the interventions. The isokinetic
      evaluation, together with electromyography, plethysmography and thermography of the
      quadriceps bilaterally, will also be performed after two and four weeks of intervention.
      After seven days of the last application, the isokinetic evaluation, electromyography,
      vertical jump evaluation and incremental test will be performed. In addition, at the end of
      the second and fourth week the volunteer will carry out an evaluation with the isokinetic
      dynamometer, electromyography, plethysmography and thermography.
