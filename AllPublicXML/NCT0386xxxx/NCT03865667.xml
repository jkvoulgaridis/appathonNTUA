  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) components marketed in
      the European Union (EU). These types of studies are required by regulatory authorities for
      all THA devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence available at the time
      of gaining approval to market in Europe. This study has been designed in accordance with the
      medial device directives (MEDDEV) 2.12/2 rev 2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is to evaluate component survivorship of the PROFEMUR® Preserve Femoral Stem and CoCr Modular Neck out to 10 years follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of hips survived with no revision or replacement at 10-year.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the cumulative incidence of component revision at specified intervals out to 10 years follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of hips that were revised or replaced at each of the intervals namely for Early (2-5 years), midterm (5-7 Year), and long-term (10-year) evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize functional scores, as assessed by Oxford Hip and EQ-5D-3L scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be reporting the final Oxford Hip score, which is a summary over 12 items. Each of these items is 5-level Likert scale such as from 'not at all' to 'totally'. EQ-5D-3L data will be summarized over 5 domains, namely, mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the presence and the zones of radiolucencies surrounding the implanted femoral components.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Radiolucencies are described around 7 zones and we will be reporting the number of hips with radiolucencies present at a given zone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate cup inclination.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cup inclination is an angle measure, which is captured as a continuous variables. We will present the mean and standard deviation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize of adverse events and adverse device effects.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-5 years, 5-7 years, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events will be summarized as the total number of Adverse Events (AE), Adverse Device Effect (ADE) by grade, severity, and relationship to the device and surgery. Number of patients experiencing such AEs and ADEs will be also provided.</description>

        Newly or previously implanted subjects must meet all the following inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone primary Total Hip Arthroscopy for any of the following:

          -  Non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis, avascular
             necrosis, ankylosis, protrusio acetabuli, or painful hip dysplasia;lnflammatory
             degenerative joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis; or

          -  Correction of functional deformity;

          -  Subject is implanted with the PROFEMUR® Preserve Femoral Stem(s) and cobalt-chromium
             Modular Neck;

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits or assessments through
             the 10 year postoperative follow-up schedule;

          -  Subject is implanted with WMT or MPO head, cup and liner.

        Newly or previously implanted bilateral subjects can have both Total Hip Arthroscopy
        enrolled in the study provided: 1) the specified PROFEMUR® Preserve Femoral Stems and
        cobalt-chromium Modular Necks were implanted in both, 2) all other aspects of the
        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are satisfied, 3) enrollment does not exceed the subject count

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

          -  Subjects implanted with non-MicroPort or Wright Medical Technology components (femoral
             heads, acetabular shells, acetabular liners);

             Neck;

          -  Subjects skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of primary Total Hip
             Arthroscopy surgery;

          -  Subjects have or had an overt infection at the time of implantation;

          -  Subjects have or had a distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread

             bone absorption apparent on roentgenogram at time of implantation;

          -  Subjects have or had inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion
             and/or inadequate abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the
             joint which would make the procedure unjustifiable;

          -  Subject has neuropathic joints;

          -  Subject has hepatitis or HIV infection;

          -  Subject has a neurological or musculoskeletal disease that may adversely affect gait
             or weight-bearing;

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in another clinical study which could affect the endpoints
             of this protocol;

          -  Subjects unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document;

          -  Subjects with documented substance abuse issues;
