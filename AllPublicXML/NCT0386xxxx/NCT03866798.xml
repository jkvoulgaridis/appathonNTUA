          1. Females and males aged from ≥1 year to &lt;18 years old

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) according to American
             Society of Hematology (ASH) 2011 guidelines

          3. Platelets count &lt;30x109/L at the Baseline Visit

          4. Voluntarily given written informed consent (provided by patient's parent or legal
             guardian) and assent (provided by patient [if age-appropriate per IRB (Institutional
             Review Board) requirements])

          5. Females of childbearing potential have been using at least 1 acceptable form of birth
             control for a minimum of 30 days (or a minimum of 3 months for hormonal
             contraceptives) prior to the Screening visit, and must agree to use at least 1
             acceptable method of contraception for 30 days after the last dose of PANZYGA.
             Acceptable methods of birth control for this study include: intrauterine device (IUD),
             hormonal contraception, male or female condom, spermicide gel, diaphragm, sponge, or
             cervical cap. Abstinence is not considered an acceptable method of birth control.

          6. Parent or legal guardian must agree and be willing to assist the participant attend
             study visits, and to follow all protocol requirements and instructions of the study
             doctor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Thrombocytopenia secondary to other diseases (such as Acquired Immunodeficiency
             Syndrome [AIDS] or systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), drug-related thrombocytopenia,
             or congenital thrombocytopenia

          2. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) or anti-D immunoglobulin within 3
             weeks before enrollment

          3. Administration of thrombopoietin receptor agonists when the dose has NOT been stable
             within 3 weeks before enrollment and a dosage change is planned before Day 32

          4. Administration of oral immunosuppressants when the dose has NOT been stable during the
             preceding 2 months (2 weeks for long-term corticosteroid therapy) and a dosage change
             is planned before Day 32 (Note: topical agents and inhaled corticosteroid therapy use
             is permitted)

          5. Administration of long-term anti-prolific agents or attenuated androgen therapy when
             the dose has NOT been stable during the preceding 2 months and a dosage change is
             planned before Day 32

          6. Nonresponsive to previous treatment with IGIV or anti-D immunoglobulin

          7. Evidence of an active major bleeding episode at Screening

          8. Splenectomy in the previous 4 weeks or planned splenectomy throughout the study period

             autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and/or autoimmune
             neutropenia)

         10. Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and/or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections

         11. Emergency surgery in the previous 4 weeks

         12. Severe liver and/or kidney disease (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;3x upper limit of
             normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt;3x upper limit of normal (ULN), and/or
             creatinine &gt;120 µmol/L)

         13. History of severe hypersensitivity to blood or plasma derived products, or any
             component of the PANZYGA

         14. Known immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency and antibodies against IgA

         15. History of, or suspected alcohol or drug abuse in the previous year

             entry

         19. Risk factors* for thromboembolic events in whom the risks outweigh the potential
             benefit of PANZYGA treatment.

         20. Any other condition(s), that in the Investigator's opinion, make it undesirable for
             the patient to participate in the study or may interfere with protocol compliance.
