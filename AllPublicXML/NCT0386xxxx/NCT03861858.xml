    <textblock>
      This project expands our existing psychological services clinic (the Dialectical Behavior
      Therapy Clinic at Rutgers University; DBT-RU) to include an adolescent treatment arm.
      Adolescents aged 13-20 and at least one caregiver will be recruited to participate in a
      six-month treatment study. Adolescents will be eligible to participate if they meet at least
      3 criteria for borderline personality disorder, with one of those criteria being either
      impulsive behavior or recurrent self-harm behavior. Participants will be assessed at
      baseline, three-months (mid-treatment), six-months (post-treatment, and three-month
      follow-up.

    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>WSAS items are rated on a scale of 0 (No Impairment) to 8 (Severe Impairment). Total scores are calculated by adding the scores of all 5 items. The minimum score of the WSAS is 0 and the maximum score of the WSAS is 40. Scores below 10 are associated with subclinical populations. Scores between 10 and 20 are associated with significant impairment, but less severe clinical symptomology. Scores above 20 are associated with moderately severe or worse psychopathology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The DERS is a 36-item measure of the six facets of emotion regulation.
DERS items are rated on a scale of 1 (Almost Never 0-10%) to 5 (Almost Always 91-100%). The DERS total score ranges from 36-180. The total score is the sum of all subscales. Higher scores suggest greater problems with emotion regulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23)</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSL is a 23-item measure that assesses specific symptoms of borderline personality disorder.
BSL items are measured on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very strong). The sum of all 23 items serves as the global scale factor. The global factor minimum score of the BSL is 0 and the maximum score is 92. To generate scores that are comparable to the original BSL-95, the mean score must be calculated. Higher total scores are associated with more symptoms of borderline personality disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSI is a 53-item measure of psychological distress and psychological symptoms.
BSI items are rated on a scale from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (Extremely). The BSI consists of 9 symptom dimensions and 3 global indices of stress. All 9 dimensions (Somatization, Obsession-Compulsion, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic Anxiety, Paranoid Ideation, and Psychoticism) have a score range from 0-5. Dimension scores are calculated by summing the values for the items included in that dimension and dividing by the number of items endorsed in that dimension.
The 3 global indices of stress are Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Total, and Positive Symptom Distress Index.</description>

    <description>The standard treatment to be delivered to all participants is DBT-A, which is a treatment model adapted from DBT. DBT-A is an adaptation for adolescents with emotion dysregulation and BPD features (Miller, Rathus, &amp; Linehan, 2007; Rathus &amp; Miller, 2015). DBT-A involves weekly individual therapy with the adolescent, weekly multifamily skills group in which adolescents and family members participate, as needed phone coaching, and weekly consultation team for the therapists.</description>
