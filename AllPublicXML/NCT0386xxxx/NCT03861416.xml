  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the
      safety and efficacy of the drug Unifuzol® (L-arginine) in patients with obliterating
      atherosclerosis of the lower extremities. The study recruits patients 40-79 years old with a
      confirmed diagnosis of chronic ischemia of the lower limb and a stable symptom of
      intermittent claudication that occurs when walking a distance of 100-299 meters. L-arginine
      improves microcirculation due to activation of nitrogen monoxide production and stimulates
      capillary blood flow, thus can probably improve the quality of life of patients with
      intermittent claudication. The criterion for treatment efficacy will be an increase in the
      maximum walking distance measures before and on the next day after the end of treatment
      course.
