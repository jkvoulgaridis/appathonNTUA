    <intervention_model_description>Study will be conducted following a staggered design overseen by Internal Safety Review Committee (iSCR):
Step A (low dose of each vaccine): Approximately 15 patients will be randomized (1:1:1). Fourteen days after the 2nd vaccination, iSRC will review all available safety data (of at least 12 patients if approved by local authorities). If considered appropriate to continue, Step B will start.
Step B (prime-boost with ChAd155-hIi-HBV and Modified Vaccinia Ankara HBV vaccine (MVA-HBV) and sequential administration with HBc-HBs/AS01B-4): Approximately 40 patients will first be randomized (2:1:1) for vaccination. Fourteen days after the 2nd vaccination, iSRC will review all available safety data. If considered appropriate to continue, approximately 36 additional patients will be randomized for vaccination.
Step C (prime-boost with ChAd155-hIi-HBV and MVA-HBV and co-administration with HBc-HBs/AS01B-4): Step C randomization (2:1) will start post completion of Step B enrolment.</intervention_model_description>
