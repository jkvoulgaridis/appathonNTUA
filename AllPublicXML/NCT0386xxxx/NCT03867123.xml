      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 2-OHOA added to
      first-line treatment for subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), and to determine
      the highest safe dose of 2-OHOA administered orally when added to the concurrent phase of
      treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) or when added to the maintenance
      phase of treatment with TMZ (once TMZ 200 g/m2/day is started).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IB, open-label, dose-finding study. A de-escalation process has been selected
      for the study with a 3+3 design to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).

      The first group of 3 subjects (within each arm), where all 3 subjects may be started at the
      same time, will receive 2-OHOA at the starting dose of 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 0-1
      Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the first 3 patients, then a new cohort with 3 more
      patients is started at 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 2 or more patients out of 3 or 6 patients
      experience DLT(s) the dose is deescalated.

      De-escalation doses are from 12 g/day (4 g tid) to 8 g/day (4 g bid) and from 8 g/day (4 g
      bid) to 4 g/day (4 g od). This procedure must be applied to the two arms of the study
      described below. Both arms will be independent, and will run in parallel, therefore none of
      the patients from Arm 1 may enter Arm 2.

    <description>Radiotherapy (RT) + temozolomide (TMZ) + 2-OHOA (during Concurrent phase - duration 6 weeks)*:
2-OHOA will be initiated at the start of the concurrent phase and will be administered on a continuous daily basis together with TMZ and RT for 6 weeks at the selected dose, either 12 g/day (4 g tid), 8 g/day (4 g bid) or 4 g/day (4 g od).
RT will be administered only during the concurrent phase, consisting of fractionated focal irradiation administered using 1.8- 2 Gy/fraction, daily for 5 days/week for 6 weeks, for a total dose of up to 60 Gy.
TMZ will be administered during the concurrent phase at a starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day given daily for 6 weeks.
* One extra week may be allowed.</description>

    <description>TMZ + 2-OHOA (during Maintenance phase with TMZ 200 mg/m2/day at Cycle 2 - duration 8 weeks):
2-OHOA will be initiated on day 2 of Cycle 2 of the maintenance phase, when TMZ 200 mg/m2/day is given and administered on a continuous basis for two 28-day cycles. 2-OHOA will be administered at the selected dose, either 12 g/day (4 g tid), 8 g/day (4 g bid) or 4 g/day (4 g od).
TMZ will be administered at 200 mg/m2/day given daily the first 5 days for two 28-day cycles (if no toxicity is seen). In case of toxicity, TMZ dose may be reduced to 150 mg/m2/day at Cycle 3 to allow for recovery.
Both arms will be followed by a 4-week safety follow-up</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Glioblastoma (GBM) according to 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification.

          2. Must have had a partial or complete surgical resection of the Grade 4 astrocytic
             tumor.

          3. Subjects in Arm 1 must have had no previous treatment except surgery (ie, no previous
             RT, local CT, or systemic therapy). Subjects must meet certain other eligibility
             requirements.

          4. Subjects in Arm 2 must have completed a standard first line regimen of concurrent TMZ
             and RT for newly diagnosed GBM patients, followed by a rest phase, and have not had
             any other previous CT except surgery (including any other regimens of RT and local or
             systemic CT). Progression and/or pseudoprogression should have been ruled out before
             starting Arm 2 as per usual clinical practice, with correct laboratory results
             (absolute neutrophile count ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L,
             non-haematological toxicity grade ≤ 2) at screening. Subjects must meet certain other
             eligibility requirements.

          5. Subjects must be able to undergo serial MRIs (computerized tomography may not be a
             substitute for magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]).

          6. Male or female ≥ 18 years old.

          7. Must have a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70% and the ability to swallow oral
             medication.

          8. Must have no other diagnosis of cancer malignancy (except surgically excised
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or treated early stage
             prostate cancer, or a malignancy diagnosed ≥ 5 years previously with no current
             evidence of disease and no therapy within two years prior to enrolment on this study).

          9. Must be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements.

         10. Contraception: All female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential
             unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrhea, in the
             appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause), or have been
             sterilized surgically. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use two
             forms of highly effective contraception methods (a primary and a secondary method)
             during the study and for a period of 6 months following the last administration of the
             study drug. Male patients and their female partners, who are of childbearing potential
             and are not practicing total abstinence, must agree to use two forms of highly
             effective contraception methods (a primary and a secondary method) during the study
             and for a period of 6 months following the last administration of the study drug These
             contraception methods include oral, transdermal, systemic or implant contraception
             birth control, intra-uterine devices (IUD), abstinence and double barrier method such
             as diaphragm with spermicidal gel or other recommended double barrier methods
             screening.

         11. Written informed consent form signed before any study test or procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has received prior systemic CT or RT (Arm 1) or prior systemic CT other than
             TMZ (Arm 2), biologic agents, or any other type of investigational agent for the
             treatment of brain tumors.

          2. Subjects who have progressed on TMZ are not eligible (pseudoprogression ruled out as
             per usual clinical practice).

          3. Subject has evidence of acute intracranial or intratumoral hemorrhage &gt; Grade 1 by
             MRI. Subjects with resolving hemorrhage changes, punctate hemorrhage, or hemosiderin
             may enter the study.

          4. Subject has serious intercurrent illness such as: hypertension despite optimal
             treatment, or significant cardiac arrhythmias; or a recent history of serious disease
             such as symptomatic congestive heart failure, or abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal
             (GI) perforation within 6 months, prior to starting study treatment.

          5. Subject has had major surgery within 28 days prior to starting study treatment (except
             cancer resection surgery in arm 1), or had non water-tight dural closure during
             previous surgery, or has unhealed wounds from previous surgery.

          6. Subject has inherited bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy with the risk of bleeding.

          7. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          8. Subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (a test for
             HIV at screening is not required).

          9. Subject has a previously-identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of
             either the 2-OHOA or TMZ formulations.

         10. Subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator or designee.
