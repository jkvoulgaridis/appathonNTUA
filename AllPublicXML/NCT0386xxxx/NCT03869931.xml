  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts
      for nearly half of all new patients starting dialysis in Singapore, the country with the
      highest rates of DN in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite the scale of the problem, little
      progress has been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disorder and no new
      therapies have been offered.

      The investigators have conducted a metabolomics study of human diabetic nephropathy that
      revealed evidence for alterations in mitochondrial fuel metabolism in patients with the
      disease, a finding also reported in other recent studies of human DN. Based on this finding
      the investigators believe that dysregulated mitochondrial fuel oxidation is a major driver of
      diabetic nephropathy.

      Fenofibrate is an agonist of peroxisome-proliferator activating receptor (ppar)-alpha that is
      approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridemia alone or
      combined in patients unresponsive to dietary and other non-drug therapeutic measures.
      Fenofibrate is also indicated for the reduction in the progression of diabetic retinopathy in
      patients with type 2 diabetes and existing diabetic retinopathy. Presently fenofibrate is not
      indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with fenofibrate, taken orally at 300mg per day
      or 100mg per day for 30 days will lead to significant changes in the circulating metabolomics
      patterns in patients with DN. The investigators propose to administer the drug for a period
      of 30 days and will perform a comprehensive analysis of the state of fuel metabolism in these
      patients before, and after the administration of fenofibrate using targeted metabolomics and
      other approaches. Fundal photography, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Optical
      Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) will also be performed at baseline and
      post-treatment. A total of 300 subjects will be recruited from Singapore General Hospital
      (SGH) Diabetes and Metabolic Centre. Our goal is to discover key changes in fuel metabolism
      in DN patients receiving fenofibrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-centre, open label study, 300 adults with DN will be recruited over 3 years.
      Following screening and baseline metabolic evaluations, eligible subjects will be treated
      with fenofibrate for 30-days and re-assessed.

      4.1 Study Visits and Procedures Subjects will have their written informed consent taken
      during Visit 1 at the SGH Clinical Trials Research Centre (CTRC) and undergo screening and
      baseline assessments. Eligible subjects will return within the next 14 days for the
      initiation of study drug (Visit 2). The post-treatment and final visit (Visit 3) will take
      place 30 ± 7 days after Visit 2. Details of study visits are described in Table 1 (Refer
      study protocol).

      4.1.1 VISIT 1: Informed Consent and Screening Interested patients will be scheduled for their
      first study visit (Visit 1) at SGH CTRC. Written informed consent will be taken by the
      principal or co-investigators assigned by the PI. After consent has been taken, study
      procedures in Table 1 will be performed. The PI or Co-Is assigned by the PI, will review
      screening results to determine whether subjects are eligible to continue with the study.

      4.1.2 VISIT 2: Initiation of Study Drug

      Subjects who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will return to the CTRC within the
      next 14 days to receive the study drug, fenofibrate. Fenofibrate is to be taken orally for 30
      days. The dose of fenofibrate will be adjusted based on the estimated CrCl during Visit 1 as
      below.

      CrCl (ml/min) Fenofibrate Dosage &gt; 60 300mg/day 30-59 100 mg/day &lt; 30 Contraindicated

      Subjects will take the first dose of fenofibrate under supervision of the clinical research
      coordinator at SGH CTRC. They will be given a drug diary to record their intake.

      Before the initiation of the study drug, subjects will first head over to Singapore Eye
      Research Institution (SERI) or Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC)) for eye tests as
      mentioned in the following paragraphs.

      Fundus Photography, conventional OCT and Assessment and grading of DR The presence and
      severity of DR or DME will be assessed from digital fundus photographs and OCT. Following
      pupillary dilation, 7-field ETDRS photography using a non-mydriatic 45º fundus cameras will
      be obtained for each eye. The modified Wisconsin protocol will be used for DR grading. DR
      will be considered present if any characteristic lesion as defined by the ETDRS severity
      scale is present: microaneurysms (MA), hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, intraretinal
      microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), hard exudates (HE), venous beading, and new vessels. For
      each eye, a retinopathy severity score will be assigned according to a scale modified from
      the Airlie House classification system. Macular edema is defined by hard exudates in the
      presence of MA and blot hemorrhage within 1 disc diameter from the foveal center or presence
      of focal photocoagulation scars in the macular area. Clinically significant macular edema
      (CSME) is considered present when the macular edema involved is within 500 mm of the foveal
      center or if focal photocoagulation scars are present in the macular area. DR is categorized
      as minimal non-proliferative DR (level 20), mild non-proliferative DR (level 35), moderate
      non-proliferative DR (level 43 through 47), severe NPDR (level 53), and proliferative
      retinopathy (&gt;60). Vision-threatening retinopathy is defined as the presence of severe NPDR,
      PDR, or CSME. Presence of DME (centre involving and non centre involving) and central retinal
      thickness will also be assessed on OCT

      Ultrawide field imaging Stereoscopic 200-degree-field ultrawide field images of each subject
      will be obtained using the Optos P200MA instrument. Unlike traditional fundus cameras, Optos
      imaging relies on proper eye positioning by the imager and correct patient fixation on a
      target, rather than the imager viewing the retinal structures for focus. The UWF200 images
      are centered on the fovea, covering approximately 25% and 82%, respectively, of the retinal
      area, including the optic disc, macula, and major vascular arcades. Grading of UWF imaging
      will be performed using the ETDRS protocol to determine the presence and severity of the
      following lesions: hemorrhages, microaneurysms, or both (H/Ma); intraretinal microvascular
      abnormalities (IRMA); venous beading (VB); cotton wool spots; hard exudates; retinal
      thickening; new vessels on the disc; new vessels elsewhere (NVE) on the retina; preretinal
      hemorrhage; vitreous hemorrhage; and traction retinal detachment. This test will be optional.

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA)
      Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography and optical coherence tomographic angiography
      will be performed in both eyes to obtain scans of the macular, macular thickness, retinal
      nerve fiber thickness optic disc, and optic nerve head.

      4.1.3 VISIT 3: 4-Week Post-Treatment Visit

      Visit 3 will take place 30 ± 7 days from Visit 2. Subjects who are still on the study drug
      should continue take the study drug on the morning of Visit 3 with plain water. Subjects will
      be assessed to quantify changes in metabolic fuel utilization after treatment with
      fenofibrate. These changes are determined based on metabolomic profiling of acyl-carnitines,
      organic acids and amino acid, indirect calorimetry measurements and the eye tests. The list
      of procedures performed is listed in Table 1.

      SAMPLE COLLECTION

      Up to a total of 47 ml (~3.2 tablespoons) of blood and 90 ml (~6.0 tablespoons) of urine will
      be collected for the entire study. During Visit 1 (Screening), approximately 25 ml (~1.7
      tablespoons) of blood and 30 ml (~2.0 tablespoon) of urine will be collected. During Visit 2
      (Dosing visit), 30 ml of urine will be collected and during Visit 3 (post-treatment &amp; final
      visit), approximately 22ml (~1.5 tablespoon) of blood and 30 ml (~2.0 tablespoon) of urine
      will be collected.

      Subjects who developed drug-related adverse reactions may require additional blood and urine
      taken for clinical assessment.

      LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS

      A) Blood Chemistry Screening and standard laboratory tests including full blood count,
      Potassium, Creatinine. alanine transaminase, aspartame transamniase, β-human chorionic
      gonadotropin, CK, lipid panel, glucose and HbA1c will be measured in the clinical laboratory
      using standard methods.

      B) Metabolomic Profiling Metabolomic profiling of lipids, acylcarnitines (ACs), organic acids
      and ketones will be measured using liquid and gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS/MS and Gas Chromatography-MS/MS) at the Duke-National University of Singapore
      metabolomics laboratory.

      ACs represent intermediaries of metabolic fuel oxidation and provides a &quot;snap-shot&quot; of in
      vivo metabolism at the cellular level. The measurement of the various long-,
      intermediate-chain ACs provide an indicator of fatty acid oxidation efficiency. Ceramides are
      toxic lipid intermediaries that are implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.
      Lactate, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate are organic
      acids involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. Beta hydroxybutyrate is a ketone which
      will also be measured with the organic acids.

      C) Urine Protein Excretion

      Urine ACR and PCR will be performed to quantify urine protein excretion.
