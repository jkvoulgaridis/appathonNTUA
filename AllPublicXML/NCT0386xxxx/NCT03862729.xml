  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: the first part is to conduct a multicenter retrospective
      analysis of more than 1000 acute ICH patients treated by conservative observation from 33
      centers in China to create a predictive model of intracerebral hemorrhage growth based on
      clinical, blood, genetic, imaging, and pharmacological factors; the second part is to
      validate the efficacy of the minimally invasive surgery, including stereotactic thrombolysis
      and endoscopic surgery, in 300 eligible patients with high risk of hemorrhage growth
      according to the first part results in a prospective multicenter cohort study.

    <textblock>
      Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 2 million strokes worldwide per year
      and is the deadliest subtype of stroke with a 1-year mortality rate up to 50%. Given the high
      morbidity and mortality of this disease process, surgical options have been repeatedly
      evaluated in large multicenter randomized controlled trials that unfortunately have not
      demonstrated improved outcomes. Time to treatment is a factor that has been shown to carry
      enormous weight in the treatment of ischemic stroke but has not yet been demonstrated to play
      a role in hemorrhagic stroke. On the other hand, Intracerebral hemorrhage growth in
      early-stage is associated with the poor clinical outcome. Thus, investigators assume that
      minimally invasive surgery in early-stage ICH patients with high risk of hemorrhage growth
      may improve the long-term outcomes. In the first part, the investigators will review more
      than 1000 early-stage ICH patients from 33 centers within the last 5 years in China to create
      a predictive model of intracerebral hemorrhage growth based on clinical, blood, genetic,
      imaging, and pharmacological factors. The &quot;early-stage&quot; means 24 hours from symptom onset to
      baseline imaging. The &quot;hemorrhage growth&quot; is defined as an increase in intracerebral
      hemorrhage volume between baseline and repeat imaging of more than 6 mL or more than 33%. The
      second part is to validate the efficacy of the minimally invasive surgery in patients with
      high risk of hemorrhage growth according to the first part results in a prospective
      multicenter cohort study. Endoscopic surgery and stereotactic thrombolysis (150 patients)
      will be compared with conventional treatment (150 patients), including medical treatment and
      conventional craniotomy. Clinical data and laboratory data will be collected by electric case
      report form (CRF) and uploaded online by each neurosurgery center to form the prospective
      clinical database in First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. This cohort
      follow-up study will be across a 3-year period with a 2 years interval of enrollment and 1
      year follow up for each patient.

        In the retrospective part, at least 1000 conservatively treated acute ICH patients during
        the last 5 years from 31 Grade Ⅲ A level hospitals and 2 Grade Ⅱ A level hospitals
        distributed all over China will be enrolled. Patients should have undergone baseline CT
        scan within 24 hours after hemorrhage onset and repeated fewer than 48 hours. In the
        prospective part, at least 300 cute ICH patients with high risk of hemorrhage growth,
        according to the results of first part, from the same hospitals will be enrolled. All
        patients in this study should meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed written
        consent should be obtained from eligible adult patients or from the guardians of eligible
        pediatric patients. All patients in the prospective part of this study can withdraw at any
        time.

        1. Retrospective part

             Inclusion Criteria:

               -  Emergent CT showed a spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (patient
                  with a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is eligible);

               -  Patients should have undergone baseline CT scan within 24 hours after hemorrhage
                  onset and repeated fewer than 48 hours;

               -  Patients without herniation.

               -  Patients were treated by observation before hemorrhage growth (if happened).

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to an underlying structural cause
                  identified by brain imaging, (ie, vascular malformation, aneurysm, tumor);

               -  The time from symptom onset to baseline imaging was not known in hours, clinical
                  information or lab results was not enough to determine the growth of the hematoma
                  or to perform statistical analysis;

               -  Patients had accepted acute treatment that might have reduced intracerebral
                  hemorrhage volume (ie, surgical evacuation, external ventricular drainage, lumbar
                  puncture).

          2. Prospective part

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergent CT showed a spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (patient with
             a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is eligible);

          -  Patients without herniation meet the clinical uncertainty principle as follows: the
             responsible neurosurgeon is uncertain about the benefits of surgery.

          -  Patients should have undergone baseline CT scan within 24 hours after hemorrhage
             onset; the volume of the hematoma is more than 20 ml and less than 100ml on the first
             CT scan.

          -  Patients with a Glasgow coma score of 5 or more.

          -  Informed consent, and willing to accept long-term follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to an underlying structural cause
             identified by brain imaging, (ie, vascular malformation, aneurysm, tumor);

          -  patients had a cerebellar hemorrhage or extension of a supratentorial hemorrhage into
             the brainstem;

          -  patients had severe pre-existing physical or mental disability or severe comorbidity
             that might interfere with the assessment of outcome.

          -  Severe coagulopathy, INR cannot be reversed to less than or equal to 1.5

          -  Patients during pregnancy or lactation.
