  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to undertake a randomized, controlled trial which will generate
      Level 1 evidence concerning optimal fixation methods for the treatment of severe open tibia
      fractures in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The investigators hope to determine the optimal
      management of severe open tibial fractures in Sub-Saharan Africa in order to reduce long-term
      disability, limit the economic impact of injury, and avoid resource costs of reoperation. The
      investigators plan to compare the all-cause reoperation rate for AO/Orthopaedic Trauma
      Association (OTA) Type 42 open tibial shaft fractures treated with initial intramedullary
      nailing versus external fixation at Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute in Dar es Salaam,
      Tanzania, to compare rates of secondary clinical endpoints including postoperative
      superficial and deep infection, clinical union, radiographic union, malunion, and
      health-related quality of life with minimum one year follow-up, and identify prognostic
      factors related to the patient, injury, or management protocol that impact the reoperation
      rate, return to work, and health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective randomised controlled trial at a tertiary referral
      hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania from December 17th, 2015 to March 25th, 2017. All open
      tibia fractures arriving at the hospital emergency room during the enrollment period were
      screened for inclusion in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are noted later in this
      submission.All patients who were eligible after clinical screening were offered enrollment in
      the study and subsequently completed written informed consent in either English or Swahili
      depending on the patient's preference. The investigation was approved by ethical review
      boards at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and the Tanzanian National
      Institute for Medical Research (NIMR).

      All enrolled participants were taken to the operating room for initial irrigation and
      debridement using a standardized protocol aiming for debridement within 24 hours of hospital
      admission. Preoperative ceftriaxone was given as soon as possible after presentation to the
      emergency department. Following debridement, the primary surgeon determined if the wound was
      amenable to immediate or delayed primary closure. If amenable to primary closure, the patient
      was randomized by a site research coordinator to one of two treatments (Intramedullary
      nailing (IMN) or external fixation (EF))using a centralized web-based electronic
      randomization tool, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The study computer analyst
      developed the REDCap randomization module with input from senior authors. The REDCap
      randomization module incorporated block randomization to maintain equal patient distribution
      between each treatment group and to ensure allocation concealment.

      Data from a pilot study at the site of our investigation informed sample size calculations,
      which showed reoperation rates of external fixation and intramedullary nailing of 38% versus
      3.8%. However, with longer follow-up and more stringent criteria for a primary event, The
      investigators used a more conservative effect size of 20% compared to 5%. Using a power of
      80% and alpha of 0.05, The investigators calculated the study would require 88 patients in
      each treatment group (176 total). Accounting for 20% loss to follow up, The investigators
      estimated a total sample size requirement of 240 patients (120 per group).

      Data monitoring was completed by the adjudication committee at 6 month intervals throughout
      the study duration and prior to final analysis in December, 2018.

Smile component is categorized into painful grimace (1), neutral expression (2), and smile (3) where painful grimace is worst and smile is best.
-Values are scored from 1 to 3 where 1 is worst and 3 is best

Patients receive definitive fixation of AO/OTA-42 open tibia diaphyseal fractures using the standard SIGN nail (SIGN Fracture Care International, Richland, WA). The number of interlocking screws is at the discretion of the treating surgeon, who also has the option to use an external fixator for damage control, and later conversion to IMN when clinically appropriate. The experimental group procedure is less common in the study setting, and thus, viewed as the experimental group.</description>
