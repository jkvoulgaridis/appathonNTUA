  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will develop and test the feasibility of the Lung Cancer Assessment of Risk and
      Education (LungCARE) intervention to increase discussions about lung cancer screening between
      patients and physicians. This intervention will be designed to reach primary care patients
      and will be implemented at three levels of the healthcare structure: patient, physician, and
      system. The patient component includes a short lung cancer screening video and questions
      regarding screening preferences. Patients will receive immediate feedback in a report
      (patient report) that summarizes their lung cancer screening preferences and a handout
      summarizing the educational video. At the physician level, primary care physicians (PCPs)
      will receive a similar report (physician report), which will be delivered to them prior to
      the patient visit. The report contains additional information about documenting discussion
      related to risk, screening, and referrals in the electronic health record (EHR) system
      (system component). The investigators will develop the LungCARE intervention and have a
      comparison group that will receive usual care. Preliminary testing of LungCARE will occur via
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the University of California, San Francisco, General
      Internal Medicine and Women's Health Primary Care clinics. The RCT will evaluate LungCARE
      among 50 PCPs and 120 high-risk current and former smoker patients. The investigators will
      determine whether the intervention is accepted by patients and physicians and whether
      patients who received LungCARE are more likely to discuss lung cancer screening with their
      physicians when compared to patients and physicians in the comparison group. The
      investigators will also determine whether the intervention affects knowledge of lung cancer
      and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, perception of risk, and worry about lung
      cancer in patients when compared to patients in the comparison group. The investigators
      expect their research to provide specific recommendations that will facilitate
      patient-physician discussions about LDCT screening and promote shared decision-making among
      patients and physicians.

    <measure>Discussion of lung cancer risk and LDCT screening with PCP</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 1 will be assessed in the follow-up survey, administered within one week following the clinic visit. All patients will answer the following yes/no questions: &quot;During your PCP visit, did you discuss...your personal risk of getting lung cancer/the risks and benefits of screening/how often people should be screened/whether you should be screened?&quot;, &quot;Did you discuss smoking cigarettes?&quot;, &quot;Did you talk about smoking and the risk of lung cancer?&quot;, and &quot;Did your doctor refer you to or order a test for lung cancer screening?&quot; Each question will be looked at individually and summed into a single score (0-7). Higher scores indicate an increased discussion of lung cancer risk and LDCT screening.
Three months following the clinic visit, the investigators will review the electronic health records for all patients who signed HIPAA forms. Investigators will gather information about discussion of lung cancer risk and documentation, referrals, counseling, and receipt of LDCT screening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of lung cancer screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Over one week</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 2 will be assessed in the follow-up survey, administered within one week following the clinic visit. All patients will answer true/false questions addressing various screening topics (e.g. annual lung cancer screening, false negative scans, false positive scans, who should be screened, and radiation exposure). Correct answers will be given a score of 1 and incorrect answers will be given a score of 0. Responses for each question will be added up to a single score, ranging between 0 and 10. Lower scores indicate lower knowledge and higher scores indicate higher knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of lung cancer risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Over one week</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 3 will be measured using an adapted Lerman Cancer Worry Scale. The following question will be asked over the course of one week, both prior to and following the clinic visit: &quot;In your opinion, compared to most people of your same age, sex, and race, what are you chances of getting lung cancer someday?&quot; Participants will use a five-point Likert scale (&quot;much higher&quot; [1], &quot;higher&quot; [2], &quot;about the same&quot; [3], &quot;lower&quot; [4], &quot;much lower&quot; [5]) to answer the questions. A higher score indicates a lower perception of lung cancer risk. Responses will be compared between the baseline and follow-up surveys.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Worry about lung cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Over one week</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome 4 will be measured using an adapted Lerman Cancer Worry Scale. The following questions will be asked over the course of one week, both prior to and following the clinic visit: &quot;How worried are you about getting lung cancer someday?&quot;, &quot;During the past month, how much has your worry about lung cancer affected your mood?&quot;, &quot;During the past month, how much has your worry about lung cancer affected your ability to perform your daily activities?&quot;, and &quot;During the past month, how often have you thought about your chances of getting lung cancer?&quot; Patients will use a 5-point Likert scale (&quot;a lot&quot; [1], &quot;somewhat&quot; [2], &quot;a little&quot; [3], &quot;not at all&quot; [4]) to answer the first 3 questions and a 4-point Likert scale (&quot;almost all the time&quot; [1], &quot;often&quot; [2], &quot;sometimes&quot; [3], &quot;not at all or rarely&quot; [4]) to answer the last question. Higher scores indicate a lower perception of risk. Each question will be examined individually. Responses will be compared between the baseline and follow-up surveys.</description>

    <description>The LungCARE intervention involves patient and PCP components. The patient component consists of watching a short, educational video, answering questions about lung cancer screening preferences, and receiving a patient report and handout.
The PCP component consists of receiving a similar report (physician report) prior to the patient visit. This report is based on the patient's risk factors and lung cancer screening preferences. It contains additional information about documenting discussions related to risk, screening, and referrals in the electronic medical record system.</description>
