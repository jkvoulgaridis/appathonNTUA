  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Endocrine disorders involve changes to glands that produce hormones. Hormones are released by
      these glands into the blood so they can direct the function of other tissues in the body.
      Researchers want to study people who may have endocrine disorders. They want to learn more
      about the conditions that affect endocrine glands.

      Objective:

      To study adults with a variety of endocrine disorders for research and physician education.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older who have an endocrine or metabolic-related disorder

      Healthy volunteers 18 and older

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

      Participants will have a physical exam and medical history.

      The length of the study and the schedule will vary by participant. Tests may include:

      Blood and urine tests

      Stool and saliva samples

      Imaging studies: Participants will lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of the body.
      They may be injected with a substance to make their organs more visible in the pictures.

      Tests of endocrine tissue function

      Consultation with other specialists

      Sleep study

      Medical photographs

      Participants may be treated for their endocrine disorder. This could include:

      Surgery. If tissue is removed during surgery, it may be studied.

      Radiation

      Medicine

      Participants may have genetic testing. This will be done with a small amount of blood, cells
      from a cheek swab, or saliva.

      This protocol is designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of adults with a
      variety of endocrine disorders for purposes of research and physician education in our
      accredited internal medicine endocrinology training programs. Participants will receive
      clinical care per standard of practice for their condition. Data collected from standard
      clinical practice will be retained for future research. The research-directed evaluations may
      include collection and retention for future use of blood, feces, saliva, or urine samples or
      evaluation of tissue that was routinely collected for clinical care. In some patients with
      endocrine disorders, laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm a
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient, using standard approaches in current
      clinical practice. In some cases, the patient will receive medical, radiation or surgical
      treatment for their disorder.

        any adult with a potential endocrine disorder; the types of disorders may vary to ensure

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age 18 years or greater.

          -  The possible disorder of the patient subjects must complement the case-mix in the
             IETP, as determined by the Principal Investigator. A log will be used to assure that
             the training needs of the teaching protocols are being met.

        EXCLUSION CRITIERIA:

          1. Unstable patients and patients with severe organ failure, or those with a condition or
             medical treatment that may affect/limit the endocrine work-up and exhaust Clinical
             Center, NIDDK and/or NICHD resources will be excluded if appropriate. Decisions will
             be made on a case by case basis by the investigators. For example, there is a weight
             limit for the interventional radiology table used for venous

             sampling.

          2. Inability of a subject to adhere to a proposed schedule of visits.

          3. Individuals must be able to provide informed consent.
