  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 different application
      rates of topically applied Crisaborole ointment 2% over vehicle in adults with mild to
      moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). In each subject four application areas will be identified.
      Each subject will receive 4 treatments: the 3 different application rates of the active
      treatment and the vehicle. The areas will be randomly assigned to treatment with topical
      Crisaborole ointment 2% and vehicle, once daily, for 2 weeks, without occlusion.

    <description>Change from baseline in TSS in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle at Day 15.
Total Signs Score (TSS) of the lesion is the assessment of the severity of erythema, edema/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification. Each of these subscales is scored independently using the 4-point severity scale with a value range from 0 to 3; 0 is the minimum (best) and 3 is the maximum (worst). The total score is computed by the sum of each subscale where the total ranges from the minimum 0 (best) to the maximum 12 (worst).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of active atopic dermatitis (AD) with at least 6 month history
             prior to screening and that has been clinically stable for 1 month.

          -  Has four application areas of 3 cm in diameter with a TSS of ≥5 and TAA of moderate at
             Day 1. The application areas must not be located on the face, scalp, axillae, groin,
             genitals, hands, and feet. The application areas should be ≥1 cm apart.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a female who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or who is planning to become
             pregnant during the study.

          -  Subject has clinically infected AD.

          -  Subject has a Fitzpatrick's Skin Phototype ≥5.

          -  Subject is known to have immune deficiency or is immunocompromised.

          -  Subject has a history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within 5 years prior to
             Day 1. Subjects with successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or
             basal cell carcinoma and/or successfully treated localized carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix are not to be excluded.

          -  Subject had a major surgery within 8 weeks prior to Day 1 or has a major surgery
             planned during the study.

          -  Subject has any clinically significant medical condition that would, in the opinion of
             the investigator, put the subject at undue risk or interfere with interpretation of
             study results.

          -  Subject has a known history of chronic infectious disease (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis
             C, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus).

          -  Subject with a known lack of efficacy to crisaborole.

          -  Subject has a known or suspected allergy to crisaborole, including any non-medicinal
             ingredient, or component of the container.

          -  Subject has a known history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse in the
             last year prior to Day 1.
