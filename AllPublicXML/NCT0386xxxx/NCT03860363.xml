  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Thoraguard Surgical Drainage System in a
      real-world clinical environment. It is believed that this system will offer functional and
      clinical benefits over the current standard of care system for the removal of surgical fluids
      following cardiac surgery. Observations, experiences, and outcomes in a single hospital
      setting will be collected for the Thoraguard Surgical Drainage System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Thoraguard System is intended for use for drainage of blood, fluids, and gases following
      cardiac and thoracic surgery. The system consists of an electronic control module, drainage
      kit (fluid collection canister and drainage line), and chest tube kit with novel chest tube.
      The system continuously monitors chest tube and drainage line patency, automatically clears
      the chest tube and drainage line from build-up, and provides digital readings of fluid output
      trends. Additionally, the system has patient safety alarms to notify clinical staff of an
      unexpected event associated with post-operative drainage. These functions offer significant
      improvements over current standard of care. Reliable post-operative drainage, reduced
      workload, and decreased variability in chest tube maintenance procedures have the potential
      to increase patient safety, reduce complications, and improve patient experience.

    <description>The Device User Experience Survey is an unvalidated, Sponsor-generated questionnaire aimed to increase the Sponsor's understanding of the usability of the Thoraguard Surgical Drainage System. The questionnaire asks approximately 15 questions (includes yes/no responses, rating scales, and fill-in-the-blank sections) and is to be completed by the treating clinicians at the completion of the study. A summary of all treating clinician responses will be generated at the completion of the study to summarize the overall user experience with the device.</description>
