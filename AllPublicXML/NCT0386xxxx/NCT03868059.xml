      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm study evaluating the blood pressure (BP)
      changes from baseline (Visit 3) to post-treatment (Visit 5) assessed by ambulatory blood

      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm study evaluating the blood pressure (BP)
      changes from baseline (Visit 3) to post-treatment (Visit 5) assessed by ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring (ABPM) in LPCN 1021 treated adult hypogonadal male subjects.

      The study is comprised of six scheduled visits: Visit 1 and 2 are for screening, Visit 3 is
      to assess subject's baseline BP and pulse rate (PR) via ABPM. Visit 4 is to enroll subjects,
      and to provide subjects with study medication for the start of dosing. Visit 5 is to assess
      subject's post-treatment BP and PR via ABPM. Visit 6 is to perform exit visit procedures.

             if required.

          5. Na√Øve to androgen replacement or has discontinued current treatment and completed
             adequate washout of prior androgen therapy. Washout must be completed prior to
             collection of baseline serum T samples to determine study eligibility.
