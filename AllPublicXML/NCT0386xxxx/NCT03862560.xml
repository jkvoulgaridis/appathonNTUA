  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, soccer has grown increasingly popular among female players. According to the
      Women´s Football Survey of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
      there were more than 30 million registered women soccer players in 2014. Elite female soccer
      players cover approximately a total distance of 10 km with 1.7 km completed at high-speed
      (&gt;18 km/h-1), between 1350 and 1650 changes of activity like passing, dribbling, tackling and
      trapping and 5.1 and 31.2 repeated sprinting and high intensity bouts, respectively. Thus, it
      seems that those strategies addressed to improve such high-intensity activities should be
      considered a priority for female soccer players.

      Different training methods to improve soccer specific variables have been developed such as,
      high-intensity interval training, resisted sprint training, strength training or plyometric
      training. Whilst individual training interventions have been shown to produce enhancements in
      measures of athletic performance for soccer players, there is a paucity of studies looking at
      the effectiveness of strength and power training specifically on performance measures in
      female soccer populations.

      Unilateral strength asymmetry can be a risk factor of musculoskeletal injuries. In recent
      years, inter-limb asymmetries have been included in battery tests performed by different
      soccer clubs due to their relation with lower-limb injuries. Few studies have analysed the
      change of an intervention on inter-limb asymmetry in female soccer players, hence, more
      studies for this population are warranted.

      The main aim of this research project is therefore, to evaluate the effect of a physical
      intervention on the performance and inter-limb asymmetries of female soccer players.
