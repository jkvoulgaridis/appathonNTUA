      1. Primary Objective:

           Demonstrate that the IC-Flow Imaging device with Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a feasible
           technique when visualizing and identifying perfusion of organs when compared to The KARL
           STORZ VITOM II ICG System during open reconstructive surgical procedures

        2. Secondary Objective:

             1. Evaluate the mean Assessment of handling properties using The IC- Flow versus The
                VITOM II.

             2. Evaluate the mean Surgeon preference Level using The IC- Flow tower, The IC-Flow
                Hand-held device versus The VITOM II.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no literature that supports the clinical application of the IC-Flow.
      However, we intend to perform this pilot study to determine safety and feasibility of said
      device in comparison to its homologue, FDA-approved VITOM II ICG System.

      The device named The KARL STORZ VITOM II ICG System is an imaging system used in capturing
      and viewing fluorescent images. The system is FDA approved for all the indications that are
      going to be used in our study as well as the specialties involved It is composed of an open
      field multidirectional imaging arm and head, a light guide and a video processor/illuminator
      (FDA 510 (k) K171238, May 25, 2017).

      As indicated by the Department of Health and Human Services from the FDA, the indications for
      use are the following: &quot;The system is used in capturing and viewing fluorescence images for
      the visual assessment of blood flow as an adjunctive method for the evaluation of tissue
      perfusion, and related tissue-transfer circulation in tissue and free flaps used in plastic,
      micro- and reconstructive surgical procedures.&quot; And &quot;The system is intended to provide
      fluorescence images for the visual assessment of blood flow in vessels and related tissue
      perfusion during gastrointestinal procedures.&quot; Based on the information provided by the FDA,
      the device has no direct nor indirect effect on patients. Furthermore, the device predicts a
      safe use and it's intended to provide imagery feedback alone.

      There is few clinical trials which broadly exemplify the alternate applications of ICG
      fluorescence as a diagnostic tool for intraoperative anatomical identification, in terms of
      structure, perfusion, and tissue viability. No significant increase of risks or
      dye-associated complications had been reported.

    <description>Only patients who might benefit from intraoperative fluorescent tissue perfusion assessment according to the primary surgeon will be enrolled in the study. The patients will be screened and consent during their office visit with their surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Each surgeon will follow the standard Open surgical protocol of his/her subspecialty, and will comply with the following additional steps according to the type of surgery:</description>

    <intervention_name>Perfusion evaluation with indocyanine green</intervention_name>
    <description>1. At least 10 minutes before surgery, will receive a weight-scaled dose of indocyanine green by IV and the time of administration and any adverse reactions will be recorded. The Surgeon/researcher will visualize and record the images given by the KARL STORZ VITOM II ICG System and the IC-Flow camera.
3. The surgery will proceed as planned pre-operatively. The surgeon will conduct the surgery under white light and will categorize initial visualization of the organs.</description>
