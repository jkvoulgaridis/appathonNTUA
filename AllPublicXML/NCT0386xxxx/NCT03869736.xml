  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the antidepressant
      effects of nitrous oxide in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is a global
      medical condition that causes significant health and economic burden. Recent studies have
      shown that a single dose of ketamine, an NMDA-antagonist, has fast and long lasting
      anti-depressant effect. Nitrous oxide, another NMDA-antagonist, is widely used for anesthesia
      and analgesia, safer to administer and has fewer side effects than ketamine.

      A randomized controlled crossover feasibility study showed significant reduction in
      depressive symptoms at 2 and 24 hours after a single 1-hour treatment session of inhaled
      nitrous oxide compared with placebo. Nitrous oxide is inexpensive and can be safely
      administered by any trained clinician. If found to be efficacious, it could be used to
      provide rapid anti-depressant effect whilst the benefit of traditional anti-depressants has
      its delayed effect. Another potential application could be in acutely suicidal patients.

      This investigated-initiated phase 2b trial will enable confirmation and extension of the
      findings from the feasibility study, and identify the optimal dose and regimen in a broader
      population of those with MDD. Participants will be randomized to receive a weekly 1-hour
      inhalational sessions of either nitrous oxide or placebo (oxygen-air mixture) for 4 weeks,
      and the nitrous group will be further randomly assigned to a dose of 50% nitrous oxide or 25%
      nitrous oxide. Depression severity will be assessed by a blinded observer pre-treatment and
      at weekly intervals during and for 4 weeks after treatment using the Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale.

    <description>21-point Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
Interview-based questionnaire used to measure the severity of depression. Consists of 21 items with a score calculated from the first 17 answers. Higher scores are associated with more severe depression:
0 - 7 = Normal 8 - 13 = Mild Depression 14-18 = Moderate Depression 19 - 22 = Severe Depression &gt; 23 = Very Severe Depression Max score = 52</description>

    <description>Assessed using daily Profile of Mood States scale. The POMS measures six different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time. score range with lower scores indicative of people with more stable mood profiles The Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire is a validated psychological test containing 65 emotions/ mood states. Participants are asked to rank their current mood states using the scale 'not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', 'quite a lot' or 'extremely'. Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score and an analysis of tension, depression, anger, vigour, fatigue and confusion is performed based on the participants mood states. Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) can be calculated by adding the scores for Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue and Confusion and then subtracting the score for Vigour.
• TMD = (Tension + Depression + Anger + Fatigue + Confusion) - Vigour</description>
