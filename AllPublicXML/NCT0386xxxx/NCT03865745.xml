      The purpose of this study is to investigate the positive effects of red ginseng extract on
      intestinal bacterial changes and immunity, free radicals, antioxidant capacity, and autonomic
      nervous system changes in age of 40~75 men and women with climacteric symptoms for 24 weeks.

      A screening test is conducted for those who have agreed in writing with a detailed
      explanation of the purpose of this study and research methods, and then a person who meets
      the selection / exclusion criteria is selected.

      Give a registration number to the person selected as the subject through the screening, and
      take one pack of the product (3g) once a day for 24 weeks in a human body application test.

      Prior to taking the registration number (1Day), the efficacy evaluation items and the safety
      evaluation items are carried out. At the 24 weeks after the starting point of taking the
      product of human application test, the evaluation items are conducted through outpatient
      visits.
