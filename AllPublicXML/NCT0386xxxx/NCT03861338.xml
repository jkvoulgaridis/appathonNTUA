  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 12-week, open-label pilot study of sublocade (extended-release
      burprenorphine, BXR) as treatment for opiate use disorder (OUD) testing positive for Highly
      Potent Synthetic Opioids (HPSO). The investigators plan to enroll 10 participants into the
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, uncontrolled pilot study. Outpatients seeking treatment for Opiate Use
      Disorder (OUD) will be screened, and those eligible who are positive for fentanyl analogues
      at screening will be consented and inducted onto sublingual buprenorphine (target dose 16mg
      to 24mg). On the fourth day after starting the buprenorphine induction, participants will
      receive sublocade (BXR) 300mg by subcutaneious injection. Participants will be seen twice per
      week for urine collection for toxicology and research assessments and will have Medication
      Management counseling weekly during one of these visits. BXR will be administered monthly and
      dosing will be according to the FDA prescribing instructions of 300mg for the second dose and
      100mg for the third.

    <description>The monthly Sublocade buprenorphine extended-release (BXR) injection will be administered in two doses (100 mg and 300 mg). Following a 4 day induction onto oral buprenorphine, the first 300 mg injection of Sublocade will be administered. A second 300 mg Sublocade injection will be administered 1 month later and the third and final monthly injection of 100 mg of Sublocade will be administered 2 months post the successful buprenorphine induction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals between the ages of 18-65

          -  Voluntarily seeking treatment for opioid use

          -  Meets current DSM-5 criteria for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) as a primary diagnosis,
             with at least moderate severity

          -  Test positive for Highly Potent Synthetic Opioids (HPSO) use

          -  Able to provide informed consent and comply with study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorder other than opioid as the primary
             diagnosis

          -  Having a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis that might interfere with participation or
             make participation hazardous, such as an active psychotic disorder or current suicide
             risk

          -  Methadone maintenance treatment

          -  Buprenorphine maintenance treatment

          -  Known history of allergy, intolerance, or hypersensitivity to candidate medication
             (buprenorphine)

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, or failure to use adequate contraceptive methods in female
             patients, male participants are required to use adequate forms of birth control as the
             exposure to Sublocade on sperm and subsequent fetal development are not known.

          -  Unstable medical conditions, which might make participation hazardous such as
             uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;150/100), acute hepatitis, uncontrolled
             diabetes, or elevated liver function tests (AST and ALT &gt;3 times the upper limit of
             normal

          -  Legally mandated to substance use disorder treatment

          -  Current physiological dependence on alcohol or sedative-hypnotics that would require a
             medically supervised detoxification-other substance use diagnoses are not exclusionary

          -  Individuals, who in the clinicians judgment, have a history of failed trial of
             buprenorphine or sublocade (e.g. history of severe opioid intoxication or overdoses
             despite adequate adherence to buprenorphine or sublocade), or other features of the
             history that strongly suggest the patient is not a good candidate for outpatient
             treatment with buprenorphine.
