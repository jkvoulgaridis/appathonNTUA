  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to develop upper limb rehabilitation interventions that
      can be utilized for stroke survivors, specifically survivors with more severe limitations in
      use of their affected upper limb.

      This study will utilize a novel method of non-invasive brain stimulation in conjunction with
      upper limb training given for 15 visits over a period of 5 weeks.

      The study will include the following site visits:

        -  Eligibility Screening and Informed Consent Visit

        -  An MRI visit

        -  Two testing visits in which motor function of the upper limb and neurophysiology will be
           measured

        -  Fifteen intervention visits during which patients will receive upper limb training in
           conjunction with non-invasive brain stimulation

        -  Repeat testing of motor function of the upper limb and neurophysiology

        -  Repeat MRI testing

        -  A follow-up visit completed 3 months after the completion of interventions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a pilot, randomized controlled study, 24 stroke patients with moderate/severe impairments
      will receive non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or
      rTMS) to one of two targets in the brain in conjunction with upper limb training for 3 days a
      week for 5 weeks. The primary outcome will be upper limb motor impairment, and secondary
      outcomes will be tests of functional abilities, proximal reaching performance and
      patient-reported disability. Associated neural mechanisms will also be studied using
      neurophysiological and functional connectivity MRI techniques. Damage to ipsilesional
      corticospinal pathways will be indexed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

    <intervention_model_description>In a pilot, randomized-controlled, double-blind study, an anticipated 24 patients will be assigned to either receive stimulation to a new brain target- contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (cPMd) located in the non-stroke hemisphere- or the conventional brain target- ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1) located in the stroke hemisphere. Stimulation will be delivered in conjunction with rehabilitation for 3 days a week for 5 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Upper Extremity Fugyl-Meyer Score (UEFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Impairment will be measured using UEFM, one of the most widely used assessments in stroke. UEFM will serve as our primary outcome because it is sensitive to discerning the effects of rTMS/rehabilitation, and has excellent reliability (ICC= 0.97), consistency (Cronbach's Î±= 0.84) and validity. UEFM has a score ranging from 0-66 (0 meaning there is no movement of the paretic arm, and 66 meaning there is no functional limitation of the paretic arm.)</description>

    <measure>Change in Inter-hemispheric Inhibition (IHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-hemispheric connectivity will be characterized using IHI collected with TMS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability to use the paretic upper limb in a variety of tasks will be assessed using WMFT. Time to complete each task will be noted and converted to rate (60/Performance Time (sec)), optimized for measurement in moderately/severely-impaired patients. Grip strength will also be recorded with WMFT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Reaching Response Time</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proximal motor control will be assessed using the reaching response-time task, which, as the name suggests, measures the time required to reach forward and push a cued button. This task is used to characterize motor control in moderately/severely-impaired patients who typically lack adequate distal movements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroke Impact Scale (SIS-16)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's perceived disability related to physical function will be indexed using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS-16) which a subjective questionnaire asked to the subject pertaining of 16 questions. Each question is rated 1-5 and then the scores are totaled. Total scores can range from 16-80 (16 means that none of the functional tasks asked can be performed, a score of 80 means the subject has no issues at all performing any of the tasks asked).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(rsfMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional connectivity will complement IHI measurement as a secondary outcome because while IHI records neurophysiologic interactions between a contralesional and a weak ipsilesional region, functional connectivity defines &quot;global&quot; interactions across multiple regions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ipsilateral MEPs (motor evoked potentials)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, on average 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Output of uncrossed pathways will be studied as ipsilateral MEPs elicited in the paretic-muscle with TMS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DTI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DTI enables the investigation of structural integrity and orientation of pathways in vivo through the estimation of magnitude and directionality of water diffusion. DTI metrics can help quantitate damage even when patients show no response to TMS due to extensive damage (MEP-). Ipsilesional and contralesional corticospinal tracts will be reconstructed using probabilistic tractography. FA, a unit-less measure of white matter integrity, will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive rTMS-based facilitation of the contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (cPMd) located in the non-stroke hemisphere before start of each session. High-frequency rTMS (5-Hz) will be delivered using five 1-min trains of 300 pulses each (total 1500 pulses) for a period of 10 minutes. Immediately after the completion of rTMS, participants will undergo upper limb training for a total of one hour. Participants will receive these interventions 3 days a week for 5 weeks, i.e., for a total of 15 sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive rTMS-based facilitation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1) before the start of each session. iM1 will be facilitated using a widely-used approach of stimulation delivered to inhibit the contralesional motor cortices located in the non-stroke hemisphere. Low-frequency rTMS (1-Hz) can inhibit the excitability of targeted regions. Therefore, this low-frequency approach will be delivered to suppress the excitability of the non-stroke hemisphere. A total of 1500 pulses will be given for 25 minutes. Immediately after the completion of rTMS, participants will undergo upper limb training for a total of one hour. Participants will receive these interventions 3 days a week for 5 weeks, i.e., for a total of 15 sessions.</description>
