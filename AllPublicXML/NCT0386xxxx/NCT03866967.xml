    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm open-label, phase II study to evaluate the anti-tumor
      activity, safety, PK and immunogenicity of AK105 (Anti-PD1 antibody) in patients with
      metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have progressed after at least 2 prior lines of
      systemic chemotherapy (of which one of them must be platinum-based chemotherapy).
