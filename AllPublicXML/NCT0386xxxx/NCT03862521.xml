  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of short-term (6 month) low or very-low
      carbohydrate diets in prepubertal children 2 to &lt;12 years old with type 1 diabetes.
      Participants will be randomized to either low carbohydrate diet (carbohydrate makes up 30-39%
      of total daily calories) or very-low carbohydrate diet (carbohydrates are 20-29% of total
      daily calories). The investigators will evaluate metabolic effects of these diets by
      measuring the counter-regulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia at baseline and again at 3
      months. Other outcomes include diabetes control as measured by HbA1c, growth and weight gain,
      lipid profiles, and body composition.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of short-term (6 month) low or very-low
      carbohydrate diets in prepubertal children 2 to &lt;12 years old with type 1 diabetes.
      Participants will be randomized to either low carbohydrate diet (carbohydrate makes up 30-39%
      of total daily calories) or very-low carbohydrate diet (carbohydrates are 20-29% of total
      daily calories). The investigators will evaluate metabolic effects of these diets by
      measuring the counter-regulatory hormone response to hypoglycemia at baseline and again at 3
      months. Other outcomes include diabetes control as measured by HbA1c, growth and weight gain,
      lipid profiles, and body composition.

      Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center at baseline and 3 months.
      Gradual reduction in serum glucose to under 80 mg/dL will be achieved by an increase in their
      insulin infusion rate through their insulin pump. Plasma glucose, catecholamines
      (epinephrine, norepinephrine), glucagon, and serum ketones are measured at baseline and after
      glucose is below 80 mg/dL. All subjects will have lipid evaluation and body composition (DXA
      scan) at baseline and 6 months. Subjects' growth will be evaluated by comparing their height
      and weight z-score before and after the 6 months of diet intervention. Change in growth
      velocity will also be assessed. During the study, participants not already using continuous
      glucose monitoring will be placed on Dexcom G5 to monitor blood sugars regularly. Subjects
      will also be monitoring serum ketones at home regularly.
