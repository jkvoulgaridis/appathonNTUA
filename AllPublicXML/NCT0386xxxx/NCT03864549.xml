  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific background: Uncontrolled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with
      severe maternal and neonatal morbidities. Treatment of GDM is multidisciplinary and includes
      lifestyle changes and medications. However, the efficacy of these treatments is limited due
      to poor motivation, daily painful blood tests and multiple injections.

      Probiotic supplements were shown to modulate the gut microbiome by reducing the adverse
      metabolic effects associated with pathogenic microbial colonization. Promising effects on
      glycemic control and insulin resistance in non-pregnant diabetic patients were reported.
      However, the effect of probiotics on glycemic control in GDM has not been elucidated.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of a mixture of probiotic strains given daily on maternal
      glycemic parameters, and pregnancy outcomes among women with GDM.

      Working hypothesis: Oral administration of probiotics will be effective in glucose control of
      patients with GDM and their neonates without causing significant adverse effects.

      Type of research and methods of data collection: A prospective randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled trial. Women newly diagnosed with GDM will be recruited and followed in
      the GDM clinic and Maternal-Fetal Medicine ward (including the research clinic) at Emek
      Medical Center. They will be divided into a research group, receiving the probiotic formula
      Femina II and a control group, receiving a placebo (2 capsules/day) until delivery. Glycemic
      control will be evaluated by daily glucose charts. After 2 weeks of diet and
      probiotic/placebo treatment and thereafter, pharmacotherapy will be started in case of poor
      glycemic control according to the daily glucose charts. Blood tests for glycated molecules
      will be performed. Fetal well-being and growth will be assessed. The primary outcomes are:

        1. The rate of women requiring medications for glycemic control

        2. Mean value of the mean daily glucose charts after 2 weeks of treatment with the study
           products.
