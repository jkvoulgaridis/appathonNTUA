  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to contribute to nursing practices by developing and stress incontinence
      care protocol with the help of the Star model and implementing this care protocol for the
      purpose of standardizing patient care outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To identify the effectiveness of a care protocol developed using the Star model on outcomes
      in female patients with stress incontinence.

      Information and evidence needs to be translated into nursing practice and applied to clinical
      decision-making in stress incontinence cases. Evidence-based study models such as the Star
      model provide guidance on using evidence to develop clinical guidelines and care protocols.
      The Star model is designed to improve patient outcomes by creating a bridge between research
      and clinical practice. There is currently no published stress incontinence care protocol
      based on the Star model. Although there is one published study of a care protocol for urinary
      incontinence, this protocol was not drawn up on the basis of an evidence-based model.

      Women that matched the sample criteria were recruited into the study. After their consent was
      obtained, the women were randomized into an intervention and a control group. The women in
      the intervention group were provided care according to stress incontinence care protocol. The
      control group received no intervention during the eight-week intervention period.

    <measure>King's Health Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>This 32-item tool measures quality of life. Scores range from 0 - 100, with low scores indicating good quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Broome Pelvic Muscle Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument was developed to measure perceived self-efficacy in pelvic floor muscle exercise. It consists of 23 items organized in two subscales. The total score ranges from 0 - 100 and scores are classified as follows: ≤ 32(low self-efficacy); 33 55 points (medium self-efficacy); ≥ 56 points (high self-efficacy).</description>

    <measure>Three-day voiding diary</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a semi-objective tool used to record voiding frequency, amount of urine, amount and type of liquid intake, incontinence frequency and the frequency of pad-changing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>One-hour pad test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>This test provides an objective measure of the quantity of urine leakage in a one-hour period. Before the test, the dry pad is weighed using precision scales and this weight is deducted from the wet weight to give the weight of leaked urine (Krhut et al., 2014). First the patient is given the pre-weighed pad and is then asked to drink 500 cc water and to rest in a seated position for a half-hour. In the following half- hour, the patient stands up and sits down 10 times, coughs 10 times, runs in place for 1 minute, bends to pick something up from the floor 5 times, and then climbs a flight of stairs. After one hour, the pad is taken from the patient and re-weighed on the same precision scales. The weight of the dry pad is deducted from the weight of the wet pad and the weight of urine is recorded.</description>

    <description>The intervention group received care according to the SICP (Table 2). One of the researchers gave each participant one-on-one education in line with SICP. They were also provided with the booklet that had been prepared in accordance with SICP. The participants were phoned every week for eight weeks and offered counseling within the scope of SICP and then were reevaluated at the end of eight weeks (Post-intervention). The participants were followed from the eighth to the twelfth week without any intervention (4-week post-intervention).</description>
