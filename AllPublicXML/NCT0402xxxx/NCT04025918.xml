  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension occurs commonly during spinal anesthesia for caesarean section with maternal and
      fetal adverse effects. The investigators developed a double-vasopressor automated system
      incorporating continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring (CNAP, CNSystems,
      Austria).

      Hypotension occurs commonly during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section with maternal and
      fetal adverse effects. The investigators developed a double-vasopressor automated system
      incorporating continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP, CNSystems, Austria) monitoring
      feeding hemodynamic data to a laptop computer, which triggers syringe pumps to deliver
      phenylephrine 50mcg or ephedrine 4mg (if heart rate&lt;60 beats.min-1) every 30 seconds when
      systolic blood pressure fell to below 90% of baseline.

      A randomised controlled trial was done to compare with manual bolus technique. With the
      manual bolus technique, phenylephrine 100mcg or ephedrine 8mg (if heart rate&lt;60 beats.min-1)
      was given every 60 seconds by the attending anesthesiologist when systolic blood pressure was
      below 90% of baseline as measured by conventional intermittent non-invasive blood pressure
      monitoring.
