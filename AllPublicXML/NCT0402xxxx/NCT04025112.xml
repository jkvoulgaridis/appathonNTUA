      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of rehabilitation robotics in upper limb
      functionality involved in the surgical treatment of breast cancer. The study will be
      conducted following the delineation of randomized clinical trial. It will be assessed 108
      women aged between 30 and 60 years, submitted to surgical treatment of breast cancer and
      axillary dissection.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common neoplasia types, with greater involvement in the
      female population, showing a high mortality rate in Brazil, due to diagnosis in advanced
      stages. With the increased survival of women treated for breast cancer, the evaluation of the
      effect of therapeutic resources for the morbidities resulting from surgical treatment of
      breast cancer are essential. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      rehabilitation robotics in upper limb functionality involved in the surgical treatment of
      breast cancer. The study will be conducted following the delineation of randomized clinical
      trial. It will be assessed 108 women aged between 30 and 60 years submitted to surgical
      treatment of breast cancer and axillary dissection, divided between two equal groups: control
      group (GC) - composed of women who had undergone conventional rehabilitation and experimental
      group (GE) - composed of women who had undergone rehabilitation robotics. The data obtained
      in the study aim to improve the forms of intervention against the functional alterations
      resulting from surgical treatment.
