      INTRODUCTION

      TURBT [transurethral resection of bladder tumor] constitutes a crucial procedure in the
      diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. A complete resection should be achieved either in
      fractions in bigger, or en-bloc in smaller tumours. The incise and scattering technique is
      against all oncological principles, damage caused by heat and fragmentation of the tumour
      hampers histological processing. The technique of resection in fractions ignores the
      parameter of negative surgical margins, theoretically, liberating tumour cells into the
      irrigation fluid, which facilitates their implantation and early recurrence. Furthermore,
      pathological staging may be impaired.

      The absence of lamina muscularis propria (LMP, detrusor muscle, DM) in the specimen is
      associated with a higher risk of residual disease and early recurrence. Absence of LMP is
      also associated with lower surgical experience. The frequency of detecting MIBC in the second
      resection in initial pT1 ranges from 4 to 25%, and increases to 45% when no LMP was present.
      European guidelines 2018, stated that, En-bloc resection using monopolar or bipolar current,
      Thulium-YAG or Holmium-YAG laser is feasible in selected exophytic tumours. It provides high
      quality resected specimens with the presence of detrusor muscle in 96-100% of cases.

      Recently, Martin-Doyle et al in the large analysis of 15,215 patients to assess recurrence,
      progression, and cancer-specific survival (CSS) from 73 studies, the highest impact risk
      factor was depth of invasion (T1b/c) into lamina propria (progression: [HR], 3.34; P &lt; .001;
      cancer-specific survival: HR, 2.02; P = .001). Other previously proposed factors also
      predicted progression and CSS (lymphovascular invasion (LVI), associated CIS, non-use of
      bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), tumor size &gt; 3 cm, and older age; HRs for progression between
      1.32 and 2.88, P ≤ .002; HRs for CSS between 1.28 and 2.08, P ≤ .02).

      2018 EUA guidelines stated that, the depth and extent of invasion into the lamina propria (T1
      substaging) has been demonstrated to be of prognostic value in retrospective cohort studies
      (LE: 3). Its use is recommended by the most recent 2016 World Health Organization (WHO)
      classification. However, the optimal system to substage T1 remains to be defined (Babjuk et
      al., 2018). These difficulty may be attributed to muscularis mucosa is only identified in 15%
      to 80% of bladder biopsy specimens, though its presence in 90% of radical cystectomy
      specimens (Wood, 2012). We have hypothesis that enbloc resection can get muscularis mucosa
      rate similar to radical cystectomy specimens rate.

      In the last decade, the en-bloc resection of bladder tumor (ERBT) as an alternative to TURBT
      has gained more and more interest among urologists. Theoretically, ERBT offers three goals:
      to improve the resection quality, lowering perioperative complication rates, and decreasing
      recurrence rates. A new envisaged goal is also to decrease the number of second TURBTs. By
      using the correct ERBT technique, higher DM rates in comparison with TURBT can be achieved
      (theoretically up to 100%)(Kramer et al., 2017) In a recent study with more than 2000
      patients of pT1 high-grade tumor, the most important parameter that was associated with
      recurrence-free survival was the detection of DM within the tissue. The authors stated that
      in case that DM is present one may even avoid second resections in high-risk NMIBC.

      In a retrospective multicentre study (EBRUC) with 221 patients in 4 arms, median tumour size
      was 2.1 cm and largest tumours reached even 5 cm, with LMP being present in 97.3 %. All
      techniques have in common that first a circular incision is made in the mucosa around the
      tumour. Subsequently, the tumour is dissected en-bloc including muscle layer using
      monopolar/bipolar current or holmium/thulium laser energy. Up to date, no clear answer can be
      given which patient is suitable for enbloc resection. Roughly, 30% of patients are not
      eligible because of tumor size, formation, and localization. The challenge of large specimen
      retrieval could be solved using the combination of vaporisation of the exophytic tumour part
      and En bloc resection of the tumour ground.

      Although bipolar current hypothetically be favorable with regard to the obturator nerve
      reflex and subsequent bladder perforation (0.9% vs. 6.4%) when compared with monopolar
      current. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Cui et al found no statistically
      significant differences in obturator nerve reflex between bipolar and monopolar TURBT (OR=
      0.35; 95% CI, 0.06-1.95; P = 0.23) and also no differences on bladder perforation (OR= 0.51;
      95% CI, 0.25-1.01; P = .05). European guidelines 2018, stated that though bipolar resection
      has been introduced to reduce the risk of complications (e.g., bladder perforation due to
      obturator nerve stimulation) and to produce better specimens for the pathologist. Currently,
      the results remain controversial.

      Apart from a multitude of retrospective cohort or comparison studies, only two prospective,
      randomized trials on ERBT have been published. Both studies were performed in China, and
      details on statistical preparation, patient selection, and definitions of primary and
      secondary goals are missing. Thus, there is still an urgent need a thoroughly planned trial.

      AIMS OF THE WORK

      Evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of laser and electrical enbloc resection of non
      muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      Detect exact criteria of tumours eligible for enbloc resection either by laser or
      electro-surgical energy.

      Patients &amp; Methods

      I. Study Design:

      The design of the research will be a prospective randomised controlled study.

      II. Study Setting/Location:

      The study will be conducted in a single tertiary centre at Urology and Nephrology Center in
      Mansoura, Egypt.

      Eligible patient presented with visual criteria suggesting NMIBC by outpatient cystoscopy.
      Patients will be asked to participate in this study and will be provided with an informed
      consent form in line with Good Clinical Practise and the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Recruitment of participants Patients appointed for an outpatient diagnostic cystoscopy will
      be reviewed for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Legible patients will be asked to
      participate in the study and to sign the informed consent form.

      Randomisation Randomization will be performed using computer generated random tables using
      stratified blocked randomization in 1:1 ratio.

      peri procedure work up Preoperative evaluations included: detailed medical history, physical
      examination, routine blood examination, urinalysis &amp; urine cytology, renal and liver function
      tests, ultrasonography, thoracic radiography, computed tomography with contrast scans of the
      abdomen and pelvis or MRU, Every patient will undergo cystoscopy.

      Intervention All the surgeries will be performed in lithotomy position under spinal or
      general anesthesia.

      One group will be managed by 2-micron wave length laser ERBT while the other group will be
      managed by electro-surgical ERBT.

      Principles of enbloc resection will be applied similarly in both groups by starting the
      procedure with circumferential incision few millimetres around the tumour then lifting the
      tumour and dissection underneath its muscle base
