  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a prevalent symptom in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) that limits
      patients in their daily living activities. It is now well established that COPD patients may
      have altered neuromuscular functions compared to healthy individuals. However, the different
      studies conducted on muscle fatigue in COPD have been done independently of any cognitive
      solicitation, yet present in most of daily living activities. Therefore, the aim of this
      research is to evaluate the impact of the disease on neuromuscular fatigue during dual-task
      situation (simultaneous accomplishment of a muscle contraction and a cognitive task). A
      better understanding of fatigue in COPD will promote the development of new perspectives in
      patient management.

      The hypothesis is that COPD patients will exhibit increased fatigue level (compared to
      healthy subjects), particularly during dual-task situation. It is assumed that the higher
      negative effect associated with the dual-task will be related to different neurophysiological
      mechanisms (i.e., neuromuscular fatigue, autonomic nervous system activity, mental fatigue).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include three experimental sessions for both COPD patients and healthy
      participants. These experimental sessions will be performed on three separate days. Each
      session will last between 1.5 and 2 hours.

      The first session will correspond to a familiarization session with the different tests that
      will be performed during the two next sessions. During this first session, different
      functional tests will be also performed : 1-minute sit-to-stand tests and postural tests,
      with and without a concomitant cognitive task.

      The second and third sessions will correspond to experimental sessions during which the
      participants will accomplish a fatiguing task in single or dual-task situation (randomized
      order). The cognitive task will be a memory cognitive task, called n-back task. The fatiguing
      tasks will involve submaximal isometric contractions of the knee extensors performed until
      task failure. The neuromuscular fatigue will be evaluated regularly during the fatiguing
      tasks (i.e. about each minute) using the magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve in order
      to assess to central and peripheral determinants of the neuromuscular fatigue. Moreover, the
      autonomic nervous system activity (via cardiac recordings), perceived exertion and cognitive
      performance (in dual-task situation) will be continuously recorded during the fatiguing
      tasks. Before and after each fatiguing tasks, several questionnaires will be completed (i.e.
      mood, motivation, subjective workload) in order to evaluate the psychological determinants of
      performance.

    <description>The endurance times will correspond to the duration of the fatiguing tasks (simple and dual-task). The endurance time differences between simple and dual-task conditions will be calculated as follows : Endurance time in simple task condition - Endurance time in dual-task condition = Difference of endurance time.</description>

    <description>Psychology influence on task performance will be evaluated with questionnaires before, during and after the task. For motivation: 14 items, scores from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), 2 subscales assessing intrinsic and success-based motivation (scores from 0 to 28). For mood: 24 adjectives, scores from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), 6 subscales evaluating fatigue, confusion, vigor, depression, tension and anger (scores from 0 to 16). For Rating-of-Fatigue scale: one score from 0 (not tired) to 10 (exhaustion). For dyspnea: one score from 0 (nothing) to 10 (extremely strong). For Task Load Index: 6 subscales, from 0 (very low) to 20 (very high), measure mental and physical difficulties, time pressure, performance perception, effort perception and frustration. For Sleep Quality Index: 24 questions, 7 subscales from 0 to 3 evaluating subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, sleep medication and day dysfunction due to sleepiness.</description>
