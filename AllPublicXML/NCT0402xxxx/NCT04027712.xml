  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased circulating b-amyloid and decreased Mitochondrial-derived peptide (MOTS-c), a
      peptide improving tissue insulin sensitivity, are reported in diabetes. The investigators
      plan to investigate the association of both biofactors with high on-clopidogrel platelet
      reactivity and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with Coronary artery
      disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In type II diabetic patients with Coronary artery disease treated with clopidogrel and
      aspirin, the investigators plan to measure: i. maximum platelet aggregation to adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTAmax), as a marker of on-clopidogrel
      treatment platelet reactivity ii. Malondialdehyde (MDA), as oxidative stress marker,
      Mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c and b-amyloid. blood levels.
