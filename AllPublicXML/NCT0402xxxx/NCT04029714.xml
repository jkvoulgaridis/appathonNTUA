  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of men with prostate cancer are overdiagnosed and overtreated mainly due
      to PSA testing. Active surveillance (AS) aims to reduce these harms by recommending curative
      treatment only when and if signs of tumour progression occur. There are however a number of
      uncertainties in AS, the most important being when to initiate treatment.

      Therefore, the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG) are running a large multi-centre
      randomised control trial (RCT) to test the safety of a standardized active surveillance
      protocol with specific triggers for repeat biopsies and initiation of curative treatment,
      compared to the current practice for active surveillance. They are recruiting in multiple
      sites in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. The primary aim is to reduce overtreatment and
      subsequent side effects, without increasing the risk of disease progression or prostate
      cancer mortality.

      In the UK, there is also no set criteria for when to re-biopsy and/or initiate curative
      treatment for patients on AS and tends to be at the clinician's discretion. Thus, PCASTT-UK
      has been established to run as a parallel RCT and add to the findings from SPCG-17.

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS The aim of this trial is to test the safety of an Active Surveillance
      protocol comparing current practice to standardized triggers for initiation of curative
      treatment, based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging or biopsy pathology. The study hypothesis is
      that standardized triggers will reduce overtreatment without increasing disease progression
      and prostate cancer mortality.

      STUDY DESIGN Randomized multi-centre open-label clinical trial.

      INTERVENTIONS Patients within 12 months of a diagnosis of prostate cancer will be approached
      and consented to the study. Computerised randomisation (1:1) will assign participants to
      either the control (Arm 1) or intervention arm (Arm 2). In the control arm, patients will be
      treated according to active surveillance protocol at the trial centre; in the intervention
      arm patients will follow standardised active surveillance protocol applying specific criteria
      for repeat biopsies and the initiation of curative treatment. Patients are stratified by
      centre and Gleason score.

      FOLLOW UP In both arms, patients will followed up for 10 years with the following schedule: a
      PSA test every 6 months, clinical examination (with PSA test) and Quality of Life (QoL)
      questionnaire annually, and MRI every second year. Re-biopsy and/or initiation of curative
      treatment depends on the trial arm patients are randomised to.

      Repeat biopsies

      Arm 1 (control arm): according to current practice (urologists' judgement)

      Arm 2 (intervention arm): standardised triggers

        -  A systematic repeat biopsy if PSA density increases to &gt; 0.2 ng/ml/cc, and then at every
           0.1 ng/ml/cc increase

        -  MRI progression in men with previously only Gleason grade 3+3: 5 mm or more increase in
           size in any dimension of a measurable lesion, increase in PI-RADS score to 3-5, a new
           lesion with PI-RADS score 3-5, or high or very high suspicion of extra-capsular
           extension or seminal vesicle invasion

        -  MRI progression in men with Gleason grade 3+4: 5 mm or more increase in size in any
           dimension of a measurable lesion, or a new lesion with PI-RADS score 3-5

      Curative treatment

      Arm 1 (control arm): According to current practice (urologists judgement)

      Arm 2 (intervention arm): standardised triggers

        -  MRI progression in lesions with confirmed Gleason grade 4: increase in PI-RADS score to
           4 or 5, or high or very high suspicion of extra-capsular extension or seminal vesicle
           invasion

        -  Pathological progression: Gleason pattern 5, primary Gleason pattern 4 in any core with
           5 mm or more cancer, Gleason 3+4 in 3 or more cores or 30% if more than 10 cores are
           taken, or Gleason 3+4 in 10 mm or more cancer

      Patients will remain on trial unless they end Active Surveillance due to initiation of
      treatment, development of metastases, transition to watchful waiting, or death of any cause.
      After the initiation of curative treatment, watchful waiting, or palliative treatment for
      cancer progression, the patient is treated according to the standard protocol of the
      participating centre.

    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as cumulative incidence of PSA relapse following curative treatment and cumulative incidence of androgen therapy in untreated men. Following radical prostatectomy, biochemical recurrence is defined by two consecutively rising PSA values &gt;0.2 ng/ml. After radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy, the definition of PSA failure is any rise by 2 ng/ml or more above the nadir PSA value, regardless of the serum concentration of the nadir.</description>
