  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to validate the Assist-Knee design and function by collecting
      pilot data during the stand-to-sit-to-stand transition in transfemoral prosthesis users when
      using the Assist-Knee to harvest energy and return energy .
