      This research project's objective is to investigate substrate metabolism behavior in response
      to the RT during different phases of the menstrual cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the literature the investigators hypothesize an increase in fat oxidation in early
      follicular phase(EFP) and late follicular phase (LFP) when compared to early luteal phase
      (ELP) and late luteal phase (LLP). Given the lack of research in exercise and menstrual cycle
      - especially in resistance training - results are uncertain unless the investigators base
      their hypotheses only on the general physiological effects of sex hormones (without
      exercise). In this case, the investigators expect to see a reduced carbohydrate utilization
      and an increased utilization of fats in EFP and LFP. In addition, the intervention is focused
      on muscular endurance and, therefore, it is expected to see a higher reliance on aerobic
      pathways. It is expected that the effects of the intervention will be added to the effects of
      estrogens, with increasing fat oxidation when estrogen levels are higher. Lastly, a
      comparison of fat oxidation levels obtained on each sub-phase would reveal if there are
      differences in the magnitude of the effect of distinct concentrations of estrogen and
      progesterone.

    <intervention_model_description>The participants will be randomized into either one of the 4 four phases- namely Early Follicular Phase(EFP-Days1 to 7), Late Follicular Phase(LFP-Days 8 to 14), Early Luteal Phase(ELP-Days 15 to 21) or Late Luteal Phase(LLP-Days 22 to 28) of the menstrual phase. Once the participant is assigned to one of the phases. Each participant will undergo 4 intervention days. the first intervention day will take place during the mid-point of the said phase i.e. EFP- Day 4. After one intervention is complete there will be a washout period and the intervention will take place on the 7th day after the first intervention i.e if the first intervention is LFP done on day 11 of the menstrual cycle the next intervention will take place on day 18 of menstrual cycle which will account for ELP. In this manner, the Participant will be tested in all 4 phases.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females with BMI-18.5-34.99 and between 18-45 years, with normal menstrual cycle
             defined as 28-30 days cycles +-3 days.

          -  Including higher BMI participants might alter the results as increased body fat has
             been linked to changes in different hormonal levels (not only sex hormones) and that
             might influence substrate utilization.

          -  Sedentary .or physically active for 2 days a week or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Musculoskeletal injuries,

               -  cardio-respiratory conditions,

               -  metabolic conditions,

               -  irregular menstrual cycle,

               -  menstrual dysfunction or unusual sex hormone levels,

               -  on contraceptives,

               -  on medication that alter hormonal or cardio-respiratory responses,

               -  pre-menopausal symptoms,

               -  on moderate to high-intensity exercise regime more than 2d/week.

               -  All these exclusion criteria are chosen because any one of the listed criteria
                  above can alter the responses and/or affect the safety of the subject during
                  their participation in the study.
