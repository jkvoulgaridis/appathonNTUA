  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social cognition impairments, frequently encountered in Serial Mental Illness, reduce the
      ability to find and to keep a job. Cognitive remediation and social cognition training reduce
      the impact of cognitive impairments on work outcomes . The purpose of this research is to
      associate a social cognition training program to vocational rehabilitation in the transition
      network (transitional Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services) to help people to
      maintain their jobs and to access to work in an ordinary environment. To support the
      development of social cognition interventions, additional care (users will retain their usual
      medical follow-up) will be implemented within the Workforce Assistance Facilities and
      Services.

      This project is part of a strong partnership between the Cognitive remediation network
      (health sector: rehabilitation centers) and the Transition network (medico-social sector:
      three Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services having partnerships with rehabilitation
      centers). This partnership has been experienced previously in the RemedRehab project funded
      by the 2012 hospital clinical research program (PHRC). This project was recently completed.

      Social cognition training concomitant to work help to maintain employment in transitional
      Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services .

      Participation in the study will be offered to anyone with severe psychic disorders and a
      social cognition disorder who started working in one of the transitional Workforce Assistance
      Facilities and Services in the year prior to inclusion to limit selection bias.

      The study population is defined by the transitional Workforce Assistance Facilities and
      Services users involved.

      The diagnosis is not included in the inclusion criteria. It will, however, be established
      according to DSM-5 criteria for included users, who will benefit from a semi-structured
      interview .

      The expected benefits in the social cognition training programgroup are: best job maintaining
      rate in transitional Workforce Assistance Facilities and Services , improvement of social
      cognition, improvement of interpersonal skills, improvement of self-esteem, improvement of
      professional insertion and improvement of the patient's vision of his place in society.

      Participants enrolled in information group may expect benefits on socialization and
