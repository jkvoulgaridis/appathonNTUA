  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common smoking-related lung disease.

      Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a six-week supervised group exercise and education class. PR
      is an effective intervention in COPD to reduce symptoms, improve exercise performance and
      prevent exacerbation. Exercise intolerance/limitation is one of the commonest issues with
      COPD patients and this may be compounded by reduced muscle mass and malnutrition. COPD
      patients lose body weight and skeletal muscle mass which leads to muscle weakness and
      dysfunction, thus impacting functional ability and quality of life. Muscle weakness is caused
      by a prolonged sedentary lifestyle and voluntary immobilization. Importantly, being
      under-weight is associated with an increased risk of mortality in COPD.

      Nutritional supplementation have been used to overcome malnutrition in COPD patients. It has
      been shown that nutritional support integrated with exercise training can improve exercise
      activity, decreased the risk of mortality, and improve muscle strength in undernourished COPD
      patients. However, uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation,
      where the potential benefit may be greatest, has been limited by the absence of rigorous
      evidence-based studies supporting use.

      Investigators want to investigate the effect of a nutritional supplement during a PR program
      on exercise capacity in COPD patients. Investigators will collect demographic data,
      distribute questionnaires, measure exercise performance, and some additional measurements.
