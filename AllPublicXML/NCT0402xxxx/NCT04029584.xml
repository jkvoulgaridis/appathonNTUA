  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) transporter inhibition at
      clinical doses of fluvastatin, a biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system
      (BDDCS) class 1 drug, has not been studied to date. A single dose of IV rifampin can be used
      as model OATP1B1 inhibitor to evaluate the significance of OATP1B1 transporter effects on
      fluvastatin disposition. A preinduction regimen of oral rifampin followed by a single IV
      infusion of rifampin can be used to evaluate the combined effects of enzyme induction and
      OATP1B1 transporter inhibition on fluvastatin disposition. A two arm, randomized, open label,
      crossover clinical study in healthy, volunteers will be conducted to evaluate the effects of
      IV rifampin on fluvastatin disposition in both hepatically induced and uninduced subjects.

      The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin will be studied in healthy
      volunteers in a two arms, two-period, randomized, unblinded, crossover clinical trial. In the
      first arm, subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups:

      (i)fluvastatin (Lescol®) 20mg capsule (ii) one oral dose of fluvastatin (Lescol®) 20mg
      capsule immediately following a 30-min intravenous infusion of rifampin 600mg in 10ml Normal
      Saline.

      In the second arms, patients will be pretreated with 600mg oral rifampin (two 300mg rifadin
      capsule) once daily to induce hepatic enzymes (and transporters) for 5 years. Subjects will
      be randomized to one of two treatment groups:

      (i) one oral dose of fluvastatin (Lescol®) 20mg capsule (ii) one oral dose of fluvastatin
      (Lescol®) 20mg capsule immediately following a 30-min intravenous infusion of rifampin 600mg
      in 10ml Normal Saline

    <description>The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin will be studied in healthy volunteers in a two-period, randomized, unblinded, crossover clinical trial. On period 1 of the study, subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: (i) one oral dose of fluvastatin (Lescol®) 20mg capsule (ii) one oral dose of fluvastatin (Lescol®) 20mg capsule immediately following a 30-min intravenous infusion of rifampin 600mg in 10ml Normal Saline.
The two study periods will preferentially be separated by one day of washout. Subjects will be instructed to fast overnight the day before study periods 1 and 2, and for 3h post-dosing. In both treatments, venous blood samples (~8ml each) will be drawn at 0, 0.33, 0.67, 1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12h after fluvastatin dosing. During Period 2, subjects will receive the second treatment, followed by blood draws at the same time points as after fluvastatin dosing alone.</description>
