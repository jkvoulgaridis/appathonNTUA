      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Tropisetron in
      preventing emergence delirium.

      Delirium is a common complication during postoperative period, especially in elderly
      patients. The presence of postoperative delirium is independently associated with poor
      recovery, increased length of hospital stay, the development of long-term cognitive decline
      and increased mortality.

      Tropisetron is a 5-HT3A receptor antagonist and is widely used to treat postoperative nausea
      and vomiting. Previous studies found that tropisetron has positive effect on cognitive
      function. This study aims to access the efficacy and safety of tropisetron in preventing
      emergence delirium.

      To explore the results differences amongst different patients, subgroup analysis will be
      conducted according to: a. Age (older than 65 years versus 65 years or younger); b. Surgery
      type (major surgery versus minor surgery); c. Preoperative MoCA scores (&gt;26 versus 18-26
      versus 10-17).
