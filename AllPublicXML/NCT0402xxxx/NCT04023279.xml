  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the additive effect of myofascial release therapy on the brachial biceps
      on conventional management (TENS) in pain intensity, hand prehensile strength and upper limb
      functionality of individuals with lateral epicondylalgia.

      This study determined the additive effect of the myofascial release therapy of brachial
      biceps on TENS in the variables pain intensity, hand prehensile strength and upper limb
      functionality of individuals with lateral epicondylalgia, compared to a group that received
      only TENS. This was done in a sample of 32 individuals, assigned in two groups: group A that
      received an application of TENS and group B that received an application of TENS plus
      myofascial release therapy.

      Contrary to the hypothesis, the application of myofascial release therapy added to the
      application of TENS proved to generate a significant change only in the prehensile hand force
      with respect to the group that received only TENS.

    <masking_description>The hidden assignment of the participants was carried out using the method of opaque envelopes sealed and numbered consecutively.
The assessor in charge of evaluating the participants was blind to the treatment assignment, where he proceeded to take the measurements with a prior instruction of the procedures.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity numerical rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported measure of pain intensity. It consists on asking to assess pain intensity by selecting a number on a scale of 11 horizontal points. It is represented from 0 (without pain) to 10 (the worst possible pain) A score of 1 to 4 indicates mild pain; 5-6, moderate pain; and 7 to 10, severe pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Is the minimum pressure that induces pain or discomfort. It was measured with a algometer. It is expressed in units of pressure as kilograms per square centimeter per second (Kg / cm2 / s).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prehensile hand strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is the ability to compress the hand, related to the functional integrity of the upper extremity as an index of general health. It was measured with a dynamometer. It was measured according to the criteria established by the American Society of Hand Therapists. It is measured in kilograms</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Elbow functionality.</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Functionality is a generic term that includes bodily functions, body structures, activities and participation. It shows the positive aspects of a person's interaction and the context. It was obtained through a scale of functionality (Oxford Elbow Score), which is composed of three domains (subscales); elbow, pain and social-psychological function, which underlie 12 questions, which are internally consistent, one-dimensional and do not have redundancy of items.
The scores of each domain are calculated as the sum of the score of each individual element, where each case is expressed on a scale from 0 to 100 where, a score of 0.84 indicates a substantial improvement.</description>
