  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary recruitment maneuvers open these lung areas and appropriate adjustment of positive
      expiratory pressure (PEP) helps to stabilize recruitment and reduce the stress associated
      with alveolar opening and closing. Its beneficial effects in the lung affected by Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remain unclear. The hypothesis is that there is a
      heterogeneous effect of the recruitment maneuver according to the phenotype of ARDS. It is
      important to be able to define responder patients from non-responders to this recruiting
      maneuver.

      It will be a prospective interventional study in resuscitation patients with severe or
      moderate ARDS. This study will be multicentric between the University Hospital of Amiens and
      intensive care of Lens, intensive care of Bethune and intensive care of Arras. All patients
      in intensive care and severe, moderate ARDS will be included in this study. All patients will
      benefit from Lung ultrasound (LUS) with a mapping of each lung looking for normal or
      pathological lung profiles, as well as a measurement of esophageal pressure (Peso) at rest. A
      &quot;PEP titration pulmonary opening&quot; (PEP-OP) test using a recruitment maneuver was then
      performed in all patients followed by a new LUS and Peso measurement.
