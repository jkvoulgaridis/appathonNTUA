  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind study (OMK1 vs. Placebo) A total of 90 patients, 30 per center, will be the
      study sample. The study will include patients with Primary Open angle Glaucoma (glaucoma or
      pseudoexfoliation) with a loss of visual field with MD between -2 dB and -15 decibel.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 treatment groups, both treated with hypotonic ocular drug
      therapy: one part of the patients will be treated with the OMK1 Medical Device containing
      topical citicoline for 3 years; the remaining part will receive a placebo.

      All patients will be followed with quarterly visits which will check, in addition to the
      intraocular pressure (IOP), the structure of the optic nerve and visual function (standard
      visual field).

      The primary objective is to evaluate a reduction of the perimetric progression in the group
      that receives the topical citicoline compared to the group treated with placebo. The
      reduction of the progression will be evaluated with Spectral Domain Optic coherence
      tomography and with standard perimetry (SAP).

      The secondary objective is to assess the tolerability and safety of OMK1 eye drops.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to assess whether there is a difference in the deterioration of glaucomatous damage with standard perimetry (HFA 24-2 and 10-2) in the group that receives the topical citicoline in addition to topical therapy with hypotensive drugs compared to the group treated with the sole reduction of intraocular pressure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with POAG and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma in one or both eyes. In the latter
             case, only one eye (chosen at random) will be used for the analysis.

          -  Patients with -2 &lt; MD &lt; -15 dB, progression of MD at least -0,5 dB/y for 2 years.

          -  Patients with tonometric compensation, i.e., IOP not above 18 mmHg. Tonometric
             compensation can be achieved with any type of hypotonic medical therapy and must be
             maintained during the 3 years of the study. If at any check-up the average of at least
             3 measurements of IOP at different times is higher than 18 mmHg, the patient will be
             offered a new hypotonic treatment (including surgery) to control the progression of
             the disease. If compensation cannot be achieved (e.g., the patient refuses the
             proposed therapy or, in spite of this does not achieve satisfactory IOP values), the
             patient will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients over the age of 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with contraindications to citicoline

          -  Patients with IOP higher than 18 mmHg

          -  Patients with other forms of glaucoma

          -  Patients treated with other neuroprotective therapies

          -  Women who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding

          -  Pediatric or adolescent patients aged under 18 years
