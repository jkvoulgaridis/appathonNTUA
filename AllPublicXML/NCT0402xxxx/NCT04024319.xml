  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis affects one third of the population over 65 years old. Total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) has become one of the most frequent surgical procedures in the world.
      During the last years it went from being a long hospital stay surgery to a fast track
      procedure. Currently models employ high volume local infiltration techniques (LIA). The
      genicular nerve block (GNB) appears as alternative in this patients.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic results of genicular nerve block
      after TKA in a small cohort of patients.

      35 patients scheduled for TKA underwent to GNB were included. Pain measurement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An observational study of a series of 35 cases will be carried out based on the casuistry of
      TKR surgery of the investigator's center. The performance of analgesic blockade called GNB in
      adult patients, ASA physical status I-III, which will undergo TKR, will be part of the
      multimodal analgesia strategy.

      After compliance with the inclusion criteria, with the acceptance and signature of the
      informed consent by the participating patients, the following procedure will be followed:

        1. Patients will be routinely assessed by an anesthesiologist of the service, later they
           will enter the operating room, where the vital signs will be monitored and the usual
           anesthetic technique will be used for TKR, that is, spinal anesthesia.

        2. To perform the blocks a 90 mm needle was used, with a 30mm extension connected to a 20ml
           syringe with a mixture of 20ml of 0.2% ropivacaine + 200 micrograms of adrenaline. The
           needle will be advanced with an out-of-plane technique and 4 ml of the described
           solution will be placed in each of the 5 nerves to be blocked: Superomedial genicular
           nerve (SMGN), Superolateral genicular nerve (SLGN), Inferomedial genicular nerve (IMGN),
           Inferolateral genicular nerve (ILGN) and Recurrent tibial genicular nerve (RTGN) .

        3. The pain assessment will be carried out during the night after the intervention
           (approximately 12 hours) and the next morning (approximately 24 hours). The pain will be
           objectified by (VAS) (0-10) by a nurse, blind to the analgesic treatment. The use of
           rescue opioids will be indicated in case of VAS ≥ 3, data that will also be analyzed. In
           the room, the pharmacological treatment established as an institutional protocol will
           continue. It should be noted that these data as well as demographic data, intraoperative
           times, and relevant post-operative data (hematocrit, complication) were obtained from
           the clinical records of the electronic file of the program used in the internal network
           of the Barcelona Clinic Hospital

        4. Researchers will record those variables aimed at evaluating the intensity of acute
           postoperative pain 24 hours after TKR (Pain score ≥ 4 in any time).

      These results will be included, anonymously, in an Excel database made for this purpose for
      further analysis. The variables will be recorded in a single intervention

    <description>GNB will be performed on this group of patients undergoing TKR. The patient will be positioned in the supine position, with the extremity to operate slightly in external rotation. The anesthesiologist will be located ipsilateral to the knee to intervene; asepsis will be performed with 70% chlorhexidine, sterile gloves will be used and the ultrasound probe will be protected with a sterile cover. The ultrasound transducer will be placed in a long axis of the knee in the corresponding area to block according to anatomical repairs. 4 ml of 0,2% ropivacaine was administered in each GN.</description>

    <description>Retrospectively, the data of the patients belonging to the control group (LIA) were collected through the electronic file in the SAPP program of the internal network of the Barcelona Clinic Hospital in chronological order until completing 35 cases. To include them in the control group, the patients had to meet the same criteria as those belonging to the intervention group (GNB), therefore, the surgery should have been performed under spinal anesthesia and subsequently followed with an oral analgesia schedule meeting criteria of fast track hospitalization. The same data were obtained as in the GNBG, demographic data (age, sex, weight, height, hematocrit, hemoglobin, ASA), duration of the surgery and ischemia time, PACU VAS, AM VAS, PM VAS and finally some data of the post-operative period (hematocrit, hemoglobin, transfusion, hospital stay)</description>
