    <textblock>
      Study BP41192 is a randomized, adaptive, placebo-controlled parallel group study to
      investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending
      intravenous (IV) doses of RO7126209 in healthy participants. RO7126209 is being developed for
      the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a parallel group design, with participants recruited in 5 planned sequential
      cohorts. Additional cohort(s) may be added if dose escalation stopping criteria are not met
      after cohort 5. Participants will receive a single IV dose of either RO7126209 or placebo.
      RO7126209 doses will be administered in ascending order. After the starting dose, subsequent
      doses will be selected in an adaptive manner during study conduct based on emerging safety,
      tolerability and PK data.
