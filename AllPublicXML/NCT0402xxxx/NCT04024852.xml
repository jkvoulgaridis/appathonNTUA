      This study investigated whether patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
      who followed advice to exercise indoors on high air pollution days had reduced adverse
      impacts on cardiovascular measures compared with those who exercised outdoors on those days.
      Participants were randomly divided into the control and intervention groups. Both groups
      walked for 30 minutes outdoors every day for maximum 70 days, and their blood pressure, pulse
      rate and blood oxygen saturation pre- and post-exercise were measured. Hourly ambient
      concentrations of air pollutants were collected. On days forecast with Air Quality Health
      Index was equal to or higher than 5, the intervention group was advised to exercise indoors.

      Background: The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a risk communication tool intended to
      provide information to the public on current and forecast air quality conditions. It was
      developed by the Canadian government to help the public make decisions to limit short-term
      exposure to air pollution and adjust their activity when air pollution levels are high,
      particularly for people who are sensitive to air pollution. Little research has been done to
      characterize the benefits of following AQHI advice. The AQHI is based on a weighted sum of
      concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter of median
      aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) to provide information to the public on current and
      forecasted air quality conditions.

      Objective: This study investigated whether patients with an implanted cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD) who followed advice to exercise indoors on high AQHI days had reduced
      adverse impacts on cardiovascular measures compared with those who exercised outdoors on
      those days.

      Methods: Participants with ICD were randomly divided into the control and intervention group.
      Both groups did daily 30-minute walked outdoors for maximum 70 days, and their data on blood
      pressure, pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation pre- and post-exercise were collected.
      Hourly ambient concentrations of PM2.5, O3, NO2, sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide
      (CO) were collected, and AQHI calculated. On days forecast with AQHI ≥5, the intervention
      group was advised to exercise indoors. Mixed-effects models were applied to analyze the
      associations between air pollution and cardiovascular measures.
