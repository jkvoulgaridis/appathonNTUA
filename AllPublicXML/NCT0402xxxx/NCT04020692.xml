  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the intervention of an operational clinical pharmacy team (EOPC),
      targeting both patients and hospital and health care professionals, allows: i) to initiate a
      therapeutic review during hospitalization, ii) to accompany the patients upon hospital
      discharge, iii) to maintain, in outpatient care, the drug treatments that have been optimized
      during hospitalization.

      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that the intervention of an EOPC in
      surgical departments and then in outpatient care makes it possible to maintain, 45 days after
      the discharge of the patients aged 65 years and over, the chronic outpatient treatments
      revised and optimized during the hospital stay.

      The secondary objectives are to measure the impacts of EOPC's intervention on:

        -  unexpected readmissions, emergency use, medical complications and adverse drug
           reactions;

        -  patient and health professional satisfactions (community pharmacists and physicians);

        -  the costs of drug treatments in ambulatory care.

    <intervention_model_description>The issue of drug continuity after hospital discharge has become a major issue in recent years. When patients return home, the drugs taken do not correspond to the treatments prescribed at the end of the hospitalization. This is due to appropriate or inappropriate initiatives of the patients (or their relatives) and/or the physicians accompanying them. Prescribed medications, on the other hand, are almost always dispensed by community pharmacists.

    <description>Patient At D0, the patient receives his discharge drugs prescription and benefits from a pharmaceutical counselling.
At D+3, he benefits from a telephone follow-up (good understanding of the methods of taking drugs, collection of difficulties).
Community pharmacist At D0, he receives the discharge drugs prescription. At D+3, he is contacted to collect information relating to drugs 'dispensation.
The attending physician At D0, he is informed of the patient's discharge and his drugs treatment
At D45, the data collection is based on telephone interviews [attending physician, pharmacist and patient (and if applicable the caregiver)].
It makes possible to collect drugs taken by the patient as well as significant events over the period (acute pathologies, re-hospitalizations, etc.).</description>
