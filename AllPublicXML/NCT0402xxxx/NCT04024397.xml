  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to better understand how people who are prescribed opioids for
      short-term use, go on to receive this type of medication on a longer-term basis.

      Identify incident cases of UPOU and prospectively assess their characteristics in comparison
      to new opioid users who do not progress to UPOU. At each site, opioid-naïve adults who
      receive opioid prescriptions will be enrolled. Opioid prescriptions (both written and filled)
      and self-reported opioid use will be followed, and those subjects progressing to UPOU will be
      identified in real time. Matched samples of patients who do and do not develop UPOU will be
      recruited for assessment of framework elements related to patient characteristics,including
      biochemical confirmation of opioid use, pain-related measures (including psychological
      variables), and medical and social histories. Using the information gathered in Aim 1,
      structural equation modeling will be utilized to evaluate the associations UPOU and the
      patient domain.

    <measure>Assess the rate of long-term opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>At month 6 following the receipt of the initial opioid prescription, the status of opioid use will be assessed to determine the rate of converting to long-term use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess patient factors associated with development of long-term opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient factors potentially associated development of long-term opioid use will be assessed including depressive symptoms as measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale. Scores on the scale range from 0 to 60 where higher scores indicated greater levels of depression. A cut-off score of 27 or greater indicates clinically significant levels of depression.</description>
