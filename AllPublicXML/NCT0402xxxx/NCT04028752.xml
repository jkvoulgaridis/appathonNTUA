  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposal contained herein seeks to examine the effect of simulated microgravity on
      important cell-cell interactions that govern vascular health. The interest lies in
      endothelial cell (EC) and macrophage cell interactions. The investigators are proposing to
      first understand how microgravity effects the macrophage and EC function or pro-healing
      capabilities. Next, the study team plans to develop a 3D tissue regeneration model in which
      macrophages and ECs are co-cultured in a hydrogel matrix. Utilizing this model, the team will
      assess how microgravity influenced macrophage-EC interactions in 3D. The investigators will
      assess EC tubule volume (or blood vessel development), macrophage spreading and the
      interactions with endothelial tubule sprouts. This model will serve as a critical foundation
      for future grant opportunities as it allows the assessment of tissue regeneration and
      vascular health in a 3D tissue microenvironment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While some knowledge has been gained with regards to macrophage alterations during space
      travel, most of this work has been limited to macrophage cell lines and has not considered
      how the effects of microgravity alter macrophages' ability to stimulate tissue repair and
      regeneration. Specifically, how the macrophage secretion profile and/or interaction with
      endothelial cells is altered during microgravity culture. Given the extensive data showing
      the consequence of simulated microgravity to alter endothelial cells, and the mounting
      evidence that simulated microgravity affects macrophage cells, the investigators hypothesize
      that microgravity alters the functional response of macrophages in close association with
      endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, the study team has established 2 specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Assess the effect of simulated microgravity on endothelial and macrophage
      pro-healing states.

      Specific Aim 2: Assess the effect of simulated microgravity on the pro-healing states of
      3-dimensional co-cultured macrophages and endothelial cells.

      Completion of the above described aims will lay a strong foundation of knowledge about the
      impact of simulated microgravity in important cell-cell interactions involved in tissue
      regeneration and healing

    <description>Isolation of circulating immune cells, termed macrophages from whole blood. The study team will isolate the macrophages that are contained within the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction (PBMNC). The investigators expect to isolate 800,000-3,200,000 PBMNC per ml of blood. The isolated cells will then be subject to culture in a simulated microgravity device.</description>
