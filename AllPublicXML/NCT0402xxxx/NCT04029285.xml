  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is debilitating and can lower the quality of life in older
      people. Therapeutic benefits have been reported from exergaming used as an intervention for
      rehabilitation or alternative to exercise. This study investigated the effects of exergaming
      in comparison with those of standard exercise on pain, postural control, technology
      acceptance and flow experience in older people with musculoskeletal pain.

      Study design: A prospective, randomized, controlled two-arm trial design: Group 1) exergaming
      with the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise System (IREX®) and Group 2) traditional
      gym-based exercise (TGB).

      Ethical Approval was sought from and granted by the School of Health and Social Care Research
      Governance and Ethics Committee at Teesside University on 20th September 2010 The study was
      conducted in the Physiotherapy Research Laboratory, Constantine Building, Teesside
      University.

      Participants were recruited by non-direct contacts from nine local community groups in the
      Middlesbrough area.

      Sixty-one potential participants were screened for eligibility. Four were excluded due to not
      meeting the eligibility criteria and three did not attend scheduled sessions. Fifty-four (42
      females and 12 males, age: 71 ± 5 years) were allocated to either exergaming with the IREX™
      (n = 27) or TGB (n = 27).

      Procedure

      On arrival for data collection at the Physiotherapy Research Laboratory at Teesside
      University, participants were asked if they had further questions about the study. These
      questions, if any, were answered. The study Consent Form was then signed. Participants'
      demographic details and all outcome measures were recorded, after which the participants were
      randomised by stratified blind-card allocation (picking a sealed opaque envelope).

      Data extraction

      Range and Standard Deviation (SD) of Centre of Pressure (CoP) displacements in the
      anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions (CoPAP SD, CoPAP range, CoPML SD,
      CoPML range - all mm) and the resultant CoP velocity (mm.sec-1) were extracted from the force
      platform using Bioware software (Kistler™), after low-pass filtering of the raw data at 10
      Hz. CoP velocity (mm.sec-1) was calculated.

      Statistical analysis

      Data was analysed with Version 19 of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS,
      Chicago, Illinois, USA). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess between-group
      final scores for each outcome measure used with baseline scores as covariate. Variables that
      did not meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance were analysed by two-way independent
      measures ANOVA with blocking using mean splits of scored pre-measures. Mixed analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) was used to determine any within-subject changes over time. All analyses
      used a significance level of 0.05. The effect size measure epsilon squared was used, where
      values of 0.01, 0.06 and 0.14 were interpreted as small, moderate and large.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score, on each cluster included in the Multi Affect and Pain Survey (MAPS) questionnaire (Clark, 2002).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in MAPS Cluster Score, from baseline to six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MAPS comprises three superclusters reflecting three major aspects of pain: somatosensory, emotional and well-being.
somatosensory supercluster contains 17 clusters with 57 descriptors of painful sensory qualities
emotional supercluster has 8 clusters with 26 descriptors of negative emotional qualities
well-being supercluster has 5 clusters with 18 descriptors of positive affect, and health.
Descriptors are presented as statements and participants rate how closely each comes to describing how they feel on a six point scale (from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much so)). Descriptor scores are summed to give Cluster scores. An increased score in somatosensory and emotional clusters reflects a worsening, in well-being it reflects an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in centre of pressure velocity (mm.s-1) (eyes open), from baseline to six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Centre of pressure velocity (mm.s-1) is the rate at which the centre point of force (measured on a Kistler™ Force Plate) moves, as the participant stands on the force plate with their eyes open.
It is quantified in mm.s-1 and an increase represents faster movements and hence more rapid corrections of balance are required to maintain equilibrium and hence postural control has worsened.</description>

    <description>Centre of pressure (CoP) is the centre point of force (measured on a Kistler™ Force Plate) as the participant stands on the force plate with their eyes open. The location of the CoP changes in the anterio-posterior direction (forwards to backwards) if the person sways forward and backward. The variability in the magnitude of sway is reflected in the Standard Deviation of this measure.
It is quantified in mm and an increased variation in movement means that more varied corrections of balance are required to maintain equilibrium and hence postural control has worsened.</description>

The extent of maximal and minimal magnitude of sway is reflected in the Range of this measure.
It is quantified in mm and an increase represents larger movements occurred and so correspondingly larger corrections of balance are required, to maintain equilibrium and hence postural control has worsened.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in score on each domain included in the Technology Acceptance: United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) questionnaire, from baseline to six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UTAUT comprises statements rated on a 7-point Likert scale, 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree, grouped into six domains.
performance expectancy, the belief that using a system will help improve performance,
effort expectancy, how easy it is to use the technology
social influence, how much the user believes others think they should use the technology
facilitation conditions, how much the user believes they should use the technology,
self-efficacy, how capable the user feel to use the technology
behavioural intention, intention to use the technology again.
Statement ratings are summed to give Domain scores. An increased score in any Domain reflects an increase in acceptance (positive outcome in respect of technology usage).</description>

    <description>The exergaming group played six IREX® exergames. Those in the TGB group performed exercises that were matched to the IREX® exergames for: movement patterns required, physiological demands, sequence, duration and mode of exercise by adopting open and closed kinetic chain movements, in the same range and loading, across both groups. Each IREX® exergame was played for two minutes and was repeated three times within a session. TGB exercise was conducted in sets of two minutes duration, repeated three times within a session. In both groups participants were given rest periods of 10 to 30 seconds, or longer, if required, between exergames or TGB exercise sets.</description>
