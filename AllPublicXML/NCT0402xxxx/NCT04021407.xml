  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, supraglottic airway devices are simple and effective alternatives to endotracheal
      intubation. Both laryngeal mask airway LMA and air-Q airway are supraglottic airway devices
      that can be used to maintain and protect airways from aspiration of secretions and blood
      during DCR surgery. The present study was designed to compare standard LMA versus air Q as
      regards the sealing effect and aspiration of blood in DCR surgery.

    <textblock>
      72 patients were divided into two groups, 36 patients each, named LMA group, and air Q group
      according to supraglottic devices used. The following parameters were recorded in both
      studied groups, continuous Electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate (HR), means arterial
      pressure (MAP), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), end tidal carbon di-oxide (PCO2)..Oro
      pharyngeal leak pressure in (cmH2O), exhaled tidal volume in (ml), leak volume in (ml), leak
      fraction in (%) number of shifting from LMA to air Q or ETT and shifting from air Q to LMA or
      ETT was recorded with absence or presence of surgical blood on The undersurface of the device
      used.
