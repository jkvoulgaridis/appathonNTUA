  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathing is impacted by obesity. Early changes are characterised by significant breathing
      abnormalities during sleep (a condition called sleep disordered breathing, the most common of
      which is obstructive sleep apnoea). As the breathing changes worsen in severity, it may
      result in a rise in carbon dioxide levels during daytime causing a condition called obesity
      hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The current treatment for obesity related breathing changes
      include supportive breathing therapy at night, optimisation of associated medical conditions
      and weight loss.

      Weight management is an important part of obesity treatment. Weight loss strategies such as
      life-style modification do not always work. Weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery) has been
      shown to be an effective weight management intervention with long-term results. This study
      aims to understand breathing changes that occurs due to obesity and their resolution after
      weight loss surgery. The investigators are aiming to recruit participants with sleep
      disordered breathing who are currently awaiting bariatric surgery. In particular, the
      investigators are interested in comparing breathing changes in participants with OHS, who
      have abnormal regulation of their carbon dioxide levels, and participants with sleep
      disordered breathing with normal CO2 regulation.

      Participants will be recruited through outpatient clinics for sleep disordered breathing. The
      participants will undergo comprehensive breathing assessments on enrolment including an
      overnight sleep study. Participants will undergo further daytime breathing assessments before
      and after their bariatric surgery. End of study will be 6 months after surgery - participants
      will have a final comprehensive breathing assessment including an overnight sleep study to
      review resolution of their breathing changes. Depending on the wait list time for the
      bariatric surgery, it is anticipated that participants will be enrolled in the study for 2
      years.
