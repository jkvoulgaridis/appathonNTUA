      Introduction

      The paravertebral catheter has been shown to be effective in controlling postoperative pain,
      but has never been associated with the deep dentate block in thoracic surgery. The objective
      of this study was to compare the efficacy of single-dose deep dentate block-level
      postoperative pain control in combination with a continuous perfusion paravertebral catheter
      versus continuous perfusion paravertebral catheter alone in controlled thoracic surgery.

      Materials and methods

      We retrospectively included 159 ASA I-III major patients who underwent scheduled thoracic
      surgery in the operating theater of Dijon University Hospital, between March and November
      2018. All patients benefited from the same anesthetic protocol routinely used in controlled
      thoracic surgery. They were included in two groups: deep serrate deep group (GS) with a deep
      serrated deep serrate block immediately after orotracheal intubation with 0.2% Ropivacaine at
      0.75 mg / kg and paravertebral catheter placed by the surgeon and put in charge at the fall
      of the surgical drapes versus control group (GC) benefiting from a paravertebral catheter
      alone. The primary endpoint was 24-hour morphine equivalent consumption. The criteria for
      secondary judgments were intraoperative remifentanil consumption, VAS at 0h, 24h and 48h,
      morphine consumption at 0h, 48h and the profile of the various complications. The morphine
      equivalent was calculated according to an equivalence table with reference to Oxycodone per
      os. Quantitative data are presented in median and standard deviation and were compared by
      Student's t-test or Wilcoxon test.
