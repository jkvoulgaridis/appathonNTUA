  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study where patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated
      with HF10 therapy for their chronic knee pain post-orthopedic surgery. The primary endpoint
      will be assessed at 3 months, but observational assessments will continue until study
      completion at 12 months following implant.

    <measure>Responders and Improvement in Oxford Knee Score (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OKS is a patient self-completion patient reported outcome containing 12 questions on activities of daily living with a recall period of 4 weeks. The OKS has been developed and validated specifically to assess function and pain after total knee replacement. The higher the score indicates improvement. The proportion of implanted subjects who are responders (achieved ≥ 50% pain relief) to HF10 therapy for treatment of their chronic, post-surgical knee pain or reporting at least a 4-point improvement in their Oxford Knee Score (OKS).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in pain experience: Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire version 2 (SF-MPQ-2, hereafter referred to as MPQ) is a well validated and widely used questionnaire used to measure the major symptoms of pain. Subjects will be asked to rate the intensity of each of 22 pain descriptors from 0 (do not experience, or none) to 10 (worst possible) at follow-up visits outlined in the schedule of events.
Four subscale scores (continuous pain, intermittent pain, predominantly neuropathic pain, and affective descriptors) and a total score will be calculated. The lower the score indicates improvement (less interference from pain). Each subject's baseline scores will be compared to the scores at study visits. Mean change from baseline will be calculated for the entire cohort.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as measured by the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) uses a 2-part assessment: a descriptive one and a visual analog scale. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The higher the score indicates an improved in quality of life.

    <measure>Change in Sleep as measured by the Pain and sleep Questionnaire (PSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSQ is an eight-item questionnaire developed to assess the impact of pain on sleep. PSQ-3 is a subset of PSQ, consisting of questions 1, 4 and 5 and has been validated to assess impact of chronic pain on sleep. The lower the score indicates improvement by less interference of sleep from pain. Change from baseline in 3-item pain and sleep questionnaire</description>

    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic status includes testing for gross motor, sensory and appropriate reflex functions, which will be characterized as improved, maintained, or a deficit as compared with baseline status as follows: A clinically meaningful neurological improvement is defined as a significant persistent improvement in neurological function that impacts subject's well-being is attributable to a neurological finding; and is new or improved as compared with the baseline assessment. A clinically meaningful neurological deficit is defined as a stimulation-related significant persistent abnormality in neurological function that impacts subject's well-being is attributable to a neurological finding; and is new or worsened as compared with the baseline assessment. If neither a clinically meaningful neurological improvement nor a clinically meaningful neurological deficit is observed, then neurologic status is maintained.</description>
