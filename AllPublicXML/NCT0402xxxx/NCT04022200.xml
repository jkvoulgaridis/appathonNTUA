  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-coating balloon (DCB) is a new interventional device for treatment of obstructive
      coronary artery disease (CAD). There is limited data on the long term efficacy and safety of
      DCB-only strategy for coronary de novo lesions in Asian patients. We therefore carry out this
      registry study to evaluated the clinical outcomes of paclitaxel DCB in Chinese patients in a
      real world medical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DCB has emerged as a new interventional option to treat obstructive CAD. Characterized by
      non-stent-based local drug delivery system, DCB has several advantages over drug-eluting
      stent(DES).Paclitaxel DCB inhibits excessive neointimal hyperplasia of a diseased lesions
      without leaving a permanent metallic frame, therefore reducing the risk of coronary
      thrombosis and eliminating adverse events associated with stent fracture, allergic reactions
      to metal struts or polymer. Since only 1 to 3 months duration of dual anti-platelet
      therapy(DAPT) is required after DCB intervention, the bleeding risk associated with prolonged
      DAPT is reduced. DCB angioplasty was proved safe in an all-comers, prospective, multicenter
      registry and confirmed not inferior to DES when treating small coronary lesions in a
      randomized clinical trial(BASKET SMALL-2). DCB has been used in&quot;off-label&quot;indications in
      the&quot;real world&quot; for de novo lesions, especially in vessels with diameter more than 2.75mm,
      and there is limited data on its long term clinical efficacy and safety in Asian patients in
      contemporary clinical registries. We therefore sought to evaluate the long term clinical
      outcome of DCB in treatment of coronary de novo lesions in Chinese patients.

    <description>The length of the DCB catheter should be chosen to exceed the target lesion for at least 2mm (at both proximal and distalends). The catheter(s) will be inflated for 30 to 60s with a minimum of 7 atm. Predilation of the diseased coronary segment with a uncoated balloon/scoring balloon/cutting balloon before the use of DCB will be encouraged. DES should be implanted if the angiographic result after DCB alone therapy is not satisfactory due to significant recoil/residual stenosis or dissection (Type C-F).</description>
