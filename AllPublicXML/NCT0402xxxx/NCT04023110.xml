  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of a risk-guided
      cardioprotective treatment strategy with carvedilol, as compared to usual care, in breast
      cancer patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin, trastuzumab, or the combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized clinical trial that seeks to determine if a risk guided
      treatment strategy that initiates carvedilol in high risk breast cancer patients prior to
      doxorubicin and/or trastuzumab is safe, tolerable, and feasible. Subjects who are identified
      as having elevated CTX Risk by an internally validated clinical risk score (exceeding a
      pre-specified risk threshold) will be randomized to individually-dosed, open-label carvedilol
      or usual care. Investigators will use a stratified randomization according to trastuzumab
      therapy (yes/no) to ensure balance across treatment regimen. Clinical, echocardiographic, and
      biomarker data will be collected on all patients at baseline and standardized time intervals
      during and after therapy at approximately 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months.
