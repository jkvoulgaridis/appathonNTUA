  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The age-related decline in muscle mass and strength is collectively referred to as
      sarcopenia. Canadian recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein intake (0.8 g/kg/d),
      however, many expert groups have advocated that older persons should increase their daily
      intake to ~1.2 g/kg/d to support the preservation of muscle mass. The use of plant-based
      proteins in food formulation has recently become of interest. This study will examine the
      impact of consuming higher- versus lower-quality protein supplements on muscle protein
      synthesis in healthy older men.

      This study will examine the impact of consuming higher- versus lower-quality protein
      supplements on the integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis in healthy older men.
      Briefly, participants will consume dietary protein at the RDA for the entire duration of the
      protocol (2 weeks). Participants will be randomized to consuming collagen (control - CON),
      whey (WHEY), or pea (PEA) protein supplements twice daily for one week. We will examine the
      ability of different qualities of protein supplements to stimulate integrated rates of muscle
      protein synthesis.

    <measure>Integrated Muscle Protein Synthesis</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days x 2</time_frame>
    <description>Integrated protein synthesis will be determined during 7 days of consuming the RDA of protein (control phase), and during 7 days of supplementation with a randomised protein supplement (Supplement phase).
Integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) will be determined using the D2O method. Briefly, 2H enrichment of saliva (precursor) and muscle (product) pools (relative to 1H) will be determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry and 'myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate' (%/day) determined.</description>

    <measure>Anabolic Signalling Proteins</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of each protein supplement on anabolic signalling proteins 1h post-ingestion.
Briefly, the phosphorylation status (activation) of anabolic signalling proteins will be determined by western blot analysis, and the fold change from that basal state will be presented.</description>
