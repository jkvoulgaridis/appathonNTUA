  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study objective is to test the Silk'n Toothwave self-selection, by potential end users.
      Additionally, this study will evaluate if contraindicated subjects will self-exclude from use
      of the device and the ability to understand accurately the labeling content (box and user
      manual).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Silk'n Toothwave Device, in its original packaging, along with the user manual will be
      provided to the patient in a simulated home use environment. The patient labeling will be in
      the format intended for distribution.

      All subjects will sign an informed consent before any study activity. Five (5) potential end
      users and Additional five (5) contraindicated subjects will be screened for this
      self-selection study. Subjects will be provided with the device in its original packaging and
      will be evaluated for their ability to decide if they are eligible or they should
      self-exclude themselves from use of the device based solely on reading the device labeling
      (box and user manual).

      Once the subjects complete reviewing the labeling materials (box and user manual) they will
      be requested to perform a labeling comprehension exam for testing the ability to correctly
      understand the labeling content.

      The study will not include treatment.
