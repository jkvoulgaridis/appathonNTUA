    <textblock>
      Randomized, open label study of intravenous terlipressin infusion vs. bolus for the treatment
      of variceal hemorrhage. 24 hour regimen consisting of intravenous terlipressin will be used
      either at a rate of 0.5mg/hour or 2mg bolus every 4 hourly. Participants will be randomized
      into intervention and control arm using block randomization by computer generated random
      numbers. Efficacy will be assessed by clinical improvement in symptoms and signs of GI bleed.
      To assess safety, frequency and degree of adverse reactions will be observed. Periodic
      assessments until 5 days will be done consisting of physical examination, safety assessments,
      vital signs and lab tests.

      Randomized, open label trial, conducted on patients admitted with acute variceal hemorrhage
      at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi (AKUH). Patients will be followed in clinic
      after discharge to assess survival for 6 weeks.

      Intravenous terlipressin will be obtained from Clinical Trials Unit, AKUH pharmacy in
      standard IV infusion form. Following complete clinical and laboratory evaluation, assessing
      the patient for eligibility, informed consent will be obtained from all the participants who
      are willing to be part of this study. After obtaining the informed consent, study
      participants will be randomized into the intervention arm (continuous infusion of
      Terlipressin) or the control arm (bolus form of Terlipressin). Participants who are
      randomized to the intervention arm will be administered a continuous infusion of Terlipressin
      at a rate of 0.5mg/hour for the first 24 hours. Participants randomized into the control
      group will be administered a bolus form of Terlipressin at a rate of 2mg every six hourly for
      the first 24 hours respectively. In case of weekends/public holidays intravenous terlipressin
      will be obtained from the main pharmacy of AKUH.

      The trial will be conducted in in-patient units of AKUH where eligible patients are admitted.
      It may include emergency room, special care unit and general ward. Moreover, patients will be
      followed up by phone calls and in outpatient's clinics to assess survival six weeks post
      discharge.
