      This study evaluates the effectiveness of individualized human milk fortification for very
      low birth weight (&lt;1500 g) babies in the NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) to optimize
      their growth. Breast milk analysis will occur on a weekly basis using the Miris Human Milk
      Analyzer. In the Control group, participants will receive standard TPN (total parenteral
      nutrition) and lipids and breast milk fortification according to MetroHealth's NICU
      guidelines. The Intervention group will receive TPN and lipids optimized depending on the
      results of breast milk analysis, followed by additional individualized fortification using
      additional microlipids and/or liquid protein to achieve the goal of 4g protein/kg/day and
      100-130 kcal/kg/day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human milk has a variety of benefits for neonates, especially premature neonates, including a
      decreased risk of for necrotizing enterocolitis, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, respiratory infections, and many other
      childhood conditions. There is variability in macronutrient and caloric content of breast
      milk between mothers, making it difficult to accurately quantify the nutritional content the
      breast milk is providing. The protein content varies by postnatal age, and the fat content
      varies temporally during a feed. Currently calculations use a standard value for caloric
      density and macronutrient content of breast milk, which is a reported average, but not
      necessarily specific to each individual mother. Human milk analysis has been used to address
      this variability. The Miris Human Milk Analyzer (HMA) is a mid-infrared analyzer and has been
      evaluated in many studies. It measures the macronutrient content of breast milk, providing
      values for protein, fat, carbohydrates, and calculated calories. By having this information
      available, the fortification added to breast milk can be tailored specifically to each
      mother's breast milk composition to meet each neonate's nutritional needs, and optimize
      growth.This will be a prospective randomized control study of preterm infants less than 1500
      grams [very low birth weight (VLBW)] receiving human milk (maternal or donor) will be
      included. The control group will receive adjustment of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) per
      NICU guidelines as enteral feedings are advanced followed by standard fortification of human
      milk. The intervention group will have TPN (protein and lipids) adjusted based on analysis of
      human milk as feedings are advanced to provide goal 4g/kg/day of protein and 100-130
      kcal/kg/day followed by targeted fortification of breast milk based on human milk analysis to
      continue to provide 4 g/kg/day of protein and 100-130 kcal/kg/day for once full feeds are
      achieved. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the growth, anthropometric
      measurements, and body composition, to see if targeted fortification improves neonatal
      growth. By optimizing neonatal growth and nutrition there is potential to also have an impact
      on other morbidities and long term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a randomized control trial with 2 arms: control group (standard fortification) or intervention group (targeted fortification) in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Allocation group will be stratified to four groups according to birth weight: &lt;750g, 751-1000g, 1001-1250g, 1251-1500g. This stratification is based upon our NICU feeding guideline, and will ensure that enrolled infants will receive comparable nutrition progression (e.g. NPO (nil per os) days, days of trophic feeds) throughout the study period. The allocation will be concealed in a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope, that will be opened after consent is obtained.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Body composition will be measured by air displacement plethysmography (PEAPod). As standardized assessment of body composition is relatively new in the preterm infant population, we are using clinical judgment to determine that a difference in fat free mass z-score (from data from Norris T, 2019) of 0.5 is clinically significant.</description>

50 ml breast milk at 50ml/kg/day enteral feeds, then 1 packet:25 ml breast milk at 75 ml/kg/day. During this time, as the volume decreases, the TPN and SMOF lipids will be optimized to provide a goal of 4 g/kg/day of protein, and 100-130kcal/kg/day. At 100 ml/kg/day of enteral feeds additional liquid protein and/or microlipids will be added to the breast milk to provide goal of 4 g/kg/day of protein and 100-130 kcal/kg/day. This will be determined by analysis of the milk and reported composition. They will continue targeted fortification for 4 weeks after achieving full feeds of 150 ml/kg/day. Breast milk analysis will occur on a weekly basis immediately after birth for all infants enrolled in the study.</description>
