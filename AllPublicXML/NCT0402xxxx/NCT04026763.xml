  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if targeted (Magnetic Resonance (MR) / Ultrasound (US) fusion
      biopsy) plus conventional biopsy is superior to conventional biopsy alone in diagnosing
      subjects with prostate cancer.

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of targeting lesions for surgery may be limited by the visibility of a target
      during the procedure. The successful outcome of surgical intervention depends upon accurate
      device placement, which may be very challenging in certain settings, such as when a kidney
      tumor only is visible for a brief moment during the transient arterial phase of a contrast
      injection, and soon disappearing on dynamic imaging.

      Historically, prostate cancer was diagnosed by digitally guided trans-rectal prostate
      biopsies. With PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) screening and improvements in ultrasonography,
      trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy have become the standard of care to
      screen and diagnose localized prostate cancer. Standard US 12-14 core prostate biopsy is now
      common practice, detecting cancer in 27% to 44% of patients.

      Prostate MR imaging at 3 Tesla magnet dramatically improves diagnostic utility dramatically
      but biopsies are difficult, time-consuming, and require specialized equipment, which
      increases the cost significantly.

      To meet this challenge TRUS images are overlaid on a previously obtained prostate MRI,
      combined with an electromagnetic tracking system. The urologist then performs directed
      prostate biopsies at MR-identified targets in addition to the standard prostate biopsies.

      This study will consist of comparison of the standard of care prostate biopsy with the
      protocol biopsy which consists of a US guided prostate biopsy and a MR/US fusion tracked
      prostate biopsy. Each patient will act as their own control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a pre-operative MRI performed in accordance with the MT
             Sinai/NIH MR prostate imaging guidelines.

          -  Age greater than 18 years.
