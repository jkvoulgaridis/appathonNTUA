      A proof-of-concept (POC) proposal to study the feasibility of customized head protection
      prototype device (HPPD) using 3D printed externally-applied moulded skin prosthesis
      integrated to the craniectomy bony skull defect. The proposed material is a bio-compatible,
      light-weight rigid /semi rigid material which can be fitted to the skull defect and
      interfaced with the subject's bony rim using soft, deformable material (e.g. silicon) and
      attached using an elastic head band or other acceptable means. The prosthesis is removable
      for skin and prosthesis cleansing and ventilation.

      Study Specific Objectives:

      (i) Primary Objectives

      These are to:

        1. test the feasibility and safety of customised 3D printed HPPD,

        2. integrate the prostheses to the skull defect in removable manner and discharge patient
           with appropriate education,

        3. to systematically monitor subjects for symptoms, compliance, complications and
           subjective feedback during the outpatient phase where progressive wear of HPPD and
           monitoring of acceptability will be monitored.

        All subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.

          1. Age 21 to 80 years, both males and females.

          2. Presence of surgical unilateral or bilateral craniectomy performed for reasons of
             ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain
             injury (TBI), benign cerebral tumours, etc.

          3. Stroke, SAH or TBI are diagnosed by specialists and confirmed on brain imaging studies
             (CT, MRI)

          4. Duration from event &gt; 30 days and either during inpatient or outpatient phase.

          5. Presence of at least 1 post decompressive craniectomy CT brain film performed at
             NNI/TTSH.

          6. Healed craniectomy surgical wound without bulging skin flap or active skin infection.

          7. Patients awaiting elective cranioplasty or those who refuse cranioplasty. 8 Ability to
             understand simple instructions and give own consent. 9 Presence of family members or
             NOK who can supervise the patient to don the head protection device, care for the
             material and regularly monitor for compliance and complications 10 Reproductive age
             females should not be pregnant at the point of consent-taking and during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient in vegetative or minimally responsive state.

          2. Presence of uncontrolled medical condition (uncontrolled hypertension, Diabetes
