        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males aged 20 to 55 years (both inclusive) at signature of the Informed
             Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Able to provide written informed consent to participate in this study after reading
             the ICF, and after having the opportunity to discuss the study with the Investigator
             or designee, before any screening or study related procedures take place.

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, subject is able to understand the nature of the study
             and any risks involved in participation, and willing to cooperate and comply with the
             protocol restrictions and requirements.

          -  A body weight of ≥45 kg and a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 18 to 30 kg/m2 (both
             inclusive) at screening and Day -1.

          -  Good health and free from clinically significant illness or disease in the opinion of
             the investigator on the basis of a physical examination, medical history, ECG, vital
             sign, and clinical laboratory test (biochemistry, hematology, coagulation and
             urinalysis) at screening and Day -1.

          -  Male subjects must practice effective contraception during the study, from the time of
             the first dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) until 14 days after the last
             dose of IMP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with PR &gt;240 msec, QRS ≥120 msec, or QTcF &gt;450 msec on the screening or Day
             -1 ECG, or any clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormality in the opinion
             of the Investigator.

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody or syphilis test at screening.

          -  Participation in another trial within 12 weeks or 5 times the half-life of the drug
             whichever is longer before providing a signed ICF. For biologics, the minimum period
             is at least 24 weeks or the period of the pharmacodynamic effect, or 10 times the
             half-life of the drug, whichever is longer before providing a signed ICF.

          -  Donate blood more than 200 mL within 4 weeks, 400 mL within 12 weeks or 1000 mL within
             52 weeks, respectively before providing a signed ICF.

          -  Donate plasma or platelet component within 2 weeks before providing a signed ICF.

          -  Use of any prescription or non-prescription medications including herbal remedies and
             vitamin/mineral/protein supplements, except for acetylsalicylic acid, within 7 days
             prior to IMPs dosing.

          -  Use of tobacco or nicotine containing products for 24 hours before each visit of
             screening or Day -1.

          -  Consumption of alcohol, xanthines, or grapefruit containing products for 24 hours
             before each visit of screening or Day -1.
