  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma-related deaths are more numerous among low-income minority patients and older adults
      with chronic diseases. Guidelines for asthma management have not addressed the needs of these
      groups. The investigators recently demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and evidence
      of effectiveness of two interventions to improve access to care, patient-provider
      communication, and asthma outcomes: 1) CI: clinic intervention using a patient advocate to
      prepare for, attend, and confirm understanding of an office visit, and 2) HV: home visits for
      care coordination and informing clinicians of home barriers to managing asthma is associated
      with subsequent improvement in asthma outcomes. This project explores whether these
      interventions can be combined for greater effectiveness, delivery of guideline-based asthma
      care, and outcomes in low-income minority patients.

      In a randomized controlled factorial trial, 400 adults with uncontrolled asthma living in
      low-income urban neighborhoods are offered 18-months' participation: 12 months of clinical
      intervention and 6 months of evaluation to monitor sustainability of interventions and
      outcomes. Patients will be randomized to 1) a patient advocate and (2) an advocate and home
      visits, (3) an advocate and real-time feedback to the asthma provider (clinician) at each
      clinic visit of guidelines-relevant relevant information, and 4) (2), and (3). Interventions
      will be delivered by a community health worker. The study estimates Specific Aim 1:
      improvement over time of within-group (before-after in four groups) asthma outcomes (asthma
      control, quality of life, ED visits, hospitalizations, prednisone bursts) Specific Aim 2:
      across group differences in improvement over time in asthma outcomes; Specific Aim 3: the
      costs associated with each of the interventions. A cost-offset analysis will determine which
      intervention costs are offset by savings attributable to reductions in ED, hospitalization or
      other visits for asthma control and other outcomes.

      Exploratory Aim: changes in behavior from the interventions using interviews of clinicians
      and patients.

      Investigators hypothesize that improved outcomes in asthma patients will result from enhanced
      patient-clinician communication, clinician attention to home environmental exposures, and
      clinician consideration of the guidelines, at a program cost offset by lower patient health
      care utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, a chronic but treatable disease, affects 18.7 million US adults. Asthma-related
      deaths, hospitalizations, and ED visits are more prevalent in low-income and minority
      patients, especially African Americans and particularly among older adults, many with
      co-morbidities.

      The Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR3) Guidelines for Asthma Diagnosis and Management, currently
      undergoing revision, is primarily directed at children and young adults. It overlooks older
      patients, many with comorbidities and many who live in poverty. Action plans are infrequently
      used and their benefits, strongly recommended by guidelines, have not been evaluated in older
      or low-income minority adults. Regular use of inhaled steroids, endorsed by the Guidelines
      for all but the mildest asthma is limited by social and economic barriers, e.g. cost and
      accessibility of medication. Failure of guidelines to address the barriers of poverty,
      limited education, poor housing and communication infrastructure, and suboptimal public
      transportation may promote non-adherence by clinicians.

      For these vulnerable adults, the investigators recently demonstrated the feasibility,
      acceptability, and evidence of effectiveness of two separate interventions to improve access
      to care, patient-provider communication, and asthma outcomes: 1) a patient advocate (PA)
      (HAP2 Study (R18 HL116285)) to prepare for, attend, and confirm understanding of an office
      visit, and 2) community health workers (CHWs) (ARC Study (PCORI AS 1307-05218)) to assess
      home barriers to asthma management and coordinate care between home and clinic. Both
      protocols, well-accepted by patients and clinicians, allow prompting, delivery, and testing
      of guideline recommendations in a tailored real-world setting. Although these studies were
      designed and initiated separately, patient advocates in the clinic-based study felt that
      understanding the home circumstances would be beneficial to clinicians making guideline-based
      recommendations, while the CHWs visiting homes in the second study wanted more communication
      with treating clinicians. The proposed project combines these interventions by offering all
      &quot;PA activities&quot;, called the Clinic Intervention (CI) and randomizing half to Home Visits
      (HV). Additionally, in a factorial design half of patients will be randomized to have their
      clinician receive feedback on guideline-relevant domains recommended for discussion with
      patients at appointments. The proposed interventions facilitate communication between
      clinicians and patients, enriched by understanding of the home environment, the unique view
      of the patient-clinician interaction at appointments, and barriers to asthma management that
      patients encounter. While the communication focuses on asthma management, it extends to
      general care coordination of common co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity
      and patients will be recruited from both primary care and specialty practices. Community
      Health Navigators (CHNs), who are lay health workers, will deliver the CI in all patients and
      the HVs in those so randomized. CHNs with close ties to patients' neighborhoods and also
      embedded in the clinics, will ensure patients' voices are heard in the delivery of
      guideline-based care and support patients at risk for health disparities, e. g., older
      adults, those with comorbidities, low income or limited literacy.

      In a randomized controlled factorial trial, adults with uncontrolled asthma living in
      low-income urban neighborhoods will be offered 18-months participation in four groups of 100
      each (1) CI only, (2) CI plus Home Visits (HV), (3) CI and clinician feedback, and (4) CI +
      HV + clinician feedback. Patients will be evaluated quarterly for 12 months and then observed
      for 6 months to assess sustainability of the intervention. The investigators will estimate:

      Specific Aim 1: improvement over time of within-group (before-after in four groups) asthma
      outcomes (asthma control, quality of life, ED visits, hospitalizations, prednisone bursts)
      Specific Aim 2: across group differences in improvement over time in asthma outcomes;
      Specific Aim 3: the costs associated with each of the intervention, and the investigators
      will conduct a cost-offset analysis to determine which intervention costs are offset by
      savings attributable to reductions in ED, hospitalizations or other visits for asthma control
      and other outcomes.

      Exploratory Aim: changes in behavior from the interventions using interviews of clinicians
      and patients.

      Hypothesis and Impact: The investigators hypothesize improved outcomes in asthma patients
      through enhanced communication of patient and clinician, clinician attention to home
      environmental exposure, and clinician consideration of the guidelines, at a program cost
      offset by lower patient health care utilization.

    <intervention_model_description>All patients will receive the clinical intervention (CI). In a 2-factor, 2-level factorial design, patients will be randomized to one of four groups by home visitor (HV) and/or physician feedback(CF) intervention: CI + HV, CI + CF, CI + HV + CF, CI. Well-suited for the investigation of the separate components of an intervention, a factorial design permits simple and powerful comparisons between the two factors (home visitor (HV) and clinician feedback CF), cell specific contrasts (the addition of home visitors among patients who have no physician feedback), and the interaction of both interventions. Each patient will be followed over time, so that the additional power of the factorial design will complement the confounder control inherent in randomization plus longitudinal analysis.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male &gt; 18 years and living in a Philadelphia neighborhood in which at least
             20% of households have incomes below the federal poverty level (19104, 19120, 19121,
             19122, 19124, 19125, 19131, 19132, 19133, 19134, 19139, 19140, 19141, 19142, 19143,
             19144, 19145, 19146, 19153, 19151)

          -  A patient in a participating clinic

          -  Doctor's diagnosis of asthma

          -  Prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma

          -  Required prednisone or an Emergency Department (ED) visit or hospitalization for
             asthma within 12 months before enrollment.

               -  Some patients with a diagnosis of asthma and prescribed inhaled corticosteroid
                  may also have mention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in their
                  record, particularly if they smoke. Asthma and COPD are both heterogeneous
                  diseases, and may be impossible to distinguish by clinical characteristics.Both
                  COPD and asthma can have evidence of reversible obstruction and also of
                  irreversible obstruction. It is important not to exclude these patients,
                  sometimes called overlap patients as they may benefit from these interventions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe psychiatric or cognitive problems making it impossible to understand or carry
             out the protocol;

          -  Excluded are those with other chronic lung diseases: lung cancer, cystic fibrosis,
             heart failure, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary hypertension, a candidate or recipient
             for lung transplant, a history of bronchial thermoplasty.
