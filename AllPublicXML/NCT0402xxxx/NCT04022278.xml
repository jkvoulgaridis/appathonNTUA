  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea syndrome has an estimated incidence of 2 to 4% in the adult population and more
      so in men and with aging. It is an independent risk factor for mortality. Cardiovascular
      pathologies, diabetes, and stroke are known comorbidities with a high rate of association.
      There is no recommendation to screen these patients although the interest is assumed and
      sleep apnea syndrome is largely underdiagnosed. Interrogation and clinical examination guide
      but they are neither sensitive nor specific. The use of scores improves screening. In the
      general population, the Berlin score has a high false negative rate. The STOP-BANG score is
      sensitive but with a poor positive predictive value. Combined, these scores can be used to
      detect Sleep Apnea Syndrome. The interest of a management was especially shown for the very
      symptomatic syndromes because it is a pledge of observance of the treatment, itself necessary
      for the effectiveness in the prevention of the cardiovascular complications.
