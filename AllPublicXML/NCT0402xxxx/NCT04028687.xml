    <textblock>
      The objective of this consecutive series PMCF study is to collect data confirming safety,
      performance, and clinical benefits of the Taperloc Complete stems when used for primary or
      revision total hip arthroplasty (implants) at 1,3,5,7 and 10-year follow-up*. Since Taperloc
      Complete was introduced to the EU in 2010, all available retrospective data will be collected
      from each patient and a prospective aspect to the study will be necessary to reach the
      10-year time point.

      The objective of this consecutive series PMCF study is to collect data confirming safety,
      performance, and clinical benefits of the Taperloc Complete stems when used for primary or
      revision total hip arthroplasty (implants) at 1,3,5,7 and 10-year follow-up*. Since Taperloc
      Complete was introduced to the EU in 2010, all available retrospective data will be collected
      from each patient and a prospective aspect to the study will be necessary to reach the
      10-year time point.

      The primary objective is to confirm safety of the study products. This will be assessed by
      recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.
      Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by analyzing
      recorded patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

      *The most recent available data will be used. If any of the listed time points are not
      available, data will be used from last available time point and follow-up will move forward
      at the closest available time point

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Performance and Benefits evaluated through the Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Out to 10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The HHS is divided into 4 sub-categories; pain (44 points), function (47 points), range of motion (5 points), and absence of deformity (4 points). Patients select a discrete set of answers which correspond to predefined point allocations based on the category. To obtain a final score, these values are summed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Performance and Benefits evaluated through the Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Out to 10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The OHS is a patient-completed, 12-question evaluation. Each item is scored from 1 to 5, with 1 representing best outcome/least symptoms and 5 representing worst outcome/most symptoms.</description>
