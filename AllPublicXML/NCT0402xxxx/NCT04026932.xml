  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective Tinnitus is one of the most common acoustic disorders by affecting 5-43% people
      around the world, and tinnitus is harmful to social and individuals, inducing to annoyance,
      irritability, anxiety, depression, insomnia and concentration difficulties. Many efforts have
      been made to help tinnitus suffers, however, the curative means are still in absence. This
      study aims to introduce a novel sound therapy for tinnitus and to evaluate the efficacy of
      modified tinnitus relieving sound treatment in comparison with unmodified music which served
      as a control.

      Methods and analysis A randomized, triple-blinded, controlled, clinical trial will be carried
      out. 68 patients with subjective tinnitus will be recruited and randomized into two groups in
      1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes will be Tinnitus Handicapped Inventory (THI), Hospital
      Anxiety and Distress Scale (HADS), and visual analogue scale (VAS) for tinnitus; the
      secondary outcome measures will be Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), tinnitus loudness matched by
      sensation level (LM, SL), and minimum masking level (MML). Assessment will be performed at
      baseline and at 1, 3, 9, and 12 months post-randomization. The sound stimulus will be
      persistent until 9 months after randomization, and be interdictory in the last three months.
