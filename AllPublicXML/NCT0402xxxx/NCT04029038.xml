      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of modified immune cells called
      CD19-CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in treating patients with CD19 positive(+),
      CD22+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). T-cells are
      collected from the patient and genetic materials called &quot;chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)&quot;
      are transferred to the collected T-cells. The CAR T-cells are then infused back to the
      patient's body. Giving CD19- CD22 CAR T cells after chemotherapy may help to control the
      disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of infusion with chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD19
      and CD22.

      II. To find the recommended phase II dose for recurrent/refractory CD19+CD22+ B cell
      malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the overall response rate and complete response rate of relapsed B cell
      malignancies treated with CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD22.

      II. To assess other response variables including minimal residual disease (MRD) negative
      remission, overall survival (OS), and event free survival (EFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune reconstitution and persistence of CAR T cells for one year post
      infusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of autologous CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen
      receptor T-cells (CD19-CD22 CAR T cells) followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive standard of care cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5, -4, and -3, and then receive CD19-CD22 CAR T cells
      IV on day 0. Patients with relapsed or persistent disease after a protocol assessment may
      receive a second infusion of CD19-CD22 CAR T cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months.

    <description>Toxicity is defined as a grade 3, 4, or 5 cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0 with onset within 30 days of cell infusion. Adverse events that are considered disease-related (not suspected of relationship to CD19-CD22 -CAR T cells) will not be considered dose-limiting toxicities. Only those AEs that occur during the first 30 days after infusion, which are suspected to be related to conditioning lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen and/or CD19 -CD22-CAR T cells (any component of the treatment regimen), and meet the following criteria, will be used in the definition of toxicity. Hematologic toxicities will not be considered in the definition of toxicity, as pancytopenia is a common toxicity with this regimen.</description>
