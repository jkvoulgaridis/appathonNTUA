  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Because of the
      poor treatment effect in advanced patients, it is still the main cause of maintenance
      dialysis. Current immunosuppressive therapy is still controversial, especially to those
      progressive IgA nephropathy with eGFR&lt;50ml/min. Leflunomide is widely used in the treatment
      of rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus nephritis, it's serum
      concentration will not be affected by renal function, and it also has antiviral effect. There
      are two randomized controlled trials and a retrospective study suggesting that leflunomide
      combined with glucocorticoids can effectively control urinary protein compared with
      glucocorticoids or conservative treatment, but these three studies are not specifically
      targeted at patients with estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR) &lt; 50ml/min.

      Investigators will perform a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of leflunomide and low dose glucocorticoids therapy in
      progressive IgA nephropathy with eGFR&lt;50ml/min

      all the participants enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, the
      experimental group will receive leflunomide + low dose glucocorticoids therapy on the basis
      of conservative treatment, while the control group receive conservative treatment only.
      Conservative treatment is defined as the treatment of delaying the progress of renal
      function, including low-protein diet supplemented with ketoacid therapy, Renin Angiotensin
      system (RAS) inhibitor, blood pressure control, lipid-regulating therapy and antiplatelet
      aggregation therapy. The course of treatment will last one year, then the
      leflunomide+glucocorticoids group will continue the conservative treatment. Participants will
      be follow-up at least 98 weeks.
