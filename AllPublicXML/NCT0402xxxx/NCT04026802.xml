  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to decrease deconditioning of elderly inpatients in acute care
      institutions and to assess the safety and feasibility of a newly developed resistance
      training device. Investigators believe this device will help hospitalized seniors maintain
      their independence by preventing the loss of functionality from deconditioning and improve
      value of care through decreased length of stay and utilization of care. Current therapy will
      be complemented with a new in--bed resistance training device to target weak elderly patients
      and standardize progressive resistance training in facilities.

    <measure>AMPAC 6 Clicks Composite PT (range 11-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The AM - PAC measures 3 functional domains: basic mobility, daily activities and applied cognition . It may be used for assessment in adults with a wide range of diagnoses and levels of performance in the 3 domains . The '6 - Clicks' instruments may have advantages over the instruments previously developed for the acute care setting in that they are simple and quick to complete, provide a transparent measure of patients' capabilities in functional areas important for prioritization of therapy resources , and use Item Response Theory to derive a common metric that can be linked with other short forms derived from the AM - PAC instrument.</description>

    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 points above or below 50, corresponds to one standard deviation away from the average.</description>

    <description>The present invention provides full body resistance training devices that attach to a planar edge, such as a footboard, headboard, or sideboard of a bed. The devices employ resistance bands for resistance training in both the incursion (force applying) and excursion (force releasing) phase of exercise.</description>
