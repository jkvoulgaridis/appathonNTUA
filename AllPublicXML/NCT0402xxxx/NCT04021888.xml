  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to investigate the feasibility of an exercise program
      consisting of respiratory exercises, aerobic exercises and strengthening exercises in mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease. The trial also aims to investigate the effectiveness of the
      exercise program on respiratory symptoms, exercise capacity, cognition, physical performance,
      depression, sleepiness, activities of daily living and quality of life.

      Patients will be divided into exercise (intervention) and control group by randomization
      method. The study is planned to be performed with a total of 60 patients, 30 in each group.
      The patients in the exercise group will be given breathing exercises aerobic exercises and
      strengthening exercises for 2 days a week for 12 weeks, about 30-40 minutes while the
      patients in the control group will be provided with suggestions, home exercise program and
      daily life activities

    <measure>Change in cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is used to measure cognitive impairment in older adults. It assesses different subset of cognitive status including attention, language, memory, orientation, visuospatial proficiency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pulmonary functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function test (PFT) is a generic term used to indicate a battery of studies or maneuvers that may be performed using standardized equipment to measure lung function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of respiratory muscle strength is useful in order to detect respiratory muscle weakness and to quantify its severity. Respiratory muscle strength is assessed by mouth pressures sustained for 1 s during maximal static manoeuvre against a closed shutter</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a valid, reliable and useful test for assessing functional capacity of COPD patients. This test assesses distance walked over 6 minutes as a sub maximal test of aerobic capacity/endurance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests. It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is a questionnaire that's routinely used to assess daytime sleepiness. The person filling in the questionnaire rates how likely they are to doze off during the day in different situations.
Patients scored eight questions according to the probability of sleeping 0, 1, 2, 3, and the sum of the eight questions was calculated. A high score indicates sleepiness. If the total score is greater than 10, it indicates the presence of pathological sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease-Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), is consist of 13-item self-report and 13- item caregiver-report measures. Each item is evaluated on a 4-point scale (1 point is bad and 4 points is excellent)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) measures functional disability by quantifying patient performance in 10 activities of daily life. These activities can be grouped according to self-care (feeding, grooming, bathing, dressing, bowel and bladder care, and toilet use) and mobility (ambulation, transfers, and stair climbing). Points are given according to doing daily life activities dependently or independently. It ranges from 0 to 100 and 0 points refers to complete dependence, 100 points refers to independence The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale assesses a person's ability to perform tasks such as using a telephone, doing laundry, and handling finance. This scale consist of 8 question. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-SF) is an instrument that was developed to assess depressive symptoms and screen for depression among older people. It can be selfadministered or presented as an interview, and the questions have a yes/no format in order to be easy to understand for older people who may suffer from impaired cognitive function.
This scale has 15 questions. In the assessment of the scale, no to positive questions and yes to negative questions were matched with 1 point and total score of 6 and above was considered significant for depressive symptoms.</description>
