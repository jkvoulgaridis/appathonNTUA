  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure have decreased exercise tolerance, balance problems, and fall
      risks. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of an exercise program
      based on the Empowerment Model for participants with heart failure. This randomized,
      controlled study including pre-test/post-test and the measurements were performed between
      January-November 2014 at a university hospital in Izmir, Turkey. Intervention group (n = 11)
      and control group (n = 10) participated in the research. The intervention group received
      45-60 minute individual training and 12 weeks of individual follow-up. The weekly
      motivational phone calls structured according to the empowerment model and home visits when
      necessary were repeated. Patients in the control group did not receive any intervention
      except for their routine treatment. Data were collected before the education of exercise and
      after 12 weeks; sociodemographic data questionnaire, pedometer, accelerometer, Berg Balance
      Scale, HF Empowerment Scale, estimated weekly exercise monitoring form and exercise booklet
      had been utilised. The SPSS statistical package program was used to analyze the data.

    <description>Old patients were observed and evaluated daily activities during 12 weeks. The exercise program was established on evidence-based recommendations for patients with Heart Failure (HF). Empowerment level of individuals before and after exercise program were evaluated. Empowerment is a model aiming to protect patients' rights and develop the quality of care. This model is aimed at giving individuals a feeling of success and improving their self image, and is intended to make necessary lifestyle changes easier and more lasting. Subscales of the empowerment are &quot;Managing the Psychosocial Aspects of Heart Failure&quot;, &quot;Assessing Dissatisfaction and Readiness to Change&quot; and &quot;Setting and Achieving Heart Failure Goals&quot;. The Scale evaluated has 28 items and five-way likert-type. Scores range from 28 to 140, scores of 28-65 classified as low, 66-103 as medium, and 104-140 as high.</description>

    <description>The intervention group received 45-60 minute of individual training and a handbook for the exercise program was given. These patients were followed for a total of 12 weeks. The exercise program was developed by reviewing the literature part on physical activity for senior citizens with heart failure. Education program based on Empowerment model. Weekly motivational telephone interviews were conducted with the patients, and the home visits and telephone interviews were repeated when belived necessary. The purpose of the study were explained to all individuals involved in the study. Body movements, balance levels, exercise durations, and strengths of individuals before exercise program and after exercise program were evaluated. A booklet demonstrating the exercises was given to the patients to enhance their understanding, and they were allowed to ask questions about the exercise program during the training.</description>
