      This research investigates the effect of two physiotherapy models in the treatment of chronic
      nonspecific low back pain. Participants will be divided into three groups, two experimental
      and one control. In both experimental groups, the participants will be included in the
      intensive program of therapeutic exercises, under the supervision and guidance of the
      physiotherapist, and the group will differ in that a group of cognitive-behavioral therapies
      will be implemented by a physiotherapist, operative conditioning. In the control group,
      subjects will recive the usual treatment. The Back school will be applied in all groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a global public health problem, one of the main causes of disability of the
      population, as well as enormous economic costs in the health system. This claim specifically
      relates to chronic low back pain. The clinical picture of chronic low back pain in addition
      to pain, muscle spasm and functional disability dominate psychological problems, which
      significantly affects the outcome of treatment. The multidisciplinary approach to treatment
      of chronic low back pain has proven to be the most effective, bad economically unacceptable
      and unavailable in many countries. Therefore, it is necessary to find the most effective and
      economically most acceptable approach to treatment of chronic low back pain. Physiotherapy is
      an unavoidable method of treating this painful condition, and changes in treatment approach
      are most evident in this medical profession. Recently, physiotherapy includes two models in
      the treatment chronic low back pain. Biomedical model consisting of well-known physiotherapy
      methods and a Biopsychosocial model that, in addition to known physiotherapy methods,
      includes a part of cognitive-behavioral therapy associated with motion and behavior,
      operative conditioning. Therapeutic exercise as a effective method indispensable part in both
      models of physiotherapy.

      The reason of changes in physiotherapy is a varied clinical picture of chronic low back pain.
      The proven effect of therapeutic exercises has been determined to reduce the body's symptoms,
      pain and functional disabilities. The effect of reducing psychological symptoms has been
      poorly investigated. Also, the use of therapeutic exercises in the practice creates a number
      of concerns related to the intensity of exercise, mode and time-frame of their application,
      and the type or method of exercise.

      Because it's already a known effect operant conditioning through a multidisciplinary approach
      to reducing the psychological symptoms of chronic low back pain, it is suggested that this
      part of cognitive behavioral therapy be implemented in physiotherapy, namely therapeutic
      exercise. Research to determine the effect of biopsychosocial physiotherapy models is scarce
      and insufficiently clear.

      The aims of this research are:

        1. Determine the efficacy of a biomedical model of physiotherapy in the treatment of
           chronic nonspecific low back pain,

        2. Determine the effectiveness of the biopsychosocial model of physiotherapy in the
           treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain, and

        3. Compare the effectiveness of these interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>By randomization, the subjects will be divided into three groups, two trial groups and a control group. In the first experimental group, the investigated interventions will consist of therapeutic exercises and back school. In the second experimental group, in addition to the therapeutic exercises and the back school, operative conditioning will be performed by the magister physiotherapy. The subjects in the control group will be exposed to the usual treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of interventions that will be applied in this study, blinding of therapists who will carry out the intervention regarding therapeutic exercises will not be possible to implement, but physiotherapists (apart creators of research) will not know the research hypothesis. Fully blinding of the examinees is also impossible to implement, but partially blinding will occur, as the patients in the biopsychosocial group will not explain the applied behavioral therapy. Blinding will be applied to researchers who will collect data (measure outcomes) and statisticians.</masking_description>

It consists of 14 questions, 7 questions for assessing depression, 7 for assessing anxiety, and the time period related to questions and answers last week. Responses are scored at four levels from 0 to 3 (0 = not at all, 3 = all the time) so the results may vary from 0 to 21 for depression or anxiety.

    <description>Assessment to avoid movement due to fear of pain, before and after the intervention, 3. i 6. after randomization.
It consists of 16 particles and each question is evaluated from 0 to 6. A higher score indicates a greater presence of fear / avoidance. FABQ is divided into two parts (work and physical activity), one measures the correlation of work with the current feeling of pain in low back pain, and the second connection of physical activity on the current sense of pain in low back pain.</description>

The instrument by which the subjective sense of individual health is measured through 12 questions examines the physical, psychological and social consequences caused by impaired health. With this questionnaire it is possible to quantitatively compare each dimension of health, because the score for each question are transformed into standard values and placed on the scale from 0 to 100 (the higher the score the better health) and thus get two major dimensions of health, physical and mental health, Physical Common Score-PCS and Mental Common Score-MCS.</description>
