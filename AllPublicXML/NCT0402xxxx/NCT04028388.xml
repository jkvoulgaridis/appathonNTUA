  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase IIb study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir (denoted ModraDoc006/r) in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer, suitable for treatment with a taxane.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label 1:1 randomized Phase IIb trial to determine the efficacy and
      tolerability of oral ModraDoc006/r versus i.v. docetaxel in mCRPC subjects. Cohort 1 will
      receive i.v. docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 Q3W. Cohort 2 will receive 30 mg ModraDoc006 in
      combination with 200 mg ritonavir in the morning and 20 mg ModraDoc006 in combination with
      100 mg ritonavir in the evening (7-12 hours after the morning dose), on Day 1, 8 and 15 of a
      21-day cycle. All patients will also receive 5 mg oral prednisone twice daily. Treatment in
      both cohorts will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      discontinuation for any other reason. The end of the trial is defined as the time point when
      all subjects have discontinued trial treatment and have been given follow-up for safety
      measurements according to the trial assessment schedule.

    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version 1.4 is a 14-item questionnaire to assess patients' satisfaction with medication, providing scores on four scales - side effects, effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction.

    <measure>EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has two components: health state description and evaluation.
In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.
In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).</description>
