  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The congenital heart disease (CHD) is the firts cause of congenital birth defects. Medical
      and surgical advances completely changed the epidemiology of CHD. Among these CHD, the
      univentricular heart, or single ventricle (SV), is a disease whose medical-surgical progress
      has completely changed the epidemiology.

      The SV at birth receives systemic and pulmonary venous returns in the single functional
      cavity and provides systemic and pulmonary flow. The SV undergoes a severe volumetric
      overload and considerably increases its work, which is not viable for the long time.

      In 1968, Professor Francis Fontan created the palliative surgery of the univentricular heart.
      It consists in establishing a derivation of the systemic venous blood from the two vena cava
      veins directly to the pulmonary arteries, without a sub-pulmonary ventricle. So, the VU no
      longer undergoes volumetric overload, and eliminates cyanosis.

      In this &quot;Fontan circulation&quot;, there is no pump to push the blood in the pulmonary arteries,
      only the remaining systemic post-capillary energy (reflection of the central venous pressure)
      allows to drive the blood through the lungs with a risk of stasis upstream (right overload)
      and a limited pre-charge downstream, which can lead to severe consequences: limited exercise
      capacity, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the SV, arrhythmia, cyanosis, cirrhosis and
      hepatic carcinoma, exudative enteropathy , plastic bronchitis, venous thromboses, deaths.

      There is a great heterogeneity within this family of SV with extremely varied evolutionary
      profiles. The cardiorespiratory exercise test, which has become a &quot;gold standard&quot;, makes it
      possible to assess the severity of CHD. In our study on the aerobic fitness of children with
      CHD, the investigators found that 44% of children with SV had normal aerobic fitness (&gt; 80%
      of the theoretical VO2max)1. Some good prognostic criteria are already described: left SV,
      good VU function, total cavopulmonary shunt in young age, etc. But the investigators know
      that these elements are not enough to explain why some SV, which the investigators will call
      the &quot;great-SV&quot;, have a better aerobic fitness.

      The main objective of our study is to describe the population of &quot;great SV&quot; (VO2max ≥ 80%)
      within the general population of SV. The investigators thus wish to determine the prognostic
      criteria favorable to a good aerobic fitness in univenticular heart disease.

      This study is cross-sectionnal, multicentric national (M3C network), descriptive,
      observational.

      Children ≥ 6 years old and adults with a single ventricle according to the international
      classification ACC-CHD and who had a cardiopulmonary exercise test in the year during usual
      follow-up will be included. Patients refuse the use of medical data will be excluded.

      The main objective of our study is to describe the rate of &quot;great SV&quot; (VO2max ≥ 80%) within
      the general population of SV. The secondary objectives are to compare the two groups: group
      &quot;great SV&quot; with VO2max ≥ 80% versus group SV with VO2max &lt; 80%.

      The following criteria will be collected

      Anatomical : left SV, right SV, undetermined SV, total cavopulmoary shunt, partial
      cavopulmonary shunt

      Clinic: NYHA status, saturation, medical treatment, number of surgery procedure, number of
      catheterization procedure, presence of pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, presence of
      arrythmia.

      Morbidity: number oh hospitalization during the year, presence of arrhythmia, cirrhosis and
      hepatic carcinoma, exudative enteropathy , plastic bronchitis, venous thromboses, stroke.

      Echocardiography: ejection fraction of SV, 2D Strain of SV, atrioventricular valve
      regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aspect of the flow in the cavopulmonary shunt.

      Cardiac MRI: ejection fraction of SV

      Cardiac catheterization: mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure,
      presence of fistulae.

      Cardiopulmonary exercise test : VO2max, anaerobic threesold, VE/VCO2 slope, oxygen uptake
      efficiciency slope, maximal heart rate, oxygene pulse and saturation at exercise.

      Pulmonary functional test : forced expiratory volume in 1 seconde (FEV1), the forced vital
      capacity (FVC), the FEV1/FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC%), DLCO and residual volume.
