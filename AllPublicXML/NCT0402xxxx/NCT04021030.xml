  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      intervention on the distribution and variability of pain level before and after intervention
      receipt among people with co-occurring chronic pain and Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) over a
      three-month follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is an open trial of the CBT intervention for 20 adults receiving detoxification
      treatment with comorbid pain. Participants will be screened for pain and other conditions by
      completing a self-report survey questionnaire. Eligible participants will be asked to
      complete a baseline assessment. A trained research therapist will conduct individual therapy
      with participants twice a week for 2-4 weeks. Participants will be re-assessed at 1- and
      3-month post-intervention follow-ups to track changes in their pain, functioning, and
      substance use.
