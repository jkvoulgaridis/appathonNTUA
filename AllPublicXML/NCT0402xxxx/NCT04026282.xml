      This is a Phase IV, prospective, randomized controlled study to investigate the cumulative
      live birth rates (CLBRs) of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol
      (GnRH-ant group) compared with the standard GnRH agonist long protocol (GnRH-a group) for
      controlled ovarian stimulation in supposed normal ovarian responders.

      This is a Phase IV, prospective, randomized controlled study to investigate the cumulative
      live birth rates (CLBRs) of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol
      (GnRH-ant group) compared with the standard GnRH agonist long protocol (GnRH-a group) for
      controlled ovarian stimulation in supposed normal ovarian responders.

      In this study, patients who are planning to undergo IVF/ICSI cycle aged ≤38 years old with
      normal ovarian reserve will be considered for enrollment. Approximately 888 patients will be
      enrolled at approximately 5 centers in China over a period of 10 months.

      About 12-20 visits will be performed in this study for each patient. The CLBR with first live
      birth resulting from one initiated COS cycle will be compared between GnRH-a group and
      GnRH-ant group.

    <description>To investigate the cumulative live birth rates in infertile women ≤ 38 years old with normal ovarian from one initiated COS cycle.
reserve using GnRH antagonist or agonist protocol for COS in ART treatment Numerator is the No. of women got their first live birth, the Denominator is the No. of women who attempt the ovarian stimulation.
There will be two ways to calculate the CLBR:
The conservative estimate of the cumulative live birth rate, which is based on the assumption that none of the women who do not return for a subsequent embryo transfer would have had a live birth.
The optimal estimate of the cumulative live birth rate, which is based on the assumption that women who do not return for a subsequent embryo transfer would have had the same live birth rates as those who do return.</description>
