  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective study (with two prospective
      cohorts), including previously treated patients with melanoma, squamous cell lung cancer in
      the late stages (inoperable or metastatic) and Hodgkin disease at any stages.

      The duration of the follow-up will be 12-60 months. Data from medical records will be
      retrospectively collected at different points in time. The first data extraction will consist
      of collecting data from the initial level (before treatment with immune checkpoints
      inhibitors (anti-PD1 / PDl1) before the end of the recruitment period for this study (up to 3
      years of follow-up). Two additional annual data collections are planned for display
      additional follow-up and data for patients who will survive.

        The target sample consists of approximately 350 treated patients, treatment of patients
        with melanoma, squamous cell lung cancer in the late stages (inoperable or metastatic) and
        Hodgkin dsisease, who met the criteria.

        The current study will be conducted in selected research centers where at least 5 patients
        are treated with blockers of immune checkpoints during the quarter (3 months) in the period
        from 2015 to 2019. In each research center, patients will be identified that meet the
        inclusion criteria, based on the lists of patients who received therapy with blockers of
        immune checkpoints in specific research centers. The study is conducted only in centers
        located in Russia.
