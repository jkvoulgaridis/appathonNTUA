    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab for subcutaneous (SC) administration as
      compared with those of the pertuzumab intravenous (IV) and trastuzumab IV formulations in
      Chinese participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early
      breast cancer.
