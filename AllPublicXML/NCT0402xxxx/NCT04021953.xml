  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial design to evaluate an online video
      series developed by a community-based organization in Singapore for gay, bisexual and queer
      men.

      A total of 300 HIV-negative, gay, bisexual and queer men in Singapore aged 18 to 29 years old
      will be recruited with the assistance of the partner community-based organization (CBO),
      Action for AIDS Singapore. Recruitment will utilize both online and offline channels, and
      with the help of other CBOs in Singapore. Participants should also not have watched the video
      prior to their participation in this study, which will be ascertained through a
      questionnaire.

      Participants will subsequently be randomized into the intervention arm (n=150) and the
      control arm (n=150). The treatment group (n=150) will be assigned the intervention along with
      sexual health information via a pamphlet, while the control group (n=150) will be assigned
      only the sexual health information via a pamphlet. This will be conducted through block
      randomization.

    <description>The online intervention comprises a series of six videos, each about 10-minutes in length, entitled the People Like Us series. The intervention was developed by gayhealth.sg and Action for AIDS Singapore in 2018. The series follow the love and sex lives of four ethnically-diverse GBQ men of varying socioeconomic backgrounds, as they negotiate issues of sexual health, mental health, and relationships throughout the six-part miniseries.
The intervention group will also be provided with an e-pamphlet on sexual wellness catered to GBMSM. This e-pamphlet has been developed by the National Skin Centre and Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinic specifically for information on sexual wellness among GBMSM. It comprises segments on HIV/STI symptoms, etiology, information on how to seek help for HIV/STI, behavioral and biomedical methods of HIV prevention.</description>
