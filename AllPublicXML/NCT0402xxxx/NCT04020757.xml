  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the proposed studies are first to delineate the physiological response of End
      Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) patients to exposure to a bath [HCO3-] of 35 mEq/L and an
      [acetate] of 4 mEq/L, and second, to determine whether reducing bath [HCO3-] will have the
      expected effect of decreasing or abolishing stimulation of organic acid production. A
      secondary endpoint will be whether the patients tolerate such a reduction and its impact on
      pre-dialysis blood [HCO3-]. If the outcome is positive in both regards, future studies will
      measure well-being and outcomes with reduced bath [HCO3-].

             or recent hospitalizations),

          4. Be reasonably nourished (serum albumin &gt; 3.5 g/dl and not currently receiving oral
             nutritional supplement through DCI).

          6. Functioning arteriovenous fistulas or grafts for dialysis access

          7. Currently dialyzing at a dialysate [HCO3-] of 33-37 mEq/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy,

          2. Acute illnesses of any kind,

          3. Hospitalization in the prior 3 months (except for vascular access related),

          4. Significant congestive heart failure, liver or lung failure.

          5. Pre-dialysis blood [HCO3-] &lt;19 mEq/L) (to reduce the risk of metabolic acidosis )
