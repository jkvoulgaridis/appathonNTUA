    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to quantify and characterize the outcomes of radiofrequency (RF)
      ablation after, and the utility of, electroanatomical mapping with the market-released HD
      mapping catheters Inquiry™ AFocusII™ Double Loop and Advisor™ HD Grid, Sensor Enabled™ with
      the EnSite Cardiac Mapping System and the EnSite Automap module in subjects with AF in the
      real-world environment of the Asian population.

    <measure>Acute- and long-term success rate of RF ablation after electroanatomical mapping with HD mapping catheters.</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of acute success defined as the proportion of subjects who receive HD mapping and RF energy delivery resulting in acute termination of clinical arrhythmia, defined by termination to SR (or AT if being treated for PersAF) or non-inducibility of clinical arrhythmia after ablation (cardioversion allowed prior to inducibility attempt). The rate of long-term success defined as the proportion of subjects who receive HD mapping and RF energy delivery with pre-defined procedural endpoints: AF freedom from all atrial arrhythmias (AF/AFL/AT) greater than 30 seconds (as documented by 24-hr Holter at 12-month follow-up) and on or off class I/III antiarrhythmic drug (AAD). AF freedom from all atrial arrhythmias (AF/AFL/AT) greater than 30 seconds (as documented by 24-hr Holter at 12-month follow-up) and off all class I/III AADs.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QoL): EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as change in quality of life score assessed by the validated QoL survey, EQ-5D-5L. The EQ-5D-5L is a descriptive system comprised of five questions related to mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each question has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
