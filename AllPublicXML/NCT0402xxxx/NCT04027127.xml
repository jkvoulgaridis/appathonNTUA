  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, Netrin -1; We found that patients with ACS increased at the time of admission,
      decreased TIMI 3 flow after angiography, and higher risk groups in high risk groups such as
      TIMI and GRACE were found to have higher Netrin-1 levels.

    <description>Netrin-1 in plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Mybıosource MBS044526 ) All assays were performed in duplicate. Plasma Netrin-1 is expressed in picograms (pg) per mg.</description>

    <description>Demographic characteristics, history, vital signs, laboratory findings, coronary angiography (CAG) and echocardiography (ECO) findings of the patients were recorded. Netrin-1 levels were studied with blood collected at the hospital and 6-8 hours after CAG. CAG results were evaluated by TIMI flow. The patients were divided into two groups with and without TIMI 3 flow and Netrin-1 levels were compared.
GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia) clinical risk assessments were performed and Netrin-1 values were compared.</description>
