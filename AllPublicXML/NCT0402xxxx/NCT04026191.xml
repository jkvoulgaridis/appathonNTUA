  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the residual risk of OrthoVisc-T (OVT) for the treatment of chronic lateral
      epicondylosis (Tennis Elbow). This trial will provide clinical data on a subject population
      not previously researched which have failed prior treatments for lateral epicondylosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthovisc-T is a sterile viscoelastic preparation supplied in a disposable glass syringe
      containing 2.0 mL of sodium hyaluronate (15 mg/mL) dissolved in physiological saline. The
      Orthovisc-T device is intended to relieve pain and restore function in tendons affected by
      chronic lateral epicondylosis. The hyaluronic acid solution provides extracellular
      supplementation of the elbow with lateral epicondylosis, lubricating and hydrating the
      affected site, thereby providing the ideal environment for healing of the damaged tissue.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the residual risk of two peri-osteotendinous
      injections of Orthovisc-T spaced one week apart for the relief of elbow pain and to restore
      function in patients with lateral epicondylosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older

          2. Diagnosis of chronic lateral epicondylosis defined as:

               1. Pain reproducible on palpation of the lateral epicondyle / common extensor
                  origin, and

               2. Pain reproducible during resisted wrist extension

          3. Failed prior treatment for lateral epicondylosis

          4. Able and willing to provide signed informed consent.

          5. Subject must be willing to abstain from other peri-articular treatments of the elbow
             for the duration of the study.

          6. Subject is willing to discontinue all analgesics including NSAIDs, except
             acetaminophen/paracetamol, at least seven days before the treatment injection and
             through the completion of the study.

          7. Subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 4.0 grams
             per day per the package insert) for the treatment of joint pain for the duration of
             the study. At least forty-eight hours prior to the Baseline Visit and each follow-up
             visit, the subject is willing to discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the hyaluronan

          2. Infection or skin disease in the area of the injection site or elbow joint

          3. Subject received a peri-articular injection of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and/or steroid in
             either elbow within 6 months of signing the informed consent form (ICF). A subject
             will be excluded if they are planning to receive an HA or steroid injection (other
             than the study injection) in either elbow during the course of this study.

          4. Known inflammatory or autoimmune disorders, or other pre-existing medical conditions
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact healing or affect the ability
             of the subject to complete the study and comply with the study requirements.

          5. Subject is taking medications at the time of signing the ICF which could interfere
             with the treatment procedure, healing and/or assessments. This includes but is not
             limited to oral or injectable anticoagulant treatments, anti-aggregant platelet
             treatment, chronic opioid analgesics. Low dose aspirin used for cardiovascular
             protection is allowed if a stable regimen is maintained for the duration of the study.

          6. Subjects who had an oral, intramuscular, intravenous, rectal suppository or topical
             (excluded in index elbow only) corticosteroid within 30 days of signing the ICF are
             excluded. Topical corticosteroid use at any site other than the index elbow is
             allowed.

          7. Subject is a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding at the Screening Visit or a woman
             of child bearing potential who refuses to use effective contraception during the
             course of the study.

          8. Subject was involved in any other research study involving an investigational product,
             or a new application of an approved product, within 60 days of signing the ICF.

          9. Subject is receiving or in litigation for worker's compensation.
