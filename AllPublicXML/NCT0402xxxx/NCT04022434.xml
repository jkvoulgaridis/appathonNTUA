  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few decades, fructose consumption has risen significantly in the United
      States1. This sugar is increasingly being used as a sweetener in a variety of foods1. Because
      there is a limited absorptive capacity for fructose, excessive ingestion of fructose leads to
      fructose malabsorption and dietary fructose intolerance (DFI) 2-9, 13. Incomplete absorption
      of fructose may lead to a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, pain, gas
      and diarrhea 2-9. In tertiary care centers, the prevalence of DFI in subjects with
      unexplained GI symptoms has been estimated to range between 11-50 %, when subjects were
      assessed with breath tests following administration of 25 grams of fructose 2, 5-7.

      Currently, the main treatment for DFI consists of restricting the intake of
      fructose-containing foods 10-12 or limiting the intake of foods with excess &quot;free fructose&quot;
      (ie, fructose in excess of glucose) or a high fructan content17. These diet restrictions can
      improve symptoms in patients with DFI 10-12,17. However, the diet is very restrictive and
      imposes a significant burden on the individual and the family. In one study, 40% of subjects
      were unable to comply with dietary restrictions 10. Currently, there are no other therapeutic
      agents for treating this condition 14, 15. Apart from promoting intestinal fructose
      absorption, an ideal therapeutic agent should be safe, simple to use, inexpensive and have no
      calorific value.

      Fructose is mostly absorbed in the small intestine by facilitated diffusion which is mediated
      by the GLUT-5 transporter protein. This protein is expressed on the intestinal mucosal
      surface. In the presence of glucose, fructose absorption is increased, mostly due to
      co-transport with glucose via the GLUT-2 transporter protein. However, the calorie content of
      glucose precludes its routine use in patients with DFI. Other compounds that promote fructose
      absorption, such as 3 O-methyl glucose and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have significant
      side effects and safety issues, making them unsuitable for clinical use in DFI.

      Several amino acids, including alanine, have been also been shown to increase intestinal
      fructose absorption 14. The postulated mechanism is as follows: transmucosal Na+-coupled
      amino acid transport causes increased water flow through the mucosal apical membrane14. This,
      in turn, facilitates fructose absorption by a process of 'solvent drag', caused by an
      increase in intraluminal fructose concentration caused by water removal from the lumen14. The
      potential benefit of alanine was assessed in a European study in healthy children 14. Ten
      subjects underwent H2 breath tests following administration of fructose alone (2g/ Kg body
      weight), followed by a combination of fructose and an equi-molar dose of various amino acids
      (L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, L-glutamine, L-proline) or glucose. Breath H2 production was
      assessed as a marker of intestinal fructose absorption. Subjects were asked to report any
      gastrointestinal symptoms during the test. All subjects had a positive (&gt;20 ppm of H2) breath
      test (68 ± 38 ppm) with fructose and 6/10 subjects reported either abdominal pain or diarrhea
      during the test. Co-administration of alanine caused a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in
      breath H2 production (3 ± 3 ppm), suggesting increased intestinal fructose absorption.
      Furthermore, none of the subjects reported any gastrointestinal symptoms during the test.

A standard measuring spoon will be provided to the subject for preparing the placebo solution. Subjects will mix the placebo in the beverage of their choice and consume this approximately 20 minutes before meals or snacks, in according with the dosing guidelines set for them by the dietitian.
