  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate counting steps by connected soles worn in the shoes
      of subjects, having recovered the maximum walking capacities of patients . To answer the
      question asked in the study, it is planned to include 60 patients over 70 years of age.

      The main objective of this interventional, monocentric, transverse, nonrandomized and
      prospective study is to assess the concordance of step counting between connected soles and
      video, in elderly subjects hospitalized in Follow-up and rehabilitation care, at Paul Brousse
      hospital, having recovered maximum walking capacities of participants, on 10 meters.

      After inclusion, following data will be collected : Measure blood pressure, heart rate,
      neurological and cardiological exam, pneumological exam, Short Physical Performance Battery
      Score

      Feetme connected soles comply with European standards (CE label no. 29762). The study will
      consist of 10-metre walk for patient during a rehabilitation session :

        -  By wearing the soles connected to patient's size (in patient's usual shoes). The
           recording of data will be triggered by an investigator, via an application downloaded on
           a smartphone. The application will trigger and stop the registration of soles.

        -  While being filmed by a camcorder mounted on a tripod (excluding the face) for
           footsteps.

      The test will be filmed (excluding the face) to avoid a measurement bias in counting steps.
      Two physician observers will view each patient's film in a second time in order to perform
      the step count.

      Before starting the walk, an on-site observer will ensure that the footings are set to 0 for
      counting step and that the recording is stopped after 10 metres.

      If this is deemed possible by the referring physiotherapist, the same protocol will then be
      carried out over 30 meters (new test: the patient who can do it will perform 40 meters in
      total (10 meters then test of 30 meters).

    <description>The main evaluation criterion is the number of steps taken by the patient to travel the distance of 10 meters. A ground marking will be done using a tape meter to highlight the distance of 10 meters.The number of steps will be counted using the connected soles and video. The soles count the step thanks to the foot pressure and the data are collected on smartphone. A video will be recorded simultaneously (fluted face) during the walk.</description>

    <description>Walk for 10 meters (and 30meters):
By wearing the European Community (EC) labelled connected soles in patient's shoes, triggered by smartphone- collection of data by smartphone
By being filmed by a camera camera mounted on a tripod (excluding the face) for steps counting (2 observers).
If there is a technical problem during the walk test, this one can be performed 1 time again 1 hour after initial test.This is expected to happen very rarely.</description>
