  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liquid Based Cytology is a method of preparing samples for examination in
      cytopathology.Liquid-based cytology (LBC), enables cells to be suspended in a monolayer. LBC
      makes better cytological assessment possible with improved sensitivity and specificity, since
      fixation is better and nuclear details are well preserved in the technique. Conventional
      cytology is gold standard for biliopancreatic malignancy examination. This method is operator
      depended and have high inter observer variation . On site evaluation increases the
      sensitivity of conventional cytology but requires the presence of pathologist at the time of
      sampling . Our study will compare LBC with conventional cytology ,If found to be non inferior
      will be great help in centre were on site evaluation cannot be carried out . It will further
      reduce the interobserver variation

    <description>.Liquid-based cytology (LBC), enables cells to be suspended in a monolayer. LBC makes better cytological assessment possible with improved sensitivity and specificity, since fixation is better and nuclear details are well preserved in the technique. Preneoplasticand neoplastic cells are not obscured by other cells, such as normal epithelial and inflammatory cells. LBC techniques are currently applied to cytological samples from several tissues or fluids. They include uterine cervix , endometrium, aspirates from breast , thyroid tumors, ascites and pleural effusion, and urine , LBC technology is suggested as an appropriate diagnostic method for metastatic tumors in cerebrospinal fluid .</description>
