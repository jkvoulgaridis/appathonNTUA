      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous γδT cells in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia
      (CLL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) expect for γδT lymphoma.

      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, open label, no control, prospective clinical trial.
      The study will include the following sequential phases: sign informed consent, γδT cells
      pre-culture, screening and registration to the trial, apheresis, γδT cells preparation,
      pre-treatment for lymphodepleting chemotherapy (selectable plan), treatment and follow-up.
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the autologous γδT cells in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia
      (CLL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) expect for γδT lymphoma.
