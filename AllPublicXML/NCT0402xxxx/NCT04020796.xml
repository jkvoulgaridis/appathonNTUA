      To assess the acute effects of only one dose of beet juice on hypertensive subjects treated
      with vascular endothelial function parameters, using the microvascular reactivity method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic arterial hypertension is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). Among the main modifiable environmental factors of hypertension, the investigators
      highlight inadequate eating habits, such as low vegetable consumption. Clinical studies have
      shown that inorganic nitrate from beet juice intake has a protective effect against CVD due
      to reduced blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation and prevention of endothelial
      dysfunction. However, there is still no consensus on its benefits of inorganic nitrate in
      vascular health. Associated with this, there are no previous studies in the literature that
      correlate the acute effects of inorganic nitrate intake on endothelial function assessed by
      microvascular reactivity through laser. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the
      acute effects (single dose) of inorganic nitrate, through the ingestion of beet juice, in the
      vascular parameters and endothelial function of treated hypertensive patients of both sexes.

    <description>A laser speckle contrast imaging system with a laser wavelength of 785 nm system will measure non-invasively real time cutaneous microvascular flow changes in the forearm. For the post occlusive reactive hyperemia test, arterial occlusion will be performed with suprasystolic pressure (50 mmHg above the systolic arterial pressure) using a sphygmomanometer applied to the arm of the subject over three minutes. Peak skin flow will be measured after pressure release.</description>
