      This will be an observational study looking at clinical and biomarker characteristics in
      patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Rapid Eye Movement
      Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) and matched controls. Saliva, plasma, serum, urine, and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected from participants.

      This is an observational study looking at clinical and biomarker characteristics in patients
      with Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Rapid Eye Movement Sleep
      Behavior Disorder (RBD) and matched controls. Saliva, plasma, serum, urine, and optional
      cerebrospinal fluid samples will be collected from participants. Samples will be assessed for
      levels of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Clinical characteristics will also be
      assessed.

      Misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates have the potential to serve as an early biomarker for PD
      and MSA, increasing the ability to diagnose and treat individuals with these diseases
      earlier. This study examines the effectiveness of using a novel technique for distinguishing
      between different parkinsonian disorders by measuring small misfolded Î±-synuclein aggregates
      in different biofluids.
