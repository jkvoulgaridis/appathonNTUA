  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy and oncological surgery is undergoing a major evolution. Some surgical dogmas are
      falling and care is better rationalized. The interactions between the patient and the
      caregivers on the other hand, and from the caregiver to the caregiver are favored. Thus was
      born, about 10 years ago, the principle of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS).

      But recovery has improved in the patient in the best possible shape in the operating room,
      and, during the gesture, minimize the negative effects of surgery and anesthesia. Finally,
      postoperatively, to re-empower the patient as quickly as possible.

      The interest of this study is the benefit of the quality of life of the patient being treated
      for cystectomy as part of an enhanced recovery program. This is to argue the diffusion of
      this program and the care teams for its realization.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An overall quality of life questionnaire adapted to each pathology, on a five-level Likert scale, will make it possible to estimate the percentage of patients whose quality of life will be &quot;good or very good&quot;.
The quality of life will be estimated globally through repeated measurements at each visit. It will be considered that if more than 80% of the answers are &quot;good or very good&quot;, the quality of life variable will be &quot;good or very good&quot;.</description>
