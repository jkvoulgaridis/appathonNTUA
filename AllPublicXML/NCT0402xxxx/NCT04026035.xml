  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to evaluate the PCR on whole blood approach to determine rapidly
      both the susceptibility and the identification of Staphylococcus responsible of septicemia in
      patients under hemodialysis with catheter. The results obtained with this novel experimental
      approach will be compared to those obtained on the same clinical samples by the routine
      diagnostic laboratory.

    <textblock>
      The outlook of current trends indicates that maximum effort is needed to tailor the initial
      antimicrobial therapy in patients under hemodialysis with catheter. Specific emphasis is put
      on early availability of antimicrobial susceptibility results by Diagnostic laboratories to
      optimize the management of those difficult infections.

      Direct whole blood PCR could allow a rapid determination of bacterial susceptibility to
      antibiotics. The study is designed to assess the concordance of a direct whole blood PCR
      targeting staphylococcus and its susceptibility to oracillin with the classical
      microbiological approach of samples from hemodialysis patients with catheter suspected of
      septicemia. This innovative approach should allow a faster diagnostic allowing the clinicians
      to better tailor the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy which has been proven crucial
      for a good clinical management of the patients.

      Moreover, the use of an adequate antimicrobial therapy early in the management of the
      patients, should not only lead to a better clinical outcome but also avoid unnecessary
      prescriptions of drugs which are the main drivers of the emergence and spread of
      antimicrobial resistance.

        Patients are treated in hemodialysis in the Nephrology Transplantation Dialysis Department
        of the Pellegrin Hospital of Bordeaux University Hospital. The hemodialysis unit of this
        service, supports a constant cohort of dialysis patients three times a week (Monday /
        Wednesday / Friday or Tuesday / Thursday / Saturday).

        Sepsis can occur during a hemodialysis session or be the cause of hospitalization.

        During an infectious episode, the patient is informed orally of the study and gives his
        oral and written consent to take an additional tube in order to carry out a bacteriological
        complementary analysis using a new technique to compare it to the &quot;gold standard&quot;.
