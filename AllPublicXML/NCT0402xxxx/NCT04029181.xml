             childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Potential subjects with cancer other than melanoma will be excluded from participation
             in this study if they meet exclusion criteria formulated in the MPDL3280A treatment
             study protocol (MPDL3280A-treatment-IST-UMCG).

          2. Signs or symptoms of infection within 2 weeks prior to anti-CD8 imaging agent
             injection.

          5. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of the anti-CD8 imaging agent, or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from complications.
