    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate differences in rate of recovery between young and
      middle-aged men after prolonged (downhill) running. Thirty healthy young (n=15, 18-30 y) and
      middle-aged (n=15, 35-50y) men will be recruited for this study. Participants will perform 60
      minutes of downhill run at 65% of their maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). Recovery
      parameters will be evaluated during 48 hours following the downhill protocol, and will
      include changes in performance tests, inflammatory markers, muscle integrity and heart-rate
      variability. Questioners will be used to evaluate muscle soreness and fatigue. We
      hypothesized that middle-aged males will have longer rate of recovery following the downhill
      running protocol, as compared to younger age males.

    <description>HRV (ms) quantifies the variability between heart beats. We will use the time-based analysis and the root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD) value. The measurements will be done continuously with a heart rate monitor. Baseline measurements will be done for 3 to 5 days before the downhill running and the average value will be defined as &quot;baseline HRV&quot;. Changes in HRV will be measured continuously in the 48 hours following the running. Percentage from &quot;baseline HRV&quot; will be calculated and compared between the two study's arms.</description>
