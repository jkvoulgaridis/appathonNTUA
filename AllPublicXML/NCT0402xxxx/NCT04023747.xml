  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OxPLoreD is an observational cohort study to identify clinical, genomic and immunological
      predictive markers of progression to malignant disease. Open to individuals diagnosed in the
      last 3 years with high count MBL, Binet Stage A CLL, Immunoglobulin G/A/M (IgG, IgA, IgM)
      MGUS, asymptomatic WM not requiring treatment and smouldering myeloma not requiring
      treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to monitor patients with early stage lymphoproliferative
      disorders not meeting criteria for treatment, including early stage Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukaemia (CLL), Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL), Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain
      Significance (MGUS), asymptomatic Waldenstroms Macroglobulinaemia (WM) and Smouldering
      Myeloma (SM).

      Each of these disorders has a pre-cancerous phase when abnormalities can be seen in the
      blood, however treatment may not be required. A minority of people with early stage
      lymphoproliferative disorders will go on to need treatment for blood or bone marrow cancer.

      Currently the investigators do not have a reliable way to predict which of these individuals
      with these disorders are more likely to develop a blood or bone marrow cancer. By studying a
      large group of individuals over time we hope to discover more about what factors might
      predict progression.The investigators may be able to identify markers which identify
      individuals who are more or less likely to develop blood or bone marrow cancer. These markers
      might be particular symptoms, gene changes called mutations or levels of particular molecules
      or cells in the blood or bone marrow. In the longer term this may enable us to identify those
      people who would benefit from certain types of treatment or from receiving treatment at an
      earlier stage and also to confidently reassure those who will never progress.

      Patients will be studied for up to 5 years with blood, bone marrow and saliva samples taken
      at key time-points to help answer these questions. In addition to looking for these markers
      we will also collect information about:

        -  What it is like to live with one of these conditions

        -  How many people with these conditions develop other significant medical conditions, such
           as serious infections, thrombosis (blood clots) or other types of cancer.
