  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PANACEA trial is an investigator-initiated prospective, single-center, two-arm,
      non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial of high-dose IV N-Acetylcysteine therapy used
      as an adjunct to pharmaco-invasive reperfusion in patients presenting early after a large
      STEMI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within 3 hours of symptom
      onset and satisfying all of the inclusion criteria after informed consent would be randomly
      allocated to either intravenous N-Acetylcysteine or standard treatment using a 1:1 allocation
      ratio. Those randomized to IV N-Acetylcysteine would be administered a bolus of 1200 mg over
      0.5 hours (in 5% Dextrose) followed by 600mg/hour for the remaining 47.5 hours (in 5%
      dextrose). A total N-acetylcysteine dose of 29.7 grams is administered over 48 hours. The
      infusion is continued during the primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients would
      be followed up for a minimum of 90 days. The primary clinical endpoint will be myocardial
      infarct size measured by late gadolinium enhancement CMR imaging at 3-5 days from first
      medical contact. Primary feasibility outcome will be the rate of recruitment, the number of
      patients undergoing cardiac MRI within the stipulated time frame, and completeness of the
      study data collection.
