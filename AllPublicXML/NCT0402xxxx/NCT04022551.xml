  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regardless of the reason for ED visit and its care plan, there are simple interventions,
      which may be continued to prevent short-term ED adverse outcomes. Delirium, motor
      deconditioning, adverse drug reactions due to polypharmacy, and inappropriate home support
      are the main conditions to target when taking care of older ER users.

      Evidence based medicine showed that simple and early intervention in the process of care may
      prevent delirium (e.g., hydration, avoid restraint, mobilize and satisfy basic needs, time
      and place reorientation) and motor deconditioning (e.g., encourage mobility, up to chair at
      meal time during day light hours, provide appropriate walking aid) in older patients. The
      medication reconciliation is also an efficient intervention for the prevention of adverse
      drug reactions. Furthermore, an early assessment of home support is a crucial step to adjust
      home services for an early discharge to home.
