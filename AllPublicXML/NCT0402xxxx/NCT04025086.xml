    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating if a specific protocol, that can be framed in the innovative
      concept of Perioperative Goal Directed Therapy (PGDT), based on the evaluation of the Stroke
      Volume Variation (SVV) - a parameter deriving from the adoption of a minimally invasive
      advanced hemodynamic monitoring technology with a special sensor called FloTrac速 (Edwards) or
      of a non-invasive monitoring system with the Clearsight速 sensor (Edwards) - is able to
      guarantee a greater precision in the intraoperative management of patients undergoing spinal
      surgery in prone position.
