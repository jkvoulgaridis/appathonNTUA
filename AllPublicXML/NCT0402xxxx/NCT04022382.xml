    <textblock>
      A study which participants with mild to moderate dry eye disease will have a punctum of one
      eye injected with 0.1ml Restylane Defyne and the other eye injected with 0.2ml Restylane
      Defyne. Participants will be evaluated over four visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21 to 80 years of age

          -  Baseline OSDI score of at least 13 with no more than 3 responses of &quot;not applicable&quot;

          -  In both eyes, a baseline Schirmer test with anesthetic of â‰¤ 10mm/5 minutes

          -  Literate, able to speak English and able to complete the questionnaire independently

          -  Willing to sign the informed consent and deemed capable of complying with the
             requirements of the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of ophthalmic cyclosporine or lifitegrast within 30 days prior to Day 0

          -  History of surgical punctal occlusion (e.g., cautery), canalicular infection or
             canalicular surgery

          -  Corneal transplant in either eye

          -  Ocular surgery (such as cataract surgery or LASIK) in either eye within six months of
             the Baseline Visit

          -  A systemic condition or disease not stabilized or judged by the investigator to be
             incompatible with participation in the study (e.g. current systemic infection,
             uncontrolled autoimmune disease, uncontrolled immunodeficiency disease)

          -  The history or presence of any ocular disorder or condition in either eye that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the interpretation of the study
             results (e.g., significant corneal or conjunctival scarring, pterygium or nodular
             pinguecula; current ocular infection (except mild blepharitis), conjunctivitis or
             inflammation not associated with dry eye; anterior (epithelial) basement membrane
             corneal dystrophy or other clinically significant corneal dystrophy or degeneration;
             history of ocular herpetic infection; evidence of keratoconus; lid or lacrimal cancer.

          -  Active severe systemic allergy, seasonal allergies, rhinitis or sinusitis requiring
             changes in treatment within 30 days prior to the study or likely to require changes in
             treatment during the course of the study (i.e. antihistamines, decongestants, oral,
             topical or aerosol steroids)

          -  Participation in a clinical trial during the past 30 days

          -  Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or nursing at study entry.
