  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 2015 Montgomery vs Lanarkshire Health Board ruling, the consent process in the UK
      has had to change. In practice, this means that doctors must ask themselves whether the
      patient knows about the material risks of the treatment being proposed, alternatives to the
      treatment, and whether reasonable care has been taken to ensure the patient actually knows
      this. This study aims to determine patients' perspectives of consent for major cancer surgery
      in light of the Lanarkshire ruling.

      A patient satisfaction survey was administered to patients who had undergone urological,
      gynaecological, colorectal, and plastic surgical procedures at a specialised cancer centre
      where changes to consent processes in light of the Lanarkshire ruling had been implemented.
