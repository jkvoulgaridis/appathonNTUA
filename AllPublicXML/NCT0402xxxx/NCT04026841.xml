      This study is a single-center,prospective interventional clinical study, all subjects
      enrolled are multiple primary lung cancer patients with ground-glass density in CT scan.The
      samples plan for the study was 36 cases.The enrolled patients will receive intravenous
      infusion of Sintilimab 200mg every 3 weeks up to 4 cycles, and the efficacy will be evaluated
      after cycle 2 and 4 using RECIST criteria (version 1.1 ).
