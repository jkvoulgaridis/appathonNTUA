      The three interventions are:

        1. To Apply local dry heat.

        2. To apply high tourniquet pressure.

        3. To apply both of them. (Dry heat and high pressure) The common comparator: Current
           Clinical practice for peripheral venous catheterization.

      The main hypothesis: The number of attempts of success venipuncture at first time are
      influenced by any of the interventions applied before.

      The main goal: To identify the most effective intervention of applying dry local heat and/or
      high tourniquet pressure in relation of number success venipuncture attempts, compared to
      current clinical practice.

      Design: An experimental, randomized study which is controlled with current clinical practice
      to insert a peripheral vein catheter. It is an incomplete cross-over clinical trial, with
      three arms which are involved interventions and a common comparator.

      Population: Adult healthy subjects. Sample size: It is required to enroll 54 subjects with a
      95% of level of confidence and 80% level of power.

      Main variable: Succeed peripheral vein catheter insertion at first attempt.

      Effectiveness assessment: The optimal effectiveness is considered when vein cannulation
      success at first attempt exceeds 95% applying any of the interventions.

      Planned date to address: It is planned to carry out around June and/or July of 2017 for the
      main variable.

      The study is considered a low level intervention clinical trial to evaluate the use and
      safety of a sanitary product marketed and accredited for a different aim, but according to
      their rules of using.

      It is experimental, randomized and controlled study with the usual technique of inserting a
      venipuncture catheter until now. Incomplete clinical trial, blind to third parties, in
      healthy volunteers, which consists of three arms, in which they are intervened and the
      comparator is applied. The volunteers comes from a bioequivalence clinical trial for testing
      a new drug, and a venous catheter is required in two period between a wash-out period of one
      week, approximately.

      For each volunteer one of intervention is applied in one period, and in other period the
      comparator is applied. Thus, one intervention and the sequence of one intervention
      application and comparator is assigned by randomization using sealed envelopes. Randomization
      is only performed in first period, in second period one intervention or comparator assigned
      in applied. Thus, each one volunteer is her/his own comparator

      . Before assigned intervention or comparator is applied, a Venous International Assessment is
      carried out using Venous International Assessment (VIA) validated scale by nurse perception
      and palpation. After assigned intervention, another VIA is performed. Then, when peripheral
      venous catheterization is achieved, a blood sample is withdrawn in order to examine
      hemolysis. Afterwards, pain is registered by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) validated scale
      within no more than two hours from vein catheterization, and skin perception is evaluated by
      Fitzpatrick's scale (only in first period) in order to analyze a possible relationship with
      adverse events on skin. Subjects are followed-up for 72h in order to monitor adverse events
      if applicable.

      According to hemolysis, an ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA) blood sample is processing
      at 3400 revolutions per minute at 4 Celsius grades for 10 minutes, and plasma samples are
      frosted for 24-48h. Afterwards, they are defrosted, and analyzed by absorbance using NANODROP
      SPECTROPHOTOMETER. The analysis by spectrophotometer is blinded of intervention or comparator
      used to withdrawn.

    <measure>Number of the Grade of Venous International Assessment (VIA) Scale After Application of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to ten minutes after application of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Vein perception in VIA scale was considered as the self-reported visual observation or palpation of a venous pathway.
Subjects were graded using the current clinical practice vein stagnation with an elastic compressor application (Unidix®).
Five grades considering the numbers of points of optimal puncture visible and tangible, in one of the dorsal veins of the hand, forearm cephalic and/or basilic.
Grade I: At least six. Grade II: At least four. Grade III: At least three. Grade IV: At least one. Grade V: None.
Therefore, the best grade is I, and the worst grade is V. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of the Grade in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain After Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 hours after application of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in pain was measured by integer number. Pain was self-expressed by participants, in a range from 0 to 10.
10: was considered the worst pain experienced 0: no pain perceived.
The entire range was 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Therefore, higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants in Each Type of Skin Standardized According to Fitzpatrick Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 hours after application of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants in each type of skin standardized according to Fitzpatrick scale. Fitzpatrick scale is the UNABBREVIATED scale that indicates different types of skin described as &quot;phototypes&quot;. The individuals were graded clinically by sel-expressed by participants in the area of the forearm not exposed to the sun.
In a range of six phototypes, where phototype I corresponds with the minimum and phototype VI the maximum.
Phototype I: Ivory white, burns easily, never tans. Phototype II: White, burns easily, tans minimally with difficulty. Phototype III: White, burns moderately, tans moderately and uniformly Phototype IV: Beige-olive, lightly tanned, burns minimally, tans moderately and easily.
Phototype V: Rarely burns, tans profusely. Phototype VI: Dark brown or black, never burns, tans profusely.
Phototype I was considered more risky outcome for expected adverse events in skin. None was considered better or worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Hemolysis in Absorbance Units</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 9 days after first intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>Detection level of absorbance values of hemolysis in plasma samples. The units of absorbance are dimensionless. The hemolysis in plasma is analyzed by spectrophotometry method, using a NanoDrop® 2000 Spectrophotometer device (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, United States of America).
The following equation was used to correct lipemia: (A414-A385) +0.16xA385. Additionally, a baseline correction factor at 750 nanometer wavelength was applied. Therefore, absorbance were measured at 414 nanometer, 385 nanometer and 750 nanometer.
Higher values represent a worse outcome: higher value mean higher hemolysis in a blood sample.
Therefore, lower values, near to zero are better outcomes that mean low hemolysis in blood sample.</description>

          <description>Vein perception in VIA scale was considered as the self-reported visual observation or palpation of a venous pathway.
Subjects were graded using the current clinical practice vein stagnation with an elastic compressor application (Unidix®).
Five grades considering the numbers of points of optimal puncture visible and tangible, in one of the dorsal veins of the hand, forearm cephalic and/or basilic.
Grade I: At least six. Grade II: At least four. Grade III: At least three. Grade IV: At least one. Grade V: None.
Therefore, the best grade is I, and the worst grade is V.</description>

        <description>Vein perception in VIA scale was considered as the self-reported visual observation or palpation of a venous pathway.
Subjects were graded using the current clinical practice vein stagnation with an elastic compressor application (Unidix®).
Five grades considering the numbers of points of optimal puncture visible and tangible, in one of the dorsal veins of the hand, forearm cephalic and/or basilic.
Grade I: At least six. Grade II: At least four. Grade III: At least three. Grade IV: At least one. Grade V: None.
Therefore, the best grade is I, and the worst grade is V. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Number of participants in each type of skin standardized according to Fitzpatrick scale. Fitzpatrick scale is the UNABBREVIATED scale that indicates different types of skin described as &quot;phototypes&quot;. The individuals were graded clinically by sel-expressed by participants in the area of the forearm not exposed to the sun.
In a range of six phototypes, where phototype I corresponds with the minimum and phototype VI the maximum.
Phototype I: Ivory white, burns easily, never tans. Phototype II: White, burns easily, tans minimally with difficulty. Phototype III: White, burns moderately, tans moderately and uniformly Phototype IV: Beige-olive, lightly tanned, burns minimally, tans moderately and easily.
Phototype V: Rarely burns, tans profusely. Phototype VI: Dark brown or black, never burns, tans profusely.
Phototype I was considered more risky outcome for expected adverse events in skin. None was considered better or worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Detection level of absorbance values of hemolysis in plasma samples. The units of absorbance are dimensionless. The hemolysis in plasma is analyzed by spectrophotometry method, using a NanoDrop® 2000 Spectrophotometer device (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, United States of America).
The following equation was used to correct lipemia: (A414-A385) +0.16xA385. Additionally, a baseline correction factor at 750 nanometer wavelength was applied. Therefore, absorbance were measured at 414 nanometer, 385 nanometer and 750 nanometer.
Higher values represent a worse outcome: higher value mean higher hemolysis in a blood sample.
Therefore, lower values, near to zero are better outcomes that mean low hemolysis in blood sample.</description>
