  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, observer-blind, controlled intervention study with parallel
      groups is to study the effect of resistance training (2x/week for 8 weeks) with and without
      different goals of protein intake on muscle strength, function and mass, oxidative stress
      parameters and the immune system in community dwelling persons.

      Participants (n = 137) will be community-dwelling older adults. After a pre-participation
      screening participants will be distributed randomly but stratified by sex and age to one of
      the 3 groups (low protein + strength training, high protein + strength training, low protein
      and no strength training(=control)). Study participants are eligible if they are male or
      female with an age between 65 and 85 years and if their cognitive status as well as their
      physical fitness level allows to participate at the strength training sessions. Exclusion
      criteria comprise chronic diseases which contraindicate the training sessions, serious
      cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and manifest osteoporosis, a frailty index at or
      above 3, medication with anticoagulants or cortisone drugs and also regular strength training
      during the last six months.

      Primary outcome measure is the change in the Chair Stand Test. Secondary outcome measures
      comprise anthropometric data, functional performance tests, immunological and oxidative
      stress parameters, microbiota, metabolomics, proteomics and the nutritional status.

    <measure>Change from baseline in isometric quadriceps peak torque (Nm/kg)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after dietary intervention (6 weeks) and after dietary and strength training (14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic peak torque measurements of knee extensors and flexors will be performed using a LIDO Multijoint II isokinetic loading dynamometer. Participants will be tested in a sitting posion with their hip flexed at approximately 90° and subjects securely strapped to the seat of the chair using adjustable trunk and waist stabilisation belts. The anatomic axis of the knee rotation at the knee joint will aligned with the machine axis of rotation to insure similar movements for all participants. Two continuous maximal repetitions of knee extensors and knee flexors will be performed concentrically at each angular velocity (60°/s and 120°/s) for peak torque recording.</description>

    <description>Handgrip strength of the right hand will be measured to the nearest kilogram (kg) using a hand Dynamometer. Participants will be encouraged to perform a maximal contraction within approximately 4 to 5 s. After a rest of 60 s, participants will be asked to perform a second trial. The highest score of maximum voluntary contraction will be used for data analyses.</description>
