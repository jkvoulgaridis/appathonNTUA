      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of SMR neurofeedback training on
      cognitive performance and electrical brain activity in elderly with cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk to progress to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Slowing down effect of dementia by enhancing brain plasticity represents on of
      the most prominent challenges. Neurofeedback is one of the promising techniques that showed
      therapeutic efficacy and cognitive improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      epilepsy, stroke. The investigators aim to study the effects of a sensorimotor neurofeedback
      training protocol (SMR) on cognitive performances in elderly and to assess whether MCI
      patients change in brain electrical activity after training.

    <description>Three interventions will be administered :
An electroencephalography recording (EEG) for 30 minutes with an electrocap of 19 scalp locations according to the international 10-20 EEG placement system.
The second intervention is the neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires. They will be done in one session for approximately 2hours.
The third intervention is the neurofeedback training sensorimotor that will be recorded at channel Cz according to the international 10-20 system.</description>

    <description>Neurofeedback experiment will consist of 20 sessions of neurofeedback training, twice or three times a week during seven weeks. Each session will last for 40 minutes. The experimental group will undergo questionnaires, EEG recording and neuropsychological assessments in three-time points, pre-training (T0), post-trianing (T1) and 1 month follow-up (T2). Electroencephalography will be recorded by a technician in EEG for each participant, EEG power spectrum will be calculated in pre (T0) and post neurofeedback training/psycho-pedagogical care at T1 and T2.</description>
