  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-control, exploratory study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (5-ALA HCl) and
      sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) added on artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) compared
      with ACT alone in the treatment of malaria. Patients who are suffering from uncomplicated
      malaria, are eligible for randomization.The study will be conducted in a total of 75 patients
      with uncomplicated malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 75 patients will be randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to 3 arms:

      Arm 1: placebo+ACT group (15 patients)

      Arm 2: 5 ALA/SFC+Placebo+ACT twice daily (BID) (30 patients)

      Arm 3: 5-ALA/SFC+Placebo+ACT once daily (QD) (30 patients)

      The study duration will be a maximum of 98 days with treatment period of 7 days and follow-up
      period of 91 days.
