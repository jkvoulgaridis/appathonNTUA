  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy in the Department of Vascular Surgery at Oslo
      University Hospital are consecutively included in this evaluation og pre- and postoperative
      brain MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing surgery for carotid stenosis in our Department are examined by brain MRI
      before and after carotid surgery to evaluate the rationale for the MRI. Brain lesions on MRI
      before and after carotid surgery are registered, and related to clinical findings. The
      purpose of the study is to evaluate whether brain MRI in relation to carotid endarterectomy
      gives additional information to clinical findings, and to CT scan of the brain.

    <description>Brain MRI diagnoses tromboembolic lesions or bleeding to the cerebrum and is part of preoperative diagnostic tests before carotid surgery. After surgery brain MRI may present New lesions related to surgery, clinically significant or insignificant. Our goal is to evaluate the relevance of this modality in carotid surgery..</description>

        Patients referred to the Department of Vascular Surgery at Oslo University Hospital for
        carotid endarterectomy. International guidelines on indications for surgery are followed,
        and the majority of the patients have symptomatic carotid stenosis occluding &gt; 70% of the
        lumen of the internal carotid artery. Patients characteristics and indications for surgery
        are registered
