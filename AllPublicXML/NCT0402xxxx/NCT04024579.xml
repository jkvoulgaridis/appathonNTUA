  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-arm multicenter medical device study to investigate the clinical
      efficacy and safety of the treatment of actinic keratosis with a 5% potassium hydroxide
      solution.

      In total, 68 patients with actinic keratosis grade I/II, who meet all inclusion criteria and
      do not meet none of the exclusion criteria are to be enrolled and topically treated twice
      daily for up to 3 cycles of 14 days of treatment followed by 14 non-treatment days.

      The primary objective is treatment success at the individual end-of-treatment visit of all AK
      lesions present at baseline and treated with the investigational product.

      Beside this, adverse events will be collected at each visit and evaluated in order to
      investigate clinical safety.
