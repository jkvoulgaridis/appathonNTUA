  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg BID
      compared with enalapril 10 mg BID, in addition to conventional heart failure (HF) treatment,
      in improving a hierarchical composite of cardiovascular (CV) events (i.e. CV death or the
      occurrence of first HF hospitalization) and causing a greater reduction in n terminal
      prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, at Week 12 from Baseline) in participants
      with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) caused by CCC.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 4, multinational, multicenter, parallel-group, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint adjudication, active-controlled study to demonstrate superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril in improving a composite of CV events (CV death or first HF hospitalization), or in causing greater reduction or lesser increase in NT-proBNP levels at Week 12 in participants with HFrEF caused by CCC.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hierarchical composite endpoint composed of time to CV death, time to first HF hospitalization, relative change in NT-proBNP from baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Total follow up time up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the win ratio approach comparing every participant in the sacubitril/valsartan arm to every participant in the enalapril arm to determine a winner. The estimated win ratio (the total number of winners in the sacubitril/valsartan arm divided by the total number of winners in the enalapril arm) will be provided. A winner in the pair-wise comparison has a delayed time to the occurrence of CV death; if time to the occurrence of CV death is censored, a winner has a delayed time to the occurrence of first HF hospitalization event; if the times to both CV events are censored, a winner has a more favorable (less increase or more decrease) change in NT-proBNP between Baseline and Week 12.</description>
