  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study investigating folate deficiency (lack of folic acid in the blood) in patients
      who take the drug olaparib to treat their advanced ovarian or breast cancer. The primary goal
      of this study is to determine the frequency and timing of folate deficiency, and to learn
      more about whether giving folic acid supplements (vitamins) will help delay or avoid
      deficiency in these patients. Deficiency can cause doctors to reduce or stop treatment with
      olaparib. In this case, patients are not getting the best treatment for their cancer due to
      the unwanted side effect.
