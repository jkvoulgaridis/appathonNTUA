  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well an investigational scan (magnetic resonance elastography [MRE])
      works with standard imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in detecting response to
      treatment in patients with liver cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Diagnostic procedures, such as MRE with MRI, may make it easier for researchers to see if the
      treatment for liver cancer is working.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography (MRE) to detect changes in
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between baseline and after initial 6 weeks of treatment
      (change in MRE liver tumor stiffness compared to percent non-viable/necrotic tumor).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate MRE imaging measurements with patient survival (overall survival and time to
      tumor progression) over 18 months.

      II. Correlate MRE measurements with change in tumor size and enhancement on standard of care
      MR imaging sequences.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care MRI and MRE over 60-90 minutes within 5 days of liver
      biopsy before receiving any medical treatment for HCC, at 6 weeks after medical treatment for
      HCC, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression.
