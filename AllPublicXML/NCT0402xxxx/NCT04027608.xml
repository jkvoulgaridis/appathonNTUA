  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While a substantial body of research suggests that RRV is related to obesity, there is very
      little research on factors that contribute to the RRV of food, particularly how patterns of
      eating can increase or decrease the motivation to eat specific foods. Our previous work has
      demonstrated that a subset of obese individuals show increases in RRV of food after repeated
      consumption of large portions of HED snack foods, which we have conceptualized as
      sensitization. Our preliminary data suggest that sensitization of the RRV of HED food is a
      predictor of weight gain over time. However, more work needs to be done to address this
      relationship using a planned, prospective study design, using adolescent research subjects,
      and examining potential moderators of this relationship.

      The purpose of this study is to measure the reinforcing value of a preferred low energy
      density and high energy density snack food. We will also look at the reinforcing value of
      exercise and how these values may lead to long term weight gain in adolescents. We
      hypothesize that sensitization to HED food will be associated with greater weight at the time
      of testing as well as greater weight gain over time, while sensitization to LED food will be
      associated with lower BMI percentile at the time of testing in adolescents.

    <description>Each child will be asked to eat two different snack foods over the course of two weeks each. The RRV of that food (vs alternative reinforcer) will be tested and baseline and post exposure. Increases in RRv for food after monotony will be considered sensitization to that food. All children will be followed to observe weight change over time for 2 years each.</description>

        Adolescents living in the Western New York area, aged 12-14 years at the time of
        enrollment. Flyers were posted in the community within a 30 min drive of UB South Campus.
        Additionally, flyers were sent to list serves, posted on facebook, and distributed to both
        private and public schools within a 40 min drive of the university campus.
