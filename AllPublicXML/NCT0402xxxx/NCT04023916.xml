      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab and R-CHOP
      regimen as the first-line treatment for DLBCL patients with TP53 mutation and PD-L1 positive.

    <textblock>
      This Phase II, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of induction treatment consisting of Sintilimab in combination with Rituximab plus
      chemotherapy (R-CHOP) as the first-line treatment in participants with DLBCL, followed by
      consolidation treatment with Sintilimab alone in patients who achieve CR at the end of
      induction.For safety reasons, the initial enrollment of the first 6 patients in the study
      will be slow and conduct intensive monitoring for safety. If the dose-limited toxicity event
      was observed in more than 2 of the first 6 patients and was assessed caused by cumulative
      exposure to the study drug combination therapy, the trial will be stopped.This study also aim
      to evaluate the correlation of clinical efficacy to the expression of
      PD-L1,PD-1,CD3,CD4,CD8,CD56,CD58,β2-MG，HLA-DR/DP/DQ and so on by immunohistochemical
      techniques.
