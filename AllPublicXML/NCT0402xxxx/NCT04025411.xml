  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mirror Therapy (TM) has been shown to be effective in motor rehabilitation of the hemiplegic
      upper limb, but its implementation in current clinical practice has several difficulties,
      both from the patient and physiotherapist point of view.

      A new computerized Mirror Therapy (TM) device (Intensive Visual Simulation 3 (IVS3),
      Dessintey) which aims to solve the TM compliance problems and make it more efficient have
      been developed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the observance and efficiency of the Intensive Visual
      Simulation 3 (IVS3) therapy as compared to traditional Mirror Therapy (TM) in a population of
      hemiplegic stroke patients.

    <description>Measured by Frenchay Arm Test score at baseline, at 18 days, at 32 days, and at 60 days.
Frenchay Arm Test score assesses functional improvement of the activities of the upper limb paretics with minimum score at 0 (total dependence) and maximum score at 100 (complete autonomy).</description>

    <description>Measured by Abilhand questionnaire at baseline, at 18 days, at 32 days, and at 60 days.
Abilhand questionnaire will allow self-evaluation of the function of the upper limb in daily life with minimum score at 0 (difficulties in daily life) and maximum score at 46 (no difficulties in daily life).</description>
