  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to compare the effect of an aerobic exercise session in
      two different populations. Sampling biological material and collecting health-related
      personal data entails minimal risks and burdens. Participants will be asked to perform 30
      minutes of an aerobic exercise on an ergocycle at a fixed power output to correspond to a
      moderate intensity for a sedentary population.

      Background Among genetic causes of hyperhomocysteinemia, classical homocystinuria, manifest
      not only with vascular diseases but also with neurological symptoms. This is related to the
      higher homocysteine concentration of up to 150-300 μmol/l without treatment. Recently, some
      articles have shown that mild and temporary hyperhomocysteinemia may follow exercise in a
      healthy population. Investigators hypothesized that increase in homocysteine may be of
      greater importance in patients with classical homocystinuria where cystathionine
      beta-synthase deficiency prevents homocysteine metabolism.

      Objective To investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise in patients with classical
      homocystinuria on metabolic parameters compared to healthy controls.
