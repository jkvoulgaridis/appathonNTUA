  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the therapeutic response of oral gepotidacin
      compared to oral nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated UTI in adolescent and adult female
      subjects. In this study, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      oral gepotidacin or oral nitrofurantoin. The study will enrol approximately 1200 subjects
      with uncomplicated UTI. The duration of the study will be approximately 28 days.
