  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Potential study participants will be recruited at breast cancer survivor support groups.
      Informed consent will be obtained with a form approved by the TWU IRB and participants will
      complete 4 tests. Then participants will be randomly assigned to one of two computer-assisted
      cognitive programs. Participants will be sent by email, exercises specific to their assigned
      computer-assisted cognitive program from Happyneuron Pro
      (http://ie.scientificbraintrainingpro.eu/). Cognitive training on the computer entails 30
      minutes a day, five times a week for one month. At the end of the study, the four pretests
      will be repeated, a satisfaction survey administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential study participants will be recruited using a recruitment script and recruitment
      brochure at breast cancer survivor support groups. Participants recruited to the study will
      be contacted to set up a pre-test data collection session. Prior to any testing, informed
      consent will be obtained with a form approved by the TWU IRB. After informed consent is
      obtained participants will complete tests of Digit Span Task, FACT-Cognitive Function
      (Version 3), Quality of Life Patient/Cancer Survivor Version and Engagement in Meaningful
      Activities Survey, and issued a tablet if they prefer. Then participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two computer-assisted cognitive programs. Participants will be sent by
      email, exercises specific to their assigned computer-assisted cognitive program from
      Happyneuron Pro (http://ie.scientificbraintrainingpro.eu/). Cognitive training on the
      computer entails 30 minutes a day, five times a week for one month. 6. At the end of the
      study, the four pretests will be repeated, a satisfaction survey administered, and any issued
      tablets collected. Pre and post testing, obtaining of written consent, and issuing and
      returning a tablet will occur at the support group location. If this location is not
      available, they will occur at TWU in a quiet room. If TWU is not convenient to the
      participant, a quiet location that is suitable to maintain confidentiality for the
      participant will be chosen in collaboration with the participant.

    <measure>Digit span</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Working memory was measured by the digit span, shown to discriminate between BCS and controls.19 It takes approximately 10 minutes to administer and has high reliability (.891) for forward span and low for backwards span (.598).</description>

    <measure>FACT-COG</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-COG contains 4 subscales of perceived cognitive impairment, comments from others, perceived cognitive abilities, and impact of cognition on quality of life which are summed to provide a score. Fact-Cog demonstrates acceptable test-retest reliability (.707) and validity (.762)</description>
