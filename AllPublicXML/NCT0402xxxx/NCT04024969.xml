  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
      Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a 'lumbar
      puncture' (a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine). Patients often
      report they find it painful and it can cause unintended complications requiring
      hospitalisations or time off work to recover.

      Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not
      always the case. Doctors do not find abnormalities in everyone who has MS but some people
      with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar
      puncture abnormalities. Both of these problems can lead to misdiagnosis.

      A new MRI scan allows doctors to see small veins that run through damaged areas of the brain
      in people with MS. It has been shown that this is a specific finding to MS, seldom seen in
      other conditions. It is not painful and carries few or no risks.

      This research aims to change the way people are diagnosed with MS and reduce the number of
      lumbar punctures used. The investigators will recruit a large number of people from different
      hospitals whose doctors suspect they may have MS. They will be invited to have the new
      eight-minute MRI scan. After 18 months, the investigators will find out what diagnosis is
      eventually reached and compare this to the finding of the new scan. The investigators will
      then compare the accuracy, speed, costs and acceptability of the different tests needed to
      make a diagnosis of MS and establish if most lumbar punctures can be replaced by a slightly
      longer MRI scan. This research could provide the National Health Service with a scientific
      approach to diagnose MS which is safer, more cost effective and importantly, more acceptable
      to patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The North American Imaging in MS Cooperative has reviewed the utility of the central vein
      sign (CVS) in the diagnosis of MS in 2015. They concluded that &quot;To formally establish the
      clinical value of the CVS for the differential diagnosis at disease onset, a large,
      prospective, multicentre study including patients at first presentation of possible MS is
      necessary&quot;. The paper outlining the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS specifically
      mentions the promise of the CVS but suggests that it &quot;requires detailed investigation to
      determine whether it is useful and practical&quot;. The rationale of this study is to provide an
      overwhelming case for a straightforward and rapid clinical adoption of our MRI test, which
      will change our ability to confirm or refute the diagnosis of MS.

      Radiologists and neurologists can also readily interpret our proposed CVS using a simple
      'rule of six' that was described in a previous study. This involves the detection of any six
      lesions with a central vein present. This rule has the potential to be easily implemented in
      clinical practice if it has superior diagnostic sensitivity, when compared to lumbar puncture
      results.

      If the CVS can be shown to have superior diagnostic sensitivity at first presentation of MS,
      when compared to performing a lumbar puncture, then lumbar punctures can be avoided in many
      patients. These patients will benefit in several ways. The patients will avoid a procedure
      that is often painful or unpleasant. Those who currently refuse to have lumbar puncture will
      benefit from expedited diagnosis, limiting their anxiety and uncertainty. A secure diagnosis
      could lead to more rapid treatment decisions and a better long-term prognosis. In addition,
      fewer workdays will be lost attending hospital for investigation. From the NHS' perspective,
      it would avoid day case hospital admissions for lumbar punctures and readmissions to treat
      the common complication of post lumbar puncture headaches. This would create significant cost
      savings, when considering the significant number of patients undergoing this diagnostic
      process.
