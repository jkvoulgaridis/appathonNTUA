  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to assess whether dietary restriction with enteral
      nutrition prescribed could prevent nonadherence to dietary restrictions, enable additional
      reduction of the required volume of PEG-ELS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation plays a vital role in the quality of colonoscopy.Bowel preparation consists
      of 2 key steps: dietary restriction and purgative ingestion.Two liters of PEG-ELS are widely
      used in Asian countries, but in a well-designed clinical trial，additional reduction of
      PEG-ELS volume seems feasible. Enteral nutrition may simplify the process and avoid
      unexpected intake of fiber-containing food.

      We hypothesized that dietary restriction with enteral nutrition prescribed could prevent
      nonadherence to dietary restrictions, enable additional reduction of the required volume of
      PEG-ELS.

    <measure>the quality of bowel preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the quality of bowel preparation for each participant by the Ottawa bowel preparation scale(OBPS)，it's a validated scoring system with scores between 0 and 14, where 0 is the best score，The score comprises a sub score 0-4 for each colon segment: right, transverse and rectosigmoid colon.n addition, a score 0-2 is added to indicate the total amount of luminal fluid.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patients' satisfaction with the process of bowel preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the procedure, the patients were asked about the satisfaction with the process of bowel preparation. Satisfaction includes bad，not so bad and good.Bad means that the patient is not satisfied with the program, not so bad means that the patient is satisfied with the plan, and good means that the patient is very satisfied with the plan.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patients' willingness to have the colonoscopy done again at this facility in the future</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>It represent participants who wanted to choose the same protocol in the future as they received in this trial.Including yes and no two options, if yes, indicating that the patient is willing to undergo colonoscopy again, if no, indicating that the patient is reluctant to undergo colonoscopy again.</description>

    <measure>comparison with previous experience</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>If patients with colonoscopy times ≥ 2, they need to compare with previous experience，Including better than last experience, similar to the last experience, and worse than the last experience.</description>
