  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is a vulnerable period for both a mother and her developing child. The investigator
      hypothesizes that diet-induced glucose excursions in the pregnant mother are a key
      contributor to unfavourable brain development and epigenetic marks in the developing child.
      It is long known that metabolic conditions are influenced by maternal nutrition and that this
      can impact the unborn infant. The most prominent example is gestational diabetes (GDM). It is
      unclear at what point unfavourable changes in brain development occur during pregnancy.
      Unlike many previous trials, we plan to introduce healthy diet early in the first trimester.
      Comparative analyses of DNA methylation patterns in the offspring of women with or without
      GDM revealed preferentially methylated genes, particularly in pathways linked to metabolic
      diseases.

      NuPreGDM is a randomized, controlled, open label intervention trail. The investigator aims to
      assess the effect of individual diet counselling combined with CGM compared to regular diet
      on glucose levels and postprandial glycemic excursions during an OGTT in pregnancy.

      The investigator wants to assess the effect of dietary counselling combined with continuous
      glucose monitoring on GDM risk, glycaemia and pregnancy outcome, starting in the first
      trimester. The investigator further hypothesizes that improved glucose levels by a healthy
      diet will affect brain activity of the infant and prevent unfavourable epigenetic
      modifications.

      The investigator plans to include 50 pregnant women within gestational week 4 and 14 after
      the last menstruation, with elevated risk for development of (GDM). Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to either &quot;diet modification group&quot; (intervention) or to &quot;standard diet group&quot;
      (control). In the current trial, the investigator aims to modulate maternal metabolism with
      periodic personalized diet counselling on the basis of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
      compared to regular diet throughout pregnancy. The investigator propose that a reduction in
      glucose excursions in the mother will lead to a healthy environment for the developing child
      and prevent altered brain activity in utero, which will be assessed by fMEG (fetal
      magnetoencephalography) during a 75g OGTT in gestational week 28. The investigator further
      planned to examine child's leucocytes from cord blood to assess whether a healthy diet of the
      mother prevented epigenetic alterations due to improved maternal glycaemia, as exploratory
      endpoint. The development of blood sugar levels of the mother postpartum will be assessed by
      an further OGTT 6-12 weeks postpartum.
