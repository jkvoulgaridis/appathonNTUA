  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate 5 doses of RPL554 and placebo, administered by
      dry powder inhaler (DPI), in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD).

      The study will consist of two parts. Part A is a parallel group, placebo-controlled single
      dose study to ascertain the Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, safety and bronchodilator effect
      of RPL554 administered via dry powder inhaler (DPI). Five of the 6 treatment arms will be
      double-blind and one will be single-blind (due to the different number of capsules
      administered). Part B is a placebo-controlled, complete block cross-over, repeat dose study
      to assess the bronchodilator effect of repeat doses of RPL554 delivered via a DPI.
