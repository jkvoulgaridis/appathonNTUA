  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether Provodine, an FDA approved product, provides
      long-lasting protection on the hands of staff who provide anesthesia for patients. If this
      product does provide long-lasting protection, it could be used for hand hygiene in the
      operating room and it could help prevent infections after operations. Fifteen anesthesia
      providers (15 main operating room [MOR] and 5 ambulatory surgery center [ASC]) who agree to
      participate will participate in the pre-intervention and intervention periods. During the
      pre-intervention or baseline period, the investigators will do bag broth cultures of
      anesthesia providers' hands just before the start of their first case of the day . The
      participants will then rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium. The
      investigators will also obtain cultures after the first case of the day, and after the second
      case. During the intervention period (ProvodineTM; usual hand hygiene practice), the
      investigators obtain hand cultures from the same anesthesia providers at the beginning of the
      day. The participants will then then do a hand scrub with ProvodineTM. The investigators will
      obtain a second hand culture at this point and participants will rinse and dry their hands to
      remove the culture medium and then apply a small amount of ProvodineTM as a hand rub. The
      investigators will obtain cultures after the first case of the day, and after the second case
      of the day. If participants are still providing anesthesia to their second case 6 hours after
      they applied ProvodineTM, the participants will apply a small of ProvodineTM amount as a hand
      rub at this time.

      For anesthesia providers in the ASC, the investigators will use the same protocol with the
      following exception. Because cases are likely to be shorter, the investigators will obtain
      the final cultures after the last case of the day or after the case that ends closest to 6
      hours after ProvodineTM was applied in the morning.

      During the pre-intervention or baseline period, the investigators will do bag broth cultures
      of anesthesia providers' hands just before the start of their first case of the day (n =25).
      The participants will then rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium. The
      investigators will also obtain cultures after the first case of the day (n = 25), and after
      the second case (n = 25). During the intervention period (ProvodineTM; usual hand hygiene
      practice), the investigators obtain hand cultures from the same anesthesia providers at the
      beginning of the day (n =25). The participants will then then do a hand scrub with
      ProvodineTM. The investigators will obtain a second hand culture at this point and
      participants will rinse and dry their hands to remove the culture medium and then apply a
      small amount of ProvodineTM as a hand rub (n =25). The investigators will obtain cultures
      after the first case of the day (n = 25), and after the second case of the day (n = 25). If
      participants are still providing anesthesia to their second case 6 hours after they applied
      ProvodineTM, the participants will apply a small of ProvodineTM amount as a hand rub at this
      time. For anesthesia providers in the ASC, the investigators will use the same protocol with
      the following exception. Because cases are likely to be shorter, the investigators will
      obtain the final cultures after the last case of the day or after the case that ends closest
      to 6 hours after ProvodineTM was applied in the morning.

      The study procedures will occur on two different work days for the participants: one for the
      control day and one for the intervention day. The study procedures will be done by the end of
      these two working days. There is no long-term followup.

    <description>Each subject of the study will serve as their own controls and a comparison will be made between the control phase of the study and the intervention phase of the study.
Control portion of the study-usual hand hygiene practice but prior to the anesthesiologist's first case of the day, bag broth cultures will be obtained and the number of CFU's will be counted (T1).
Interventional phase of the study-usual hand hygiene and bag broth culture collection (T1) followed with a hand scrub using ProvodineTM. A second bag broth culture is collected (T1a).</description>
