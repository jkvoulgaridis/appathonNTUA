    <textblock>
      A prospective study will be conducted in patients with COPD. The investigators will suggest
      about intervention for preventing in recurrence and aggravation of adult chronic respiratory
      disease due to exposure to particulate matter.

    <description>For the intervention group, specific guidance is given to the patient who might be exposure in environment with higher particulate matter concentration.
1) Start air purifier
2) Do not go out and make it to the minimum when absolutely necessary
3) It is recommended to wear a mask when going out.
4) The investigators recommend a lot of water, fresh fruit and vegetables.
5) Prepare an inhaler and use it when symptoms get worse.</description>
