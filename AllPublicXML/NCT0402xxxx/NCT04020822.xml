      The purpose of Phase 3 Group is to evaluate the impact of acetaminophen on the performance of
      Guardian Sensor (3) during 11 days of wear (approximately 264 hours) in subjects with insulin
      requiring diabetes,18-75 years of age.

      The study is a multi-center, prospective single-arm design without controls. All subjects
      will be assigned to treatment for 11 days of sensor wear. Each subject will wear 4 Guardian
      Sensor (3)s, and each will be connected to a Guardian Link (3) Transmitter and/or Guardian
      Connect Transmitter. Subjects will not use sensor glucose values for diabetes management.

      On days 1, 3, 5, and 6, subjects will be asked to measure blood glucose (BG) using a home
      glucose meter approximately every 20 minutes for 5 hours. Subjects will be asked to take one
      gram of acetaminophen orally on days 3, 5, and 6 of sensor wear.

      On day 11, devices will be removed, data uploaded from the study meter and transmitter or
      recorder, skin assessment will be performed, and the subject's participation in the study
      will be completed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18-75 years of age at time of screening

          2. A clinical diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes as determined by investigator, for
             at least the last 12 months

          3. Subject is using insulin to treat their diabetes

          4. Subject agrees to comply with the study protocol requirements

          5. Subject is willing to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose approximately every 20
             minutes during FST

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has history of allergy to acetaminophen or has been told by health care
             provider they may not ingest acetaminophen

          2. Subject reports history of liver cirrhosis or problems with liver that a health care
             provider told them they should not use acetaminophen because of liver disorder.

          3. Subject is unable to tolerate tape adhesive in the area of sensor placement

          4. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of sensor or device
             placement (e.g. psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)

          5. Subject is actively participating in or plans to enroll in an investigational study
             (drug or device), other than this study, wherein they have received treatment from an
             investigational drug or device

          6. Subject has a positive urine pregnancy test at time of screening

          7. Subject is female, sexually active without the use of contraception, able to become
             pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study
