  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multinational study of cerdulatinib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory PTCL dosed with cerdulatinb, designed to (1) Evaluate tumor response, (2)
      Assess the safety and tolerability of cerdulatinib, (3) Evaluate duration of response (DUR),
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS), (4) Determine the PK properties of
      cerdulatinib, (5) Evaluate the efficacy endpoints based on Lugano criteria per IRC and (6)To
      assess the relationship between target expression (e.g., spleen tyrosine kinase [SYK], Janus
      kinase [JAK]) and relevant anomalies (e.g., SYK-ITK translocation, mutations in the JAK/STAT
      pathway) with clinical response.

             pathology. Local pathology slides must be available for central pathology review.

          3. Prior therapy consisting of at least one systemic regimen that involved at least two
             cycles of treatment.

          4. In patients with ALCL, prior treatment with brentuximab vendotin unless, in the

          5. Relapsed/refractory disease after prior therapy:

               -  Refractory is defined as progression during treatment or recurrence/progression
                  of disease within ≤ 6 months of completing a treatment regimen that resulted in
                  either SD, a PR, or a CR.

               -  Relapse is defined as progression or recurrence of disease after a prior
                  documented response (CR or PR) and &gt; 6 months since last treatment.

          6. Age ≥ 18 years.

          7. A life expectancy of &gt; 3 months.

          9. Adequate bone marrow reserve, defined as an ANC ≥ 1,000/µL and a platelet count ≥
             75,000/µL. The ANC must be without growth factor support for 7 days, and the platelet

             Patients with evidence of marrow involvement must have a platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL.

             NOTE: There are no limits on ANC or platelet count for patients with HSTCL as long as
             cytopenia, if present, is secondary to disease.

         10. Adequate renal function, defined as a creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min calculated

             serum AST/ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × the ULN for the reference lab. A serum bilirubin level ≤
             2.5 mg/dL is permissible if it is clearly due to Gilbert's syndrome. In patients with
             lymphoma and documented hepatic involvement, adequate hepatic function is defined as:
             i) total bilirubin level ≤ 2 × ULN; and ii) AST/ALT levels ≤ 3 × ULN.

             contraception include oral contraceptives or double barrier methods such as a condom
             plus spermicide or a condom plus a diaphragm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of any one of the following PTCL subtypes: (i) primary cutaneous T-cell
