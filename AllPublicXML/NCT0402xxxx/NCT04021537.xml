  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People often have difficulty sleeping. Reasons are many. But, difficulty falling and staying
      asleep are common issues. Sleep difficulties are common in disorders such as Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder. Current treatments for sleep difficulties are not effective for everyone.
      Better treatments are needed. In this study, the investigators are testing two nerve
      stimulation locations that may impact brain function in such a way that sleep is improved.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The investigators are using a blinding box with a code entry system that determines which stimulation location is used. The study coordinator/care providers will know the code, but not the stimulation location. Participants will know the stimulation location (they can feel it) but not which location is the investigators' hypothesized actor (i.e., they don't which is sham and which is target). The investigators will not know which is which until the data are in analyzable form.</masking_description>
