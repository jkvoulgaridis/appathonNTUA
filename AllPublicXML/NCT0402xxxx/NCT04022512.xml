  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma is regarded as most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents.
      Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with osteosarcoma present with detectable metastatic
      disease, and the majority of whom (85%) have pulmonary lesions as the sole site of
      metastasis. Previous studies have shown that the overall survival rate among patients with
      localized osteosarcoma without metastatic disease is approximately 60% to 70% whereas
      survival rate reduces to 10% to 30% in patients with metastatic disease. Though lately,
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens can decline the mortality rate, 30% to 50%
      of patients still die of pulmonary metastases. Number, distribution and timing of lung
      metastases are of prognostic value for survival and hence computed tomography (CT) thorax
      imaging still plays a vital role in disease surveillance. In the last decade, the technology
      of multidetector CT scanner has enhanced the detection of numerous smaller lung lesions,
      which on one hand can increase the diagnostic sensitivity for lung metastasis, however, the
      specificity may be reduced. In recent years, deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI)
      algorithm in a wide variety of imaging examinations is a hot topic. Currently, an increasing
      number of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems based on deep learning technologies aiming
      for faster screening and correct interpretation of pulmonary nodules have been rapidly
      developed and introduced into the market. So far, the researches concentrating on the
      improving the accuracy of benign/malignant nodule classification have made substantial
      progress, inspired by tremendous advancement of deep learning techniques. Consequently, the
      majority of the existing CAD systems can perform pulmonary nodule classification with
      accuracy of 90% above. In clinical practice, not only the malignancy determination for
      pulmonary nodule, but also the distinction between primary carcinoma and intrapulmonary
      metastasis is crucial for patient management. However, most existing classification of
      pulmonary nodule applied in CAD system remains to be binary pattern (benign Vs malignant), in
      the lack of more thorough nodule classification characterized with splitting of primary and
      metastatic nodule. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have focuses on the
      performance of deep learning-based CAD system for identifying metastatic pulmonary nodule
      till now. In this proposed study, the investigators sought to determine the accuracy and
      sensitivity of one computer-aided system based on deep-learning artificial intelligence
      algorithm for detection and risk stratification of lung nodules in osteogenic sarcoma
      patients.

        This is a single institutional retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with
        osteogenic sarcoma between the year 2000 and 2018. All patients' data will be retrieved via
        the electronic patient database of our institution. Patient demographics, imaging and
        histological data, disease and treatment history will be recorded, including age at onset,
        details of chemotherapy, time interval of pulmonary metastasis from diagnosis, surgery for
        the primary bony tumor, subsequent pulmonary metastatectomy if performed, the length of
        survival, clinical outcome and so on.
