  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the development of gastrointestinal health in terms of digestive
      tolerability and immune-inflammatory response at the intestinal level comparing a
      conventional gluten-free cereal with a new cereal with prebiotics, probiotics and a very
      moderate amount of gluten. These are products adapted to infant feeding since 4 Months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2008 the ESPGHAN recommended not to give gluten cereals before 4 months but not after 7
      months. Although the introduction of gluten in this window was linked to a posible preventive
      effect on celiac disease, the truth is that it has not been demonstrated. In any case, high
      exposures to gluten since the 4 months have been associated with a higher incidence of celiac
      disease and current recommendations propose moderate and progressive exposure to gluten
      between 4 and 6 months old.
