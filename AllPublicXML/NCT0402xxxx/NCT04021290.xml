  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if virologically suppressed Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV) Type 1 infected adults on a current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) (including 2
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus a third agent) remain suppressed
      upon switching to dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) fixed dose combination (FDC). The main
      objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to
      DTG/3TC FDC once daily compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks in virologically
      suppressed adults living with HIV-1. The study will also evaluate information regarding the
      safety and health related quality of life. The study will include Screening Phase (up to 28
      days), a Randomization Phase (up to Week 52) and a Continuation Phase (post Week 52). The
      Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. Approximately
      490 participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive DTG/3TC FDC once daily for up to
      52 weeks or continue their CAR for 52 weeks. Participants in the DTG/3TC FDC arm who
      successfully complete up to 52 weeks of treatment will have the opportunity to continue
      receiving DTG/3TC FDC once daily in Continuation Phase.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized study with parallel group assignment where participants will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups. Participants randomized to DTG/3TC FDC will receive DTG/3TC FDC up to Week 52. Participants randomized to CAR will continue to take their current regimen up to Week 52. Randomization will be stratified by Baseline third agent class (protease inhibitor [PI], integrase inhibitor [INI], or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]).</intervention_model_description>

             i) Any prior switch, defined as a change of a single drug or multiple drugs
             simultaneously, must have occurred due to tolerability and/or safety concerns or
             access to medications, or convenience/simplification and must not have been done for

          -  Any evidence of major NRTI mutation or presence of any DTG resistance-associated
             mutation in any available prior resistance genotype assay test result, if known.

          -  Participants with any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality, with the exception of
             Grade 4 lipid abnormalities. A single repeat test is allowed during the Screening
             period to verify a result.

          -  Participants with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;= 5 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN) or ALT &gt;= 3 times ULN and bilirubin &gt;= 1.5 times ULN (with &gt;35 percent direct
             bilirubin).

          -  Participants with creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m^2 via Chronic Kidney
             Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) method. Participants with creatinine
             clearance between 30 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m^2 are eligible after the medical monitor has
             provided approval after reviewing participant's current ART regimen.

          -  Participants with any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would preclude the participant'sparticipation in the study of an
             investigational compound.

          -  Participants within the 12 month window prior to Screening and after confirmed
             suppression to &lt;50 c/mL, any plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement &gt;200 c/mL.

          -  Participants within the 12 month window prior to Screening and after confirmed
             suppression to &lt;50 c/mL, 2 or more consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements &gt;=50
             c/mL. A single plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement &gt;50 c/mL but less than 200 c/mL, with
             confirmation of return to &lt;50 c/mL is allowed.

          -  Any history of switch to another regimen, defined as change of a single drug or
             multiple drugs simultaneously, due to virologic failure to therapy (defined as a
             confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;=400 c/mL).

          -  Participants with any drug holiday during the 6 months prior to Screening, except for
             brief periods (less than 1 month) where all ART was stopped due to tolerability and/or
             safety concerns.

          -  Participants who are currently participating in or anticipate to be selected for any
             other interventional study after randomization.

          -  Participants enrolled in France (or in other countries as required by local
             regulations or Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board [IRB]) who participated in
             any study using an investigational drug or vaccine during the previous 60 days or 5
             half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the experimental drug or
             vaccine, whichever is longer, prior to screening for the study, or participate
             simultaneously in another clinical study.
