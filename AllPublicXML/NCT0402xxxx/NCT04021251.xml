  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral raman data paired with validated
      glucose reference values in private homes of subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will collect either 8 or 44 daily optical raman readings paired with either 8
      capillary Blood Glucose comparator or 8 capillary Blood Glucose comparator plus 44 readings
      using a flash glucose monitoring system in own home with maintaining usual routines. Subjects
      will either collect data for 5 days during a 10 days period or collect data for 90 days
      during a 40 days period or collect data for 90 days during 6 months period.
