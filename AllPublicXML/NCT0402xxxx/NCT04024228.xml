  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that QIV-HD induces an immune response that is superior to the responses
      induced by QIV-SD for all 4 virus strains 28 days post-vaccination in subjects 60 to 64 years
      of age and in subjects 65 years of age and older.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To further describe the immune response induced by QIV-HD and QIV-SD in all subjects by
           age group, in pooled age groups, and by vaccine group (QIV-HD; QIV-SD).

        -  To describe the safety profile of all subjects by age group, in pooled age groups, and
           by vaccine group (QIV-HD; QIV-SD).

      Study duration per participant will be approximately 6 months including: 1 day of screening
      and vaccination, an end of study visit and safety follow-up telephone call approximately at
      Day 28 and Day 180 after vaccination, respectively.
