  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point-of care-ultrasonography has the potential to transform healthcare delivery through its
      diagnostic and therapeutic utility. Its use has become more widespread across a variety of
      clinical settings as more investigations have demonstrated its impact on patient care. This
      includes the use of point-of-care ultrasound by trainees, who are now utilizing this
      technology as part of their diagnostic assessments of patients. However, there are few
      studies that examine how efficiently trainees can learn point-of-care ultrasound and which
      training methods are more effective. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether
      handheld ultrasound devices, along with a year-long lecture series, improve internal medicine
      interns' knowledge and image interpretation skills with point-of-care ultrasound.
      Participants shall be randomized to receive personal access to handheld ultrasound devices to
      be used for learning vs. no personal access. The primary outcome will assess their
      interpretive ability with ultrasound images/videos. Secondary outcomes will include rates of
      device usage and lecture attendance.
