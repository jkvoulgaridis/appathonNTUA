  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation (MV) have pain, anxiety, sleep
      deprivation and agitation. The use of analgesics and sedatives drugs (sedoanalgesia) is a
      common practice to produce pain relief and comfort during the VM. Despite its usefulness, it
      has been documented that the excessive use of sedatives is associated with an increased risk
      of prolonging the stay under MV and in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). To avoid this, current
      evidence suggests the use of protocols guided to clinical goals, such as the
      sedation-agitation scale (SAS), or daily suspension of infusions to avoid excess sedation.
      These protocols minimize the prescription of deep sedation, which is still necessary for
      20-30% of patients.

      Monitoring of sedation with electroencephalography in the ICU has been underutilized. In
      fact, only the use of indices that are generated from algorithms of the
      electroencephalographic signal processing has been reported. However, it has been shown that
      the use of these monitoring systems does not benefit the heterogeneous groups of patients in
      MV. Currently, the clinical monitors used to measure the effect of drugs used in a
      sedoanalgesia show in the screen the spectrogram of the brain electrical signal and quantify
      the frequency under which 95% of the electroencephalographic power is located, known as
      spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95). This value in a person who is conscious is usually
      greater than 20 Hz, in a patient undergoing general anesthesia it is between 10 and 15 Hz. In
      preliminary measurements, in deeply sedated patients in the ICU, SEF95 values are under 5 Hz.
      This would indicate that patients in the ICU are being overdosed. It is unknown if in cases
      with an indication of deep sedation, the use of monitoring by spectrogram is superior to the
      standard management guided at clinical scales, such as SAS.

      Therefore, the investigators propose the following hypothesis: In patients with an
      appropriate indication of deep sedation (SAS 1-2), the sedoanalgesia guided by the spectral
      edge frequency 95 reduces the consumption of propofol compared to the deep sedoanalgesia
      guided by the sedation scale agitation in MV patients in the ICU maintaining a clinically
      adequate level of sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether deep sedoanalgesia guided by the spectral edge frequency 95 decreases
      propofol consumption with respect to deep sedoanalgesia guided by the sedation-agitation
      scale in patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit under mechanical ventilation.

        -  Group intervention: sedation will be guided by SEF95 and SAS. Patients will be sedated
           to keep a SAS 1-2 with a SEF95 between 10 to 13 Hz.

        -  Group control: sedation will be guided by SAS. However, SEF95 will be also recorded but
           covered.

If clinical indication is a deep sedation, then the patient must reach a SAS 1-2. If clinical indication is a light sedation, then the patient must reach a SAS 3-4. Scores of 5, 6 and 7 must be avoided with drugs.</description>
