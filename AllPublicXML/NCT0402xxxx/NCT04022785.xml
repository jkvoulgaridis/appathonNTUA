      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PLX51107 and how well it works
      with azacitidine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome. PLX51107 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving PLX51107 and azacitidine may work better than
      azacitidine alone in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the minimum safe and biologically-effective dose of the combination of
      PLX51107 and azacitidine (AZA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall response rate (ORR) rate including CR (complete remission) + CRp
      (complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery) + CRi (complete remission with
      incomplete count recovery) + CRh (complete remission with partial hematologic recovery),
      partial remission (PR) within 3 months of treatment initiation of PLX51107 and AZA
      combination in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To investigate correlations of response to this combination with a pre-therapy,
      on-therapy, and progression 81-gene panel of gene mutations in AML.

      III. To determine the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival
      (OS), and number of patients bridged to stem cell transplant (SCT) and median duration to SCT
      from the initiation of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PLX51107.

      Patients receive PLX51107 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and azacitidine
      subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 8-14 and 22-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6-12
      months for 5 years.

                  rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and
                  for the first four weeks on therapy. These medications will be recorded in the
