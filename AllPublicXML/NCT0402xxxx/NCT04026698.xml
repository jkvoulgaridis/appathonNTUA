    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot test of an intervention to engage residents and their family and the
      healthcare team in a collaborative approach to decisions about care planning in long-term
      care. The intervention includes leadership coaching with the management team, an educational
      bundle that includes a one-day education session for staff and managers on communication
      strategies and ways to engage family and residents in care planning and follow-up visits, and
      a series of resident and family led huddles (brief, 15 minute meetings) to discuss something
      important with staff to foster proactive communication and information sharing.

      This study is a pilot test of an intervention to engage residents and their family and the
      healthcare team in a collaborative approach to decisions about care planning in long-term
      care. The intervention includes leadership coaching with the management team, an educational
      bundle that includes a one-day education session for staff and managers on communication
      strategies and ways to engage family and residents in care planning and follow-up visits, and
      a series of resident and family led huddles (brief, 15 minute meetings) to discuss something
      important with staff to foster proactive communication and information sharing.

      The study aims are to describe the feasibility and acceptability of the resident and family
      engagement intervention, and to evaluate the following outcomes: resident quality of life,
      resident and family satisfaction with care, and staff quality of work life. The investigators
      aim to recruit 20 staff, the leadership team, and 12 resident-family dyads from four
      long-term care facilities who will receive the intervention and complete the survey measures.
      The expected outcome from this study is an increased understanding of how to engage residents
      and family in care decisions impacting quality of life.

    <description>The dementia quality of life DEMQOL (28-items) and DEMQOL-Proxy (31-items) are measures that assess health-related quality of life of people with dementia. The questions are interviewer-administered to obtain self (person with dementia) and caregiver perspectives. Response options range from 1=a lot to 4=not at all (with higher scores indicating a higher perceived health-related quality of life). A total score is calculated by summing scores from the 28 items (minimum score 28, maximum score 112).</description>

    <measure>Resident satisfaction with care- a change is being assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 12 weeks, and at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resident satisfaction with care will be assessed using the Resident Satisfaction with the Nursing Home questionnaire, a 29-item measure that has been used with residents with cognitive impairment. The questions are interviewer-administered to obtain self-reported data from the resident using Yes/No response options (with a Yes response indicating satisfaction).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, at 12 weeks, and at 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Family satisfaction with resident care will be assessed using the Nursing Facility Family Satisfaction Questionnaire, a 20-item measure that uses a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).</description>

    <description>The leadership coaching component targets managers, administrators/ directors of care in long-term care settings. These sessions involve selecting a subset of relevant performance outcomes from the quality improvement plan that align with leadership vision and priorities for staff performance which leaders can monitor, reinforce and encourage.
The education component involves a one-day in-person training session for staff and managers on communication strategies and ways to engage family and residents in care planning, and includes follow-up visits.
The huddle component involves a series of resident and family led huddles (brief, 15 minute meetings) to discuss something important with staff to foster proactive communication and information sharing. Resident-family dyads will participate in the huddles, along with the staff and management team who received the training. The huddles will be scheduled for 15 minutes once/month for 6 months.</description>
