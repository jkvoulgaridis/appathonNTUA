      Study was aimed to compare the effect of ketofol between 6:1 and 4:1 ratio in patients who
      underwent ERCP

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination of propofol and ketamine (ketofol) has been used as a medication for sedation in
      various medical procedures such as Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).
      The addition of ketamine to propofol may counteract the effect of respiratory and
      cardiovascular depression of propofol. There has been limited studies evaluating the sedation
      effect of different ketofol dose ratios associated with hemodynamic changes, recovery time,
      dose and side effect. Thus, the study was aimed to compare the effect of ketofol between 6:1
      and 4:1 ratio in patients who underwent ERCP

    <description>Patients in K61 group received propofol and ketamine in a ratio of 6:1. The 6:1 ketofol mixture was made by mixing 30 mL of 1% propofol (10 mg/mL) and 1 mL of ketamine (50 mg/ml), then 19 mL of 0.9% NaCl was added until the volume of the mixture was 50 mL. The 4:1 ketofol mixture was made by combining 20 mL of 1% propofol (10 mg/mL) and 1 mL ketamine (50 mg/ml). Afterward, 29 mL of 0.9% NaCl was added until the volume of mixture was 50 mL. Mixtures were mixed in a 50 mL syringe and were given to patients through a syringe pump (B Braun).</description>
