  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DP regimen, low-dose decitabine combined with SHR-1210, is the new treatment for relapsed
      or refractory classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Though the CR rate of this regimen is
      impressively high, which is verified more than 70% in our I/II phase study, there are also
      lots of patients cannot benefit from this treatment. On top of that, as the increasing
      utilization of mono-therapy or combination treatment with the immune checkpoint blockade
      (ICB), the adverse reactions associated with immunotherapy make it unavailable in parts of
      patients. The application of MOAP regimen to patients, who have a progressive disease after
      DP regimen, can bring high CR rate. MOAP can be the a rescue treatment for cHL resisted to DP
      treatment.
