  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators will examine whether text messages sent to Veterans will
      help support in meeting nutrition or physical activity health goals. One group will get the
      text messages only and a second group will receive the text messages combined with two calls
      from a Veteran peer health coach who will support participants in meeting goals. The
      investigators will therefore examine whether or not the addition of a health coach promotes
      goal-related health outcomes.

      Trial is suspended due to COVID-19.

      Using the VET-C cohort, the investigators are preparing to conduct a two-group randomized
      pilot trial evaluating Veterans who receive automated text messaging (comparison group)
      compared to those who receive automated text messaging plus health coaching support
      (intervention group). Completion of this pilot trial will provide preliminary insights
      regarding efficacy and feasibility and help understand whether and how health coaching
      enhances the effect of an automated texting system on outcomes. It will also provide data on
      how best to incorporate health coaching into the adoption and use of connected care
      technologies for health behavior and behavior change.
