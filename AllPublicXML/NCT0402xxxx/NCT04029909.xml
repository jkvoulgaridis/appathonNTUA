    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation ,and multidose study, aiming to investigate
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Gimatecan in Advanced Ovarian Epithelial
      Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer. To explore the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of oral administration of Gimatecan
      capsules 5 consecutive days, every 28 days.

      The clinical trial is used the traditional 3 +3 design and conducted in two dose groups,
      0.6mg/m2/d and 0.8mg/m2/d, with an improved dose escalation design. The initial dose is
      0.6mg/m2, once a day for 5 consecutive days, every 28 days for a course of treatment.
      Subjects are assigned to the corresponding dose group according to the order of enrolling.
      DLT is observed within 28 days of the first dose of Gimatecan. In the absence of DLT as
      prescribed by the protocol, the next dose group is started until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is observed.
