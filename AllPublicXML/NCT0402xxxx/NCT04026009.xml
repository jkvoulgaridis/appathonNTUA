  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate safety, reactogenicity (assessment of any expected
      or unexpected side effect of the vaccine) and immunogenicity (ability to provoke an immune
      response in the body) data for the development of a candidate Clostridium difficile (C.
      difficile) vaccine that would protect against primary cases of Clostridium difficile
      infection (CDI) and CDI recurrence.

      Clostridium difficile infection is a major cause of gastrointestinal illness with
      approximately 500,000 infections and the leading cause of gastroenteritis associated death
      with 29,000 deaths annually in the United States of America (USA). The emergence of extremely
      infectious varieties/types of C. difficile has contributed to increase the number and
      severity of CDI cases. In recent years, some countries (United Kingdom) have implemented
      hospital hygiene and other measures which resulted in significant reductions in the number of
      cases. The burden is, however, expected to remain significant until vaccination is available.

    <intervention_model_description>A 4-step staggered design will be used to ensure maximum safety of the participating subjects:
Step 1:Vaccination of approximately 20 subjects aged 18-45 years. An internal safety review committee (iSRC) will review all accumulating safety data after Dose 1 and 2. If considered appropriate to proceed, Step 2 will start.
Step 2:Vaccination of approximately 20 subjects aged 50-70 years. An iSRC will review all accumulating safety data after Dose 1 and 2. If considered appropriate to proceed, Step 3 will start.
Step 3:Vaccination of approximately 30 subjects aged 50-70 years.An iSRC will review all accumulating safety data after Dose 1 and 2. If considered appropriate to proceed, Step 4 will start.
Step 4:Vaccination of approximately 70 subjects aged 50-70 years.An iSRC will review all accumulating safety data 3 weeks after the start of vaccination in Step 4 and then about every 3 weeks until all subjects have received Dose 1.In addition, the iSRC will review all safety data after Dose 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This is a randomized, observer-blind study. Given the different appearance of the C. difficile investigational vaccines and placebo, double blinding is not possible, and the study will be conducted in an observer blind manner. In an observer blind study, the subject, the Contract Research Organization personnel, and the study center and Sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the subjects are blinded while other study personnel may be aware of the treatment assignment.
When all data up to Day 61 are available, a statistical analysis will be performed. This analysis may lead to the unblinding of some subjects. A statistician will be unblinded for the analysis. The study will be considered as single blind from this point onwards. The remaining study personnel will stay blinded until study end.
The Investigator and the subjects will not have access to the treatment allocation up to study end (Day 390).</masking_description>

             study vaccine.

         10. Planned elective surgery during the study period.

         11. Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product.
