      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on driving performance of a single dose of
      amphetamine extended-release tablets (20 mg/tablet) compared with placebo at 45 minutes and
      10 hours post-dose in young adults with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At a single US-based study site, a driving simulation will be used to assess the effect on
      driving performance for the co-primary endpoints, study subjects' driving performance at 45
      minutes and 10 hours post-dose, compared with placebo. Eligible subjects will be prescreened
      for ADHD but otherwise healthy, aged 18-25 years.

      Driving simulations that simulate common driving events to which the study subject must
      react. The reactions to each event will be assessed. Using a parallel-group design, subjects
      will be assessed while on study drug, and while on placebo.

      Safety assessments will include spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events and
      vital signs at 4 hours post-dose.

             surgery) at Screening based upon clinical assessment of the Investigator

          3. Diagnosed with ADHD using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
             Version 5 (DSM-5) criteria based on ADHD module from the Mini-International
