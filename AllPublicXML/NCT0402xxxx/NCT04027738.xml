      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been reported to be effective for the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single intraarticular
      injection of PRP for the treatment of early knee OA.

      In a prospective trial with 6-month follow-up, patients with early knee OA were recruited and
      received a single intraarticular PRP injection. Several outcomes were measured.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the VAS pain score at 6 months. The patient rated the average severity of knee pain on knee movement over the previous week on a 0-100 mm VAS (0=no pain to 100=worst possible pain)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC, Likert Scale) is a 24-item questionnaire with 3 subscales measuring pain, stiffness, and physical function [17]. The patient answers the questions and then receives a cumulative score in each of the 3 areas (pain, 0-20; stiffness, 0-8; physical function, 0-68). Total score is 96 and higher scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lequesne index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lequesne index is used to assess severity of knee symptoms during the last week .It is validated and includes the measurement of pain (5 items), walking distance (2 items), and activities of daily living (4 items). Maximal score is 24 and higher scores represent worse function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single-leg stance test (SLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Single-leg stance test (SLS) is done by raising one foot up without touching it to the supported lower extremity with target knee and maintain balance for as long as possible. Each participant performed 3 trials, and the best result of the 3 trials was recorded</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to rate their treatment satisfaction compared to the preinjection condition, using a 100 mm VAS (0= completely dissatisfied, 100=completely satisfied)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>safety assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>during the study, for 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The safety assessment was based on adverse events reported by the patients during the study and physical findings by the evaluator at each follow-up. The occurrence of adverse events was recorded, including duration, action taken and outcome.</description>

    <description>The patients received a single 3-ml injection of PRP. Approximately 10-mL of venous blood was drawn from each patient and centrifuged using an Arthrex autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) kit (a low-leukocyte ACP system), spun at a speed of 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. The platelet concentration obtained was approximately 2-3 times greater than the baseline platelet concentration.</description>
