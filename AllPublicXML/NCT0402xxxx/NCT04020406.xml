  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibacterial properties of urea was tested against 35 isolates from ocular infections.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro susceptibility testing was performed with commercially available antibiotic discs,
      homemade urea discs saturated with urea solution at a concentration of 96 mmol. The weight of
      urea in one drop = 0.37 mg, in one ml = 10.34 mg (5 microliter/ disc) discs and combined
      discs (antibiotic discs to which urea solution was added). Combined discs provided better in
      vitro susceptibility results than antibiotics alone.

      Scanning electron micrographs of bacterial isolates incubated overnight with urea solution
      showed marked disruption of bacterial aggregative patterns and irregularities of their cell
      walls.

      Western blotting showed marked reduction in total proteins in bacterial isolates incubated
      overnight with urea solution. These findings may explain the possible mechanisms for
      antibacterial activity of urea solution as a result of protein denaturation.

    <description>Samples were both inoculated on Muller Agar (Sigma-Aldrich) plates and directly examined under the microscope using Gram stained smears. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37oC for 48 hrs.
Gram negative isolates were sub-cultured on MacConkey's, Eosin Methelyene Blue (EMB) and Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient (CLED) agar plates (Sigma-Aldrich). Gram positive isolates were sub-cultured on Mannitol Salt agar plates (Sigma-Aldrich).</description>
