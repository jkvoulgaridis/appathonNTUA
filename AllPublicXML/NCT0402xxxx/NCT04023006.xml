    <textblock>
      This observational clinical case series investigation will be conducted on approximately five
      (5) enrolled subjects at one (1) site in the US. Treatment of subjects encompasses all steps
      to fabricate new dentures for maxilla and/or mandible. The subjects will be followed 7-10
      days after final delivery of the denture

      This investigation is undertaken to evaluate the workflow and concomitant products to create
      full dentures by using additive manufacturing (AM) technology, i.e. Digital Light Processing™
      Technology (Carbon 3D) to restore fully edentulous jaws. The assessment includes quality of
      materials provided by Dentsply Sirona Lab by using printers for AM (M series, Carbon 3D 1089
      Mills Way, Redwood City, CA 94063). This assessment will be done by clinical review of the AM
      dentures on fit and quality. In addition, the evaluation includes a patient survey to assess
      current dentures and the new AM dentures with a subjective comparison of both.

      The target subjects are male or female, 18 years and older with the need of a full denture in
      one or both jaws, being completely edentulous. The newly fabricated denture is to replace an
      existing full denture. For this descriptive study, no minimum number of patients is defined,
      but to achieve a reasonable subject number, a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of ten (10)
      patients will be enrolled, i.e. ten to twenty (10-20) denture arches will be fabricated
      within this study.
