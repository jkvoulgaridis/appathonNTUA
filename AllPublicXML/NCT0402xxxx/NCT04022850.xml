  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The De-imFAR study aims to carry out and test a structured, evidence-based and theory
      informed process involving the main stakeholders (managers, professionals, patients and
      researches) for the design and roll-out of de-implementation strategies for reducing
      low-value pharmacological prescription, against the usual system-level procedures based on
      the principles of linear dissemination of &quot;Not-to-do&quot; guidelines and recommendations. In
      doing so, the De-imFAR project has identified two low-value pharmacological prescriptions
      object of study: The prescription of statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) and the prescription of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs). The present study refers to the
      first of the two areas.

      Aims

        1. To design and model in a collegiate way among the agents involved (professionals,
           patients, managers and researchers) a de-implementation strategies to favour the
           reduction and / or abandonment of low-value prescription of lipid-lowering drugs in
           primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This strategy will be designed using a
           systematic, comprehensive frameworks based on theory and evidence for the design of
           implementation strategies - the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Behavior
           Change Wheel (BCW), focused on addressing the main determinants (barriers and
           facilitators) of clinical practice of primary prevention of CVD and adapted to the
           specific context of primary care in Osakidetza-Basque Health System

        2. To evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the de-implementation
           strategy to reduce the low-value prescription of lipid-lowering drugs in primary
           prevention of cardiovascular disease, in accordance with the recommended clinical
           practice, as compared to the usual procedures of dissemination of clinical practice
           guidelines, focused in the distribution of materials, support tools and training in the
           reference group.

      Hypothesis The implementation strategy derived from the systematic process of identification
      of determinants and mapping of adapted interventions with the TDF framework, will be more
      effective in reducing and/or abandoning the prescription of statins in primary prevention of
      CVD, as compared to a strategy based on the procedures for diffusion of clinical practice
      guidelines (&quot;Do not&quot; recommendations) focused on the distribution of materials, support tools
      and training, in the reference group. Likewise, the exposure to the de-implementation
      strategy will increase the knowledge, will generate a more favorable attitude towards and
      increase the ability to perform health promotion actions of professionals.

      Design Phase I formative research to design and model de-implementation strategies and Phase
      II feasibility and potential effectiveness evaluation through a comparative hybrid
      feasibility/potential effectiveness trial. Phase I formative research will include the
      following actions: Cross-sectional observational study of low value pharmacological
      prescription in the primary prevention of CVD; Literature review on the determinants of low
      value pharmacological prescription behaviour and effective intervention strategies;
      Qualitative study on the determinants of low value pharmacological prescription in primary
      prevention of CVD; Collegiate mapping of the de-implementation strategies; Selection of
      de-implementation strategies based in perceived effectiveness and feasibility.

      The evaluation of at least one active de-implementation strategy produced through the phase I
      formative evaluation with respect with the usual procedures of dissemination of clinical
      practice guidelines (&quot;Not to do&quot; guidelines, focused in the distribution of materials,
      support tools and training) in a reference group will be conducted. A mixed methods
      evaluation will be used: quantitative for the results of implementation at professional level
      (process indicators with respect to the adoption, reach and implementation or execution of
      the recommended clinical practice) and qualitative methods to determine the viability and the
      perceived impact of the de-implementation strategy by health professionals, and the
      experience of patients related to the reception of clinical care.
