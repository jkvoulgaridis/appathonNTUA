  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of cusatuzumab in combination with
      azacitidine in participants with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are
      not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AML is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled clonal expansion of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells. As the most common form of acute leukemia, AML accounts for
      the largest number of annual deaths from leukemia. Over 95 percent (%) of AML blasts
      harvested from newly diagnosed AML participants expressed Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 70
      on the cell surface. Cusatuzumab (JNJ‑74494550) is a humanized monoclonal antibody of camelid
      origin, binding with tight affinity to human CD70. Cusatuzumab has been modified to induce
      enhanced antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity for therapeutic use in participants
      with cancer. Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine with antineoplastic
      activity and is indicated for the treatment of adult participants with AML or intermediate 2
      and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with greater than 20% marrow blasts who are not
      eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study will evaluate 2 doses of
      cusatuzumab in combination with standard dose azacitidine in participants with AML who are
      not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (Part 1). Part 1 data will be reviewed by a Data
      Review Committee to select a preferred dose of cusatuzumab. Participants will be enrolled
      into Part 2 at the selected cusatuzumab dose to further evaluate and confirm the response
      rate, other efficacy endpoints, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD).
      The study will include a Screening Phase (28 days prior to randomization), a Treatment Phase,
      and a Follow-up Phase. The study includes evaluations like vital signs, electrocardiogram,
      spirometry test, serum chemistry and hematology tests. The study will be conducted for an
      approximate duration of 2 years.
