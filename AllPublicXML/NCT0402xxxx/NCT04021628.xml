  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cCHIPS study is a feasibility study for larger scale multi-centre studies and is designed
      as a single-centre observational cohort, longitudinal, natural history study.

      The overarching aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing larger scale,
      multi-centre studies to evaluate the relationship between CMV shedding in pregnancy with
      congenital CMV (cCMV). There is no randomisation involved in this study and all participants
      will perform the same study procedures and receive treatment as usual.

      The primary (main) objective is to evaluate the prevalence (percentage of occurrence) of CMV
      shedding in saliva, urine and vaginal secretions of CMV seropositive women throughout
      pregnancy.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the quantity of CMV shedding in saliva, urine and
      vaginal secretions of CMV seropositive women throughout pregnancy, to compare the prevalence
      and quantity of CMV shedding in CMV seropositive women between different sources of shedding
      (saliva, urine or vaginal secretions) and different gestational stages, to identify risk
      factors for CMV shedding in CMV seropositive pregnant women, to evaluate the acceptability of
      the study procedures to the participating pregnant women, to evaluate the proportion of women
      approached who are recruited into the study and who are completing the study, and to evaluate
      the relationship between CMV specific cell mediated immunity (a type of immune protection
      following exposure to CMV) and CMV shedding in CMV seropositive pregnant women.

      The tertiary objective is to compare the evaluation of CMV specific T cell immune responses
      (a type of CMV specific cell mediated immunity) between the two commercially available
      CMV-specific T cell immune response assays which are QuantiFERON-CMV and CMV-ELISPOT assays.

      This study will aim to recruit 200 pregnant women.

      This study will be undertaken in parallel with a separate study called RACE-FIT (REC
      reference number 18/SC/0360, IRAS ID 239977), which will have ethical approval to screen
      pregnant women with children less than 4 years of age booked for their antenatal care at St
      George's Hospital, London, identified during the antenatal combined screening bloods
      appointment or the antenatal booking appointment, for their CMV serology status on a sample
      of blood collected as part of the screening process. As part of the ethical approval sought
      for the RACE-FIT study and the cCHIPS study, the pregnant women screened and found to be CMV
      seronegative will be eligible for recruitment into the RACE-FIT study and those screened and
      found to be CMV seropositive will be eligible and approached for recruitment into the cCHIPS
      study.

      The cCHIPS study aim to recruit over a 6 month period.

      The study involves four visits (Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4) for each participant. The
      total study period for each participant will be between 6 to 8 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential participants will be contacted via telephone, email and/or post by the study
      team. They will be screened for their eligibility, and if they are interested in
      participating, the first study visit (Visit 1) will be arranged where the written informed
      consent will be obtained then before any study related procedures.

      Visit 1 will be held as soon as possible following screening, aiming up to 16 weeks and 6
      days gestational age (early in pregnancy). Visit 2 will be aimed to coincide with the routine
      20 gestational week appointment or any time in second trimester from 17 weeks and 0 days
      gestational age to 27 weeks and 6 days gestational age (middle of pregnancy). Visit 3 will be
      aimed to coincide with the routine 28 gestational week appointment or any time in the third
      trimester from 28 weeks and 0 days gestational age onwards (late in pregnancy), Visit 4 will
      be aimed to coincide with the participant's routine admission on the labour ward or postnatal
      ward after giving birth, or anytime from the time of birth to 1 week postnatal age
      (postpartum period).

      At each study visit, the participants will be performing their own study samples of saliva,
      urine and vaginal secretions using the study specific self-sampling instructions provided.
      These self-samples will be tested for the presence and quantity of CMV DNA detected via a
      molecular technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If consent is obtained, a blood
      sample will also be collected at each study visit to test for cellular mediated immunity. At
      the last visit, the participant will be offered to have her newborn baby tested for
      congenital CMV by collecting the newborn's saliva sample which will be tested for CMV DNA via
      PCR.

      At each study visit, the participant will complete a short questionnaire on the participant's
      contact with their child(ren)'s saliva and urine (to identify risk factors for CMV shedding).
      At Visit 1, the participant will complete a background questionnaire (also to identify risk
      factors for CMV shedding)and at Visit 4 a feedback questionnaire (to assess feasibility).

      Where possible the study visits and blood samples will be aimed to take place alongside the
      participants' routine antenatal appointments and routine blood tests respectively.

      At the end of the study, up to 20 participants will be invited to take part in a process
      evaluation in the form of an interview by phone, skype or face to face to explore in depth
      the experiences of participation in the study.
