  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Citrate anticoagulation is becoming the gold standard in dialysis in intensive care units. It
      is now accepted that citrate prolongs the life of filters with a lower risk of bleeding.

      However, the management of citrate is complex. Optimization is based on citrate flow, blood
      flow and the amount of calcium reinjected. Frequently the citrate level is
      sub-dosed.Currently, the fraction of excretion of citrate by the hemodialysis machine is
      unknown. Knowing this information would allow, if it is important enough, to add an
      additional parameter of citrate management by adapting the level of dialysis.

      The determination of citrate in an extracorporeal circulation circuit has already been
      performed and has been validated in the literature. We propose to perform the assay on
      subjects with the same starting parameters, in order to deduce the clearance of citrate.

    <description>The APACHE II score is calculated at the beginning of the intensive care unit admission to help determine the patient's mortality risk for the admission. An integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death.</description>

    <description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA score), is used in intensive care units to determine and track the status of a patient with organ failure. The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems. Higher scores mean a higher risk of mortality.</description>
