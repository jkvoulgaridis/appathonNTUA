  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the spread of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC)
      during surgery in endometrial cancer. Although this cancer is often discovered at early
      stage, the risk of recurrence is estimated at 6 to 21%, according to grade. Early stage tumor
      is accessible for curative surgical treatment by laparoscopy but this kind of surgery may
      induce CTCs spread, and could be an explanation of this recurrence. Through this study,
      concordance between two blood punction sites, peripheral vein and ovarian vein, will be
      evaluated to detect these cells during surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single-center clinical trial is to determine the best blood punction site to
      observe the spreading of CTC during surgery in endometrial cancer. CTCs are very rare events
      on blood and their detection require extremely sensitive technologies. This pilot study will
      investigate CTC spread during surgery on 10 patients with endometrial cancer.

      The main objective is to compare venipuncture site for detection of CTCs in endometrial
      cancer during surgery. Blood samples are collected on a simple sampling (arm) compared to
      sampling as close as possible to the tumor (ovarian vein).
