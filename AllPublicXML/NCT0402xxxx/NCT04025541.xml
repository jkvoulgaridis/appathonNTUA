  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The circulating tumoral biomarkers in the blood are the object of numerous researches for
      several decades. The potential clinical interests of these circulating biomarkers are
      diagnostic, prognostic, predictive of the efficiency of targeted therapies (according to the
      mutational profile of the cancer), and could allow the study of the mechanisms of resistance
      under process. In the multiplicity of these blood potential biomarkers joins a permanent
      evolution of the technological means used to detect them/to quantify, as well as to estimate
      their clinical utility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new major challenge in the research concerns the circulating biomarkers, which aim at
      replacing the molecular analyses on tumour tissue obtained by biopsy (for example the search
      for somatic mutations of cancer) by a simple blood test (liquid biopsy). The other current
      important challenge is to have an idea of the interest to analyse the kinetics of blood
      markers, in particular in answer to a clinical &quot;event&quot;, either through the chemotherapy, a
      biopsy and / or surgery. There is almost no data in the literature on this aspect. It is very
      likely that the liberation in the blood of the blood tumoral markers is strongly dependent on
      medical interventions on the tumour.

      The study ALCINA 2 rests exactly on the principle of small cohorts, which correspond each to
      a clinical situation and/or a technique of different implemented detection, so as to generate
      data of feasibility and proof of concept. In case of success, statistical hypotheses will be
      necessary for the implementation of wider studies (being then the object of a specific
      approval by competent authorities).
