      To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this screening program in preventing pre-eclampsia.

      The incidence of pre-eclampsia is about 2-8%, it is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal
      mortality and morbidity. Both ACOG (American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) and
      NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guideline advocate the use of
      traditional screening method, which uses demographic characters and medical history to
      identify high risk women. This method detects only 35-40% of pre-eclampsia women. Study has
      shown that combination of maternal factors and biomarkers (uterine artery pulsatility index,
      placenta growth factor, PlGF; pregnancy associated plasma protein-A, PAPP-A) improves the
      detection rate.

      In Taiwan, the prevalence of pre-eclampsia is about 1.21%. The incidence of pre-eclampsia is
      correlated with maternal age, with a relative risk of 5.13-fold in women aged 40 and above.
      Marrying late predisposes these women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Our
      institution will be implementing first-trimester screening program starting from April 2019,
      this study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this screening program in
      preventing pre-eclampsia.
