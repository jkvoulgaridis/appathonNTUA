  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a self-monitoring intervention
      to improve shopping performance in adults with intellectual disability (ID) secondary to Down
      syndrome (DS). The research question asks, can an 8-week self-monitoring intervention,
      provided in a community-based setting, increase observable shopping skills in adults with ID
      secondary to DS?

    <textblock>
      Adults with intellectual disability secondary to Down syndrome often have difficulty
      performing complex activities of daily living, such as shopping. These difficulties may, in
      part, be influenced by deficits in metacognitive abilities, which include self-monitoring of
      one's performance. There is evidence that interventions which target self-monitoring skills
      can improve functional performance in adults and adolescents with traumatic brain injury.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on adults with Down syndrome have
      demonstrated impairments in metacognitive abilities, resulting from significant volume
      reduction in the frontal lobes and anterior cingulate cortex. These deficits likely
      contribute to the difficulties experienced by this population when performing instrumental
      activities of daily living (IADL), such as shopping. Although metacognitive-focused
      interventions that address self-monitoring skills have been used to improve functional
      performance in adults and adolescents with traumatic brain injury, these techniques have not
      yet been used to improve IADL performance in adults with intellectual disability secondary to
      Down syndrome.

      This 16-week study is a single-subject ABA design across ten participants to determine the
      effectiveness of a self-monitoring intervention on shopping performance in adults with
      intellectual disability secondary to Down syndrome. The intervention will span 8 weeks and
      will include weekly sessions that are delivered in an alternating group-individual format.
      Sessions will provide participants the opportunity to practice and apply self-monitoring
      techniques across a variety of shopping tasks and settings to promote generalization and
      transfer of learning. This study has the potential to provide preliminary information on the
      effectiveness of a self-monitoring intervention, provided in community-based settings, to
      increase observable shopping skills in adults with intellectual disability secondary to Down
      syndrome.

    <description>Shopping Skills Recording Sheet will be used to record the level of assistance (5-point ordinal scale) required by participants to demonstrate targeted shopping skills observed in the community. Completion of the instrument requires 25 minutes. There are five levels:
Independent (I) Client performs the task completely without cueing or assistance
Indirect cueing (IC) Therapist provides general information regarding performance, without explicitly stating what is to be done
Direct cueing (DC) Therapist provides specific instructions or feedback about performance
Partial assistance (PA) Client performs part, but not all of the task
Full assistance (FA) Therapist completes the task for the client in its entirety</description>

    <description>Intervention will occur once per week for a duration of 8 weeks. The intervention format will alternate between individual and group sessions, so that the first week of intervention will be provided in a group format, the second week will be provided in an individual format, and so forth. Sessions will be 90 minutes in duration. Data will be collected during individual sessions, which will occur every other week. During individual sessions, each participant will meet at the facility for the first 15 minutes, will travel to a local grocery store for 45 minutes, and then reconvene at the facility for the final 30 minutes. Group sessions will follow the same structure; however, all ten participants will be present. Each of the 8 sessions will consist of the following: awareness training; facilitation of strategy generation; facilitation of error detection; reinforcement of self-monitoring techniques; and opportunity for participants to practice self-monitoring techniques.</description>
