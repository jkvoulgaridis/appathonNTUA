      This study addresses whether the use of EnChroma products are feasible for use in the
      emergency department by color vision deficient providers.

      This study addresses whether it is feasible for color vision deficient (CVD) physicians and
      other healthcare providers to wear EnChroma products in the clinical setting. It is known
      that color vision is important to the practice of medicine. Identifying red skin or red ear
      drums, noticing whether lips have turned blue or a patient is pale, and identifying colors
      under a microscope all are aided by or dependent upon color vision. While color vision
      deficiency does not preclude a person from becoming and succeeding as a physician, it may be
      appropriate and desired to utilize devices to improve color vision during patient care.

    <description>Each participant will be provided EnChroma products to use indoors over the course of two weeks in the emergency department, educational settings, and in their personal life. They will be encouraged to wear the glasses for at least 10 hours over 1-2 weeks prior to wearing them in a clinical setting to adjust to their use, and for 10 minutes before beginning patient care as per manufacturer instructions. They will be encouraged to take specific note of clinical scenarios that require the use of color vision (e.g., - rashes, tympanic membrane erythema, stool guaiac testing, etc.).</description>
