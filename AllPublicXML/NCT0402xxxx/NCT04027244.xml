    <textblock>
      Single-centre prospective cohort study of patients presenting with severe limb ischaemia
      (SLI). The primary outcome measure will be 12 month major amputation rate. A historical
      cohort of patients identified retrospectively will be the comparitor group used to assess the
      impact of a newly-established rapid-access limb salvage clinic.

      Primary aim:

      - Determine the proportion of patients with SLI undergoing major lower limb amputation within
      12 months of presentation.

      Secondary aims:

        -  Assess clinically important short-, medium- and long-term outcomes in those undergoing
           and not undergoing amputation

        -  Prevalence and degree of frailty and cognitive impairment

        -  Pevalence and degree of cardiac disease (detected by stress MRI)

        -  Establish a biobank for future biomarker analysis

        -  Investigate the role of frailty and cognitive assessments, cardiac MRI and biomarkers in
           risk-stratification of patients with SLI

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe limb ischaemia (SLI) is the end-stage of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD)
      whereby the viability of the limb is threatened due to the degree of arterial disease and
      subsequent ischaemia in the peripheral tissues. It is defined as ischaemic rest pain (or
      night pain) and/or ulceration or gangrene in the affected limb(s) for a minimum of two weeks
      attributed to confirmed PAOD. Treatment includes open surgical and endovascular
      revascularisation, with or without surgical debridement of affected tissues, amputation of
      toes and drainage of sepsis. In some patients revascularisation is not possible or fails
      resulting in the person requiring a major lower limb amputation.

      Over 4000 major lower limb amputations per year were undertaken in England alone between 2003
      and 2013 and a diabetes-related major lower limb amputation is performed every 30 seconds
      world-wide. As many as 25% of people with SLI will undergo a major lower limb amputation in
      the first year after presentation. Amputation negatively affects quality of life due to its
      negative impact on mobility, independence and ability to carry out activities of daily
      living.

      This single-centre prospective cohort study will investigate the amputation rate at one year
      in patients presenting with SLI and compare this to a retrospectively identified historical
      cohort. This study will also investigate the prevelance and degree of frailty, cognitive
      impairment, and cardiac disease (detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), as
      well as establish a biobank for future biomarker analyses. The role of frailty and cognitive
      assessments, cardiac MRI and biomarker analysis in risk-stratifying patients with SLI will
      also be investigated.
