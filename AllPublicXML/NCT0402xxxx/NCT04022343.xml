  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well cabozantinib works in treating patients with
      kidney cancer before surgery. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (complete and partial responses), following the
      administration of cabozantinib for 12 weeks in patients with locally advanced biopsy-proven
      non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) prior to undergoing surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, and tolerability of neoadjuvant cabozantinib.

      II. To determine the clinical outcome (disease-free survival [DFS], overall survival [OS]) of
      patients with non-metastatic ccRCC who treated with neoadjuvant cabozantinib.

      III. To evaluate the surgery related outcomes.

      IV. To evaluate correlative studies, including biomarkers, quality of life, and
      frailty/sarcopenia assessment of patients with non-metastatic ccRCC who treated with
      neoadjuvant cabozantinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <time_frame>At 12 weeks after cabozantinib dose</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria. All tumor measurements must be recorded in centimeters.
For target lesions, a complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A partial response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter.</description>

    <measure>Disease-free survival (DFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of surgery to first tumor recurrence or death, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-free survival will be defined as the interval between time of surgery and the first tumor recurrence or death. Patients will be censored at time of last follow-up. Disease-free survival will be estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of surgery to death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>For overall survival, death from any cause will be defined as the event. Patients will be censored at time of last follow-up. Overall survival will be estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life assessment: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Specific Index-19 (FKSI-19) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 6 and 12 after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be studied using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Specific Index-19 (FKSI-19) questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 19 statements such as &quot;I have a lack of energy&quot; and &quot;I have pain&quot; which are answered on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being &quot;Not at all&quot; and 4 being &quot;Very much.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frailty assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 6 and 12 after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty assessment will be studied using the Fried Frailty score. Domains to be assessed include shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slow walking speed. Each domain yields a dichotomous score of 0 or 1. Totaled scores classify patients as not frail (0-1), intermediate frail (2-3), and frail (4-5).</description>
