  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigator would like to study the effect of yoga exercises and meditation on lung
      volume, respiratory impedance, 6-minute walk distance and quality of life in COPD patients.

      Hypotheses : The Investigator hypothesized that Yoga exercises improve the lung function
      (i.e. decrease in the lung hyperinflation, air trapping and airway impedance) by stretching
      the lung tissue, strengthening the respiratory muscles and increasing the chest expansion.
      Yoga exercises help to increase exercise capacity. Meditation reduces anxiety and depression.

      Research Question: Do yoga exercises and meditation help to reduce respiratory impedance,
      hyperinflation, air trapping and increase exercise capacity and improve quality of life in
      COPD patients compared to control arm?

      Objectives: 1. To study the effect of yoga exercises and meditation on exercise capacity and
      quality of life in COPD patients after 4, 8 and 12-weeks of intervention.

      2.To evaluate residual volume (RV), residual volume/ total lung volume RV/TLC, total lung
      capacity TLC,inspiratory capacity/total lung capacity IC/TLC, and respiratory impedance in
      COPD patients after 4, 8 and 12-weeks of yoga exercises and meditation practice.
