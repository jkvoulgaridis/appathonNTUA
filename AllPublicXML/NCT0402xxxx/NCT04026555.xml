    <textblock>
      The escalation of care for patients in a hospitalized setting between nurse practitioner
      managed services, teaching services, step-down units, and intensive care units is critical
      for appropriate care for any patient. Often such &quot;triggers&quot; for escalation are initiated
      based on the nursing evaluation of the patient, followed by physician history and physical
      exam, then augmented based on laboratory values. These &quot;triggers&quot; can enhance the care of
      patients without increasing the workload of responder teams. One of the goals in hospital
      medicine is the earlier identification of patients that require an escalation of care. The
      study team developed a model through a retrospective analysis of the historical data from the
      Mount Sinai Data Warehouse (MSDW), which can provide machine learning based triggers for
      escalation of care (Approved by: IRB-18-00581). This model is called &quot;Medical Early Warning
      Score ++&quot; (MEWS ++). This IRB seeks to prospectively validate the developed model through a
      pragmatic clinical trial of using these alerts to trigger an evaluation for appropriateness
      of escalation of care on two general inpatients wards, one medical and one surgical. These
      alerts will not change the standard of care. They will simply suggest to the care team that
      the patient should be further evaluated without specifying a subsequent specific course of
      action. In other words, these alerts in themselves does not designate any change to the care
      provider's clinical standard of care. The study team estimates that this study would require
      the evaluation of ~ 18380 bed movements and approximately 30 months to complete, based on the
      rate of escalation of care and rate of bed movements in the selected units.

      Objectives:

      Mount Sinai Hospital has developed a Rapid Response Team (RRT) system designed to give
      general floor care providers additional support for patients who may be requiring a higher
      level of care. This system enables both nurses and physicians to notify the RRT and have a
      critical care team evaluate the patients. During the period of 03/01/2018 to 09/17/2018,
      Mount Sinai Hospital floor units on 10W and 10E units made 357 rapid response team (RRT)
      calls with only 58 leading to an actual increase in the level of care (true positive rate ~
      16%). Similarly, the Electronic Health Record (EHR) generated 839 sepsis Best Practice Alerts
      (BPAs) yet only five led to escalations in care (true positive rate ~ 0.5%). The results
      above would imply that over 168 evaluations need to be made to identify a single case where
      the patient required an escalation in care. The goal of ReSCUE-ME is to evaluate prospective
      model performance and identify the best spot which the study team can incorporate MEWS++ into
      RRT and Primary providers workflow. The primary endpoint is rate of escalation of care on 10W
      and 10E during the study period.

      Background:

      In a prior study, the group has demonstrated that a machine learning model (MEWS++)
      significantly outperformed a standard, manually calculated MEWS score on a large
      retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients. To develop this model, the study team used a
      data set (Approved by: IRB-18-00581) of 96,645 patients with 157,984 hospital encounters and
      244,343 bed movements. The study team found that MEWS++ was superior to the standard MEWS
      model with a sensitivity of 81.6% vs. 44.6%, specificity of 75.5% vs. 64.5%, and area under
      the receiver operating curve of 0.85 vs. 0.71.

      Encouraged by this prior result, the study team is seeking to evaluate the model in a
      prospective study.

      A silent pilot of the ReSCUE-ME alerts has been running on 10E and 10W since Feb 2019. The
      study team has continuously monitoring the alert performance via a real-time web-based
      dashboard. The results are summarized below:

        -  Median # of alerts to primary team, per floor, per day: 8

        -  Median # of alerts to RRT, per floor, per day: 4

        -  Sensitivity 0.76, Specificity 0.68, AUC 0.77

        -  Accuracy 0.69, Precision 0.3, F1 Score 0.43 This performance compares very favorably to
           the performance seen in the retrospective historical cohort used to develop the MEWS++
           model:

        -  Sensitivity 0.82, Specificity 0.76, AUC 0.85

        -  Accuracy 0.76, Precision 0.12, F1 Score 0.19&quot;

    <intervention_model_description>For each patient, real-time data from clinical and administrative systems will be used by ReSCUE-ME to produce a MEWS++ score predicting the likelihood that the patient will require escalation of care within the next 6 hours. Upon the patient being admitted to the unit, the patient will be evaluated based on any update in the EMR. If the prediction score exceeds a &quot;high&quot; threshold, the RRT team will be notified directly. If the score is between a &quot;low&quot; threshold and the high threshold , the nursing team will be notified and increased nursing monitoring will be initiated. If the patient has met criteria for increased nursing monitoring, a refractory 8-hour refractory window will be applied during which no nursing alerts will be sent. However if the score exceeds the high threshold, the RRT team will be notified. Throughout the trial, the performance of the alerts will be monitored via web-based dashboards. If the performance is poor, the &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; thresholds will be adjusted.</intervention_model_description>
