  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) guided biliary drainage is indicated in case of impossibility or
      failure of classic biliary drainage by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography
      (ERCP). Recently the investigators reported a good efficiency of EUS guided
      choledocoduodenostomy using the HOT-AXIOS device (Electrocautery enhanced lumen apposing
      metal stent) in a retrospective multicentric study. Utilization of the recommended technique
      (direct punction with the HOT AXIOS using a pure cut current + using a 6 mm Stent) was the
      only predicting factor of clinical success. The investigators reevaluate this procedure one
      year after in the same centers.
