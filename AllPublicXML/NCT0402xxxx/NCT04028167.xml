      This study evaluates a novel regimen of induction chemotherapy using a combination of
      docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin, with short term infusional 5-FU (FLOT), given prior
      to chemoradiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel, as neoadjuvant therapy prior
      to definitive surgical resection for patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or
      gastroesophageal junction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical outcomes following standard of care therapy for resectable esophageal and
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma are suboptimal, with low rates of pathologic
      complete response (pCR) to current neoadjuvant treatment strategies. Although significant
      progress has been made by incorporation of neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative
      chemotherapy, most patients will ultimately develop disease recurrence, with both
      locoregional and distant recurrence representing a significant component of failure. For
      patients receiving preoperative chemoradiation, a regimen consisting of concurrent
      carboplatin and paclitaxel with radiotherapy has been established as a standard of care based
      on the Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer Followed by Surgery Study (CROSS). In the long
      term results of CROSS, locoregional progression was noted in 22% of patients receiving
      neoadjuvant therapy, with distant progression in 39%.

      Recent studies have also suggested perioperative chemotherapy as a potential alternative
      strategy for selected patients, based on results of the MAGIC trial, which included a subset
      patients with esophageal/GE junction tumor location, and demonstrated improved survival for
      patients receiving perioperative epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil (ECF)
      compared to surgery alone. The FLOT4-AIO trial has subsequently demonstrated a further
      overall survival benefit to a perioperative regimen of docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and
      leucovorin, with short term infusional 5-FU (FLOT) compared to ECF. A regimen of
      perioperative FLOT is currently being compared to preoperative chemoradiotherapy using the
      CROSS regimen in the ongoing ESOPEC trial (NCT02509286).

      Given the significant risk of recurrence either with the CROSS preoperative chemoradiation
      regimen, or the perioperative FLOT regimen, it is plausible that selected patients may
      benefit from a combination of intensified systemic therapy using the FLOT backbone, in
      combination with sequential preoperative chemoradiation due to the known risk of locoregional
      recurrence in this population. This study evaluates the proposed neoadjuvant regimen of
      induction FLOT followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with resectable cT3/T4 or
      node positive adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

          6. Subjects must be deemed a candidate for trimodality therapy (radiation, chemotherapy
             and surgery) based upon multidisciplinary evaluation with plan for preoperative
             chemoradiation followed by surgical resection.

          7. ECOG performance status score of 0-1 (See Appendix).

             for method(s) of contraception for the duration of the study period and at least 3
             months after the last dose of chemotherapy is administered. For the purpose of this
             study, a woman is considered of childbearing potential following menarche and until

             control methods and acceptable contraception. Such methods include:

               -  combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation:

               -  oral

               -  intravaginal

               -  transdermal

               -  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:

         12. WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive
             requirements but still must undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.

         13. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for methods
             of contraception for the duration of the study period and for at least 3 months

             addition, males must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time.

        Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements.

          8. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection, that in the opinion
             of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation, study
             treatment administration or would impair the ability of the subject to receive study
             treatment.

          9. Known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

         10. Clinically unstable cardiac disease including unstable angina, congestive heart

             carboplatin/paclitaxel) selected by the investigator. Investigators should refer to
