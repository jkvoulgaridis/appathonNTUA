    <measure>Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (PRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PRS measures the unpleasantness or affective dimension of a child's pain experience and is used in children aged 3-17 years old. The PRS consists of a set of cartoon faces with varying facial expressions ranging from a smile/laughter to tears, and each child is asked to select the facial expression that best represents his/her experience of discomfort. Each face has a numerical value ranging from 0 (smiling face, &quot;no hurt&quot;) to 5 (crying/screaming face, &quot;hurts worst&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Face, Legg, Cry, Consolability Scale (FLACC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The scale comprised the following parameters: (1) Face, (2) Legs, (3) Activity, (4) Cry, and (5) Consolability. Each of the five categories is scored from 0-2, which results in a minimum total score of 0 and maximumof 10. According to this scale: 0=Relaxed and comfortable (no pain); 1-3=Mild discomfort; 4-6=Moderate pain; and 7-10=Severe discomfort or pain [Willis et al., 2003]. Behavioural parameters were recorded.</description>
