  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, multi-arm study designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of idasanutlin, administered
      as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or venetoclax, in pediatric and young
      adult participants with acute leukemias or solid tumors.

      This study is divided into three parts: Part 1 will begin with dose escalation of idasanutlin
      as a single agent in pediatric participants with relapsed or refractory solid tumors to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) and to characterize
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Following MTD/MAD identification, three separate safety
      run-in cohorts in neuroblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) will be conducted to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      idasanutlin in each combination, with chemotherapy or venetoclax. Part 2 will evaluate the
      safety and early efficacy of idasanutlin in combination with chemotherapy or venetoclax in
      newly enrolled pediatric and young adult participants in neuroblastoma, AML,and ALL cohorts
      at idasanutlin RP2D. Part 3 will potentially be conducted as an additional expansion phase of
      the idasanutlin combination cohorts in neuroblastoma, AML, or ALL for further response and
      safety assessment.
