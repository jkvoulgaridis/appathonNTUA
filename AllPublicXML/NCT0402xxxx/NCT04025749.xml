  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a single-blind randomized controlled trial with sixty children
      with Cerebral Palsy (CP) to explore if a home-based computerized multi-modal executive
      training is effective improving infants' executive functions (EF), as the primary outcome. As
      secondary outcomes, it will be tested if the intervention exerts a positive effect on other
      cognitive functions, social relationships, and quality of life (QOL) in children with CP. It
      is expected to observe changes in brain structure and functioning associated to clinical
      improvements.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that a computerized multi-modal cognitive training
      will be more effective at improving EF than usual care alone.

      Secondary hypotheses are that the computerized therapy will be more effective than usual care
      alone at improving specific cognitive functions such as visuoperception, memory, social
      relationships and QOL. In addition, we also hypothesize there will be changes on brain
      structure and function. We further hypothesise that these changes will be maintained over
      time (9 months). Finally, sociodemographic and clinical factors are expected to be related
      with the level of efficacy of the computerized multi-modal cognitive training.
