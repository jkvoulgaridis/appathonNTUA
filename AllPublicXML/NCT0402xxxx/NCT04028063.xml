  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-institution, single arm Phase II study
      conducted using a Simon two-stage design with an additional safety lead-in. The overall
      objective is to determine the efficacy of combination doxorubicin with dual checkpoint
      blockade with anti-CTLA-4 antibody AGEN1884 and anti-PD-1 antibody AGEN2034. The
      investigators will estimate the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6mo) of
      doxorubicin plus AGEN1884/AGEN2034 in comparison to historical PFS6mo with doxorubicin
      monotherapy, calculated as the mean from two large randomized Phase 3 clinical trials.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint for the study is PFS6mo by RECIST 1.1. The sample size calculation is
      based on a Simon Two-Stage design with incorporation of early stopping rules for safety and
      futility (See section 9 for statistical considerations). The Investigators will enroll up to
      35 patients on the study to obtain 28 evaluable patients for the primary endpoint. Safety of
      the combination will be evaluated after the first six patients complete the DLT observation
      period of 9 weeks. This lengthy DLT period is designed to capture safety and toxicity
      profile, understanding that immune-related toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors may not
      emerge immediately. This will also ensure adequate evaluation of potential cardiac and
      hepatic toxicity from combination doxorubicin and checkpoint inhibitor therapy. If two or
      more patients experience DLT in the initial safety lead-in cohort, the regimen will be
      declared intolerable. Any patients who do not complete study therapy through the 9-week DLT
      observation period for any reasons other than toxicity will be replaced for safety lead-in
      assessment. If fewer than two patients experience DLT, the investigators will proceed to
      expansion to complete enrollment of 15 patients in Stage 1. Following enrollment of stage
      one, accrual will pause for analysis of efficacy. If 6 or fewer of the 15 patients are
      progression-free at 6 months, the investigators will halt the study for futility. If 7 or
      more patients are free from progression, then the investigators will proceed with enrollment
      of 13 additional patients to complete stage 2. the investigators are powered to detect
      improvement in 6-month PFS rate to 63.4% with the combination over the 43.4% historical
      PFS6mo.

             judgment of the interventional radiologist.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If

             will be required.

         12. Females of child bearing potential that are sexually active must agree to either
             practice 2 medically accepted highly effective methods of contraception at the same
             time or abstain from heterosexual intercourse from the time of signing the informed
             consent through 120 days after the last dose of study drug. See Appendix B for
             protocol-approved highly effective methods of contraceptive combinations. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

               -  Negative test for pregnancy is required of females of child-bearing potential. A

                  or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria:

                  naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses
                  at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months or 730 days.)

               -  Conception while on treatment must be avoided.

         13. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.
             Prior history of vasectomy does NOT replace requirement for contraceptive use.

         14. Subjects must either possess or undergo placement of central venous catheter,
             including pheresis or trifusion catheter, PICC line, or port.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy with anthracycline or checkpoint inhibitors.

          2. Hypersensitivity to doxorubicin or any excipients.

          3. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents (within 4 weeks prior
             to Cycle 1, Day 1).

          4. Prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or
             has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          5. Patient has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation
             therapy within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1
             or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia are an exception to this
             criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they
             must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the
             intervention prior to starting therapy.

          6. Additional known malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer.

          7. Patients with underlying immune deficiency, chronic infections including HIV,
             hepatitis, or tuberculosis (TB) or autoimmune disease.

             previous GI bleeding requiring intervention within the past 6 months. Newly diagnosed
             pulmonary emboli or deep venous thrombosis must be clinically stable on
             anticoagulation regimen for ≥ 4 weeks as of Cycle 1 Day 1.

          9. Has known history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required oral corticosteroid
             therapy for resolution within 12 months prior to study entry, or evidence by imaging
             or symptoms of active non-infectious pneumonitis.

         10. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis or leptomeningeal disease. Subjects with previously treated brain
             metastases may participate provided they are stable based on the following: 1) MRI
             brain obtained during screening evaluations shows no radiographic evidence of
             progression or new lesions, 2) any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline, 3)
             no requirement for steroids for at least 28 days prior to trial treatment. This
             exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of
             clinical stability. Patients without a known history of brain metastases do not
             require screening brain MRI prior to study enrollment.

             study requirements/treatment, including NYHA Class II or greater heart disease (see
             Appendix C for definitions).

         17. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         18. Had a previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to another monoclonal antibody.
