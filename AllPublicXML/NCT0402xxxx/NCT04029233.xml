  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous transcatheter closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) to reduce the risk of
      recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke due to a presumed
      paradoxical embolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate stroke recurrence rates after interventional PFO closure with
      an Occlutech PFO Occluder in patients who have experienced at least one ischemic cryptogenic
      stroke attributed to patent foramen ovale (PFO) who have high risk PFO, i.e. large PFO (≥2
      mm), or PFO of any size and atrial septal aneurysm (ASA).

        This study will enroll patients of either sex, aged ≥18 and ≤60 years, with at least one
        event of cryptogenic ischemic stroke in the last 6 months. Patients must have a high risk
        PFO indicated for device-assisted closure; either large PFO (≥2 mm), or PFO of any size and
        ASA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years and ≤60 years

          -  At least one event of cryptogenic ischemic stroke in the last 6 months

          -  Presence of a PFO indicated for device-assisted closure (in compliance with the
             Instruction for Use) confirmed by common practice procedures

          -  A large PFO (maximum separation of the septum primum from the secundum) of ≥2 mm
             confirmed by common practice procedures, or an ASA defined by common practice
             procedures as septum primum excursion of ≥10 mm

          -  Life expectancy of at least 1 year

          -  Ability to speak fluently and to understand the language in which the study is being
             conducted

          -  Written, informed consent by the patient for participation in the study and agreement
             to comply with the follow-up schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute infection(s)

          -  Known coagulation disorder

             post intervention

          -  Intolerance to contrast agents, if not medically manageable

          -  Participation in another clinical investigation &lt;30 days before intended Occlutech PFO
             Occluder implantation procedure (note that in line with Medical Device Reporting,
             registries are not considered as clinical investigations)

          -  Contraindication to use of trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) and/or use of
             general anesthetic

          -  Atrial thrombus

          -  Patients whose size or condition would cause them to be a poor candidate for cardiac
             catheterization (e.g. too small for echocardiography imaging probe, catheter size,
             vasculature size, active infection, body weight &lt;8 kg)

        The following exclusion criteria are at the discretion of the investigator:

             the conduct of the study
