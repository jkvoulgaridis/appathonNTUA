      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of an arm cycle ergometer
      training in subjects with proximal femur fracture surgically treated. The secondary purpose
      of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to verify whether the addition of aerobic
      activity can increase motor performance compared to a conventional exercise program in which
      no aerobic activity is foreseen.

      Every year in Italy more than 100,000 persons aged &gt; 65 incur in a hip fracture [Piscitelli
      et al. 2010; Tarantino et al. 2018]. The direct costs sustained by National Health System
      both for hospitalization and rehabilitation following hip fracture in elderly people were
      estimated in more than one billion euro [Tarantino et al. 2018; Rossini et al. 2005]. Despite
      incidence rate is decreasing in the last years, the number of hospitalizations for hip
      fractures is still increasing due to the population aging [Tarantino et al. 2018]. Some
      estimates assume that the number of fractures per year will double by 2050 [Tarantino et al.
      2018; Brown et al. 2012]. Observational studies suggest that following hip fracture, only
      40-60% of people who survive are likely to reach their prefracture level of mobility [Shah et
      al. 2001; Magaziner et al. 2000; Norton et al. 2000]. Up to 70% may recover their level of
      independence for basic activities of daily living [Shah et al. 2001; Norton et al. 2000;
      Beaupre et al. 2007] and less than half of all people experiencing hip fracture may regain
      their ability to perform instrumental ADLs [Vergara et al. 2014].

      In Italy, as in Western nations, approximately 10-20% of patients are institutionalized after
      a hip fracture [Piscitelli et al. 2012], which imposes a large cost burden on society
      [Marottoli et al. 1994].Then, it is widely recognised that a vicious cycle can occur after a
      hip fracture where pain and hospitalization result in disuse atrophy of muscles and general
      low level of aerobic fitness which increases the risk of immobility and new fractures [French
      et al. 2008]. The aerobic fitness level of older adults is a primary determinant of health
      and morbidity and thus serves as a powerful predictor of quality of life and independent
      living [Taylor et al. 2004]. Moreover, a number of guidelines [Geneva: WHO, 2010; ACSM's
      Exercise for Older Adults, 2011] recommend that older people, aged over 65, perform at least
      150 minutes per week of medium-intensity aerobic activity (where aerobic activity refers to
      different activities, such as example: walking, cycling, etc.). Elderly subjects undergoing
      rehabilitation should be physically active to the extent granted by disability and health
      status [Geneva: WHO, 2010].

      Contrary to this, patients post-surgery of femur fracture perform low levels of physical
      activity. In fact patients spend at least 98% of the day during the rehabilitation period in
      a sitting or lying down position in the bed [Davenport et al. 2015]. On average, these
      patients take 36 steps a day, which results in less than the 2,000-9,000 steps needed to stay
      healthy [Tudor-Locke et al. 2009]. Indeed deconditioning can be consider a major determining
      factor for the unsatisfactory recovery of motor skills for patients undergoing femoral
      surgery during rehabilitation [Davenport et al. 2015].

      There is irrefutable evidence showing the beneficial effects of exercise in both prevention
      and treatment of several diseases. A lot of studies have shown that both men and women who
      report increased levels of physical activity and fitness have reductions in relative risk of
      death (by about 20%-35%) [Macera et al. 2003]. The benefits of exercise are evident, not only
      in healthy persons but also in patients.

      Unfortunately, it is hardly conceivable that these patients could reach, in a hospitalization
      regime, activity levels equal to those recommended by the guidelines. For all these reasons,
      we have introduced aerobic training performed with an arm cycle ergometer, in patients
      hospitalized and subjected to conventional rehabilitation.

      The primary purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to verify the feasibility
      of an aerobic exercise program in subjects with recent proximal femur fracture treated
      surgically.

      The secondary purpose is to verify whether the addition of aerobic activity can increase
      motor performance compared to a program in which no aerobic activity is foreseen. In
      particular, we expect the patients belonging to the intervention group to walk faster than
      those who have performed only conventional physiotherapy treatment.

    <measure>Analysis of feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the feasibility, it will be evaluated:
The eligibility rate (the total number of patients admitted with femur fractures and screening divided by the total number of patients meeting the criteria).
The recruitment rate (the number of patients recruited among those eligible).
The subjects' compliance level will be analyzed dichotomously (no compliance &lt;10 sessions, yes compliance ≥ 10 sessions).
Rate of patients who lost the evaluation at the end of the treatment and at the follow-up after 100 days.
Any negative effects will be recorded and counted. The following types of adverse events will be calculated separately: a) adverse reactions, adverse events, serious adverse events and suspected serious adverse events.
Adherence to treatment: the number of sessions in which patients have reached goal 1) of 30 minutes and 2) intensity between 50%-85% HRmax.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG) test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TUG is a physical functional measure in which subjects are asked to stand up from a chair, walk 3 m to a horizontal line marked with tape on the floor, turn around, walk back and sit down at a comfortable pace (Podsiadlo et al., 1991).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10-meter Walking Test (10mWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the 10mWT the time taken by the patient to travel a linear distance of 10 meters will be timed. During the execution of the test the number of supports will also be recorded, so as to secondly calculate the walking speed (speed (m / s) = space (m) / time (s)), the step length (step length (cm) = 1000 / number of steps) and cadence (cadence (steps / min) = number of steps / time (s) * 60) (Hollman et al., 2008).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulated Ambulation Score - Italian version (CAS-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAS-I is a 3-item scale assessing activities that characterize the patient's basic mobility skills: 1) getting in and out of bed, 2) sit-to-stand from a chair with armrests and 3) walking indoors with the use of appropriate walking aids. Each activity is assessed on a three-point ordinal scale from 0-2 (0 = Not able to, despite human assistance and verbal cueing, 1 = Able to, with human assistance and/or verbal cueing from one or more persons, 2 = Able to safely, without human assistance or verbal cueing, use of a walking aid allowed) resulting in a total daily CAS score ranging from zero to six. The CAS scale showed to be a potentially valuable score for early prediction of short-term postoperative outcome after hip fracture surgery.</description>

    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale - 5 levels (ABC 5-levels)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale led to assessing the confidence of self-reported balance during daily life activities. Each of the 16 items is assigned a score between 0 (no security) and 4 (total security).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum isometric force of the knee extensors</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum isometric force of the knee extensors will be evaluated pre- and post-training with the use of a manual dynamometer (Roy and Doherty, 2004). The patient will be required to perform a sub-maximal contraction in knee extension, followed by four maximal contractions during which the patient is verbally encouraged by the therapist. The evaluation will be performed first on the healthy limb, then on the operated limb, with a 30-second pause between one contraction and the next. The best value of the 4 tests will then be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Ranking Scale (VRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain related to femoral fracture will be assessed using the Verbal Ranking Scale (VRS). Divided over 5 levels (VRS 0-4: 0 = no pain; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong; 4 = extreme), it allows to record the maximum pain experienced by the patient in the previous 48 hours in the execution of some functional activities, such as sitting, keeping standing and walking (Leino et al., 2011).</description>
