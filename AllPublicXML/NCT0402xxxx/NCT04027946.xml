  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Over 230,000 new lung cancer cases are diagnosed every year in the U.S. About 80% of lung
      cancers are NSCLC. Most people have a more advanced stage of the disease that doesn t respond
      well to standard treatment. Researchers want to see if a combination of drugs may be able to
      help.

      Objective:

      To find out if LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab can help tumors to shrink in people with
      NSCLC.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with NSCLC that has not responded to standard therapies

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Tumor sample. If one is not available, they will have a biopsy.

        -  Assessments of ability to perform normal activities

        -  Lung function tests

        -  Blood, heart, and urine tests

        -  CT and PET scans: They will like in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

      Participants will take LMB-100 in 21-day cycles for up to 2 cycles. They will take the drug
      by injection into an arm vein on days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle. They will stay in the
      hospital 7-10 days each cycle. Then they will get pembrolizumab by injection into an arm vein
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. They may be able to take pembrolizumab an additional year if
      their cancer gets worse.

      Participants will have repeats of the screening tests throughout the study.

      About 30 days and 90 days after they stop treatment, participants will have follow-up visits.
      Then they will have visits every 6-12 weeks. They will be followed for the rest of their life
      through phone calls and emails.

      Background:

        -  Mesothelin is expressed in approximately half of all lung adenocarcinomas.

        -  LMB-100 has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy against several mesothelin expressing tumor
           models including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).- Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1)
           is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 that has been shown to negatively
           regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands.

        -  Pembrolizumab, an IgG4 monoclonal antagonist antibody to PD-1, is FDA approved in the
           frontline for advanced non-squamous NSCLC as a single agent with high PD-L1 expression
           [tumor proportion score (TPS) &gt;=50%] or in combination with platinum-based doublet
           chemotherapy (PD-L1 unselected). It also approved in the second-line for high PDL1
           expressing tumors (TPS &gt;=1%).

        -  Combination treatment with LMB-100 plus pembrolizumab results in greater anti-tumor
           efficacy in murine lung cancer model.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the objective response rate of LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab in the
      treatment of subjects with mesothelin-expressing non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell
           lung cancer lacking an EGFR sensitizing mutation, ALK or ROS1 gene rearrangement and not
           amenable to potentially curative surgical resection or chemoradiation.

        -  Tumor mesothelin expression of at least 25% of tumor cells as determined by the
           Laboratory of Pathology at the NCI.

        -  Subjects must have at least progressed after one prior platinum-based doublet
           chemotherapy AND standard immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) with either frontline
           single-agent pembrolizumab, or in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy,
           or second-line single-agent nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab.

        -  Age &gt;= 18 years.

      Design:

        -  This is an open-label, single center phase II study of LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab
           in subjects with mesothelin expressing NSCLC who have progressed on standard therapies

        -  Subjects will receive LMB-100 at the single agent MTD (140mg/kg) on days 1, 3 and 5 of a
           21-day cycle for up to 2 cycles and pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 of cycle 3 of a 21-
           day cycle (or cycle 2 if disease progression is observed after 1 cycle) onwards until
           disease progression (on or after pembrolizumab) or intolerable toxicity for a maximum of
           2 years (unless second course initiated).

        -  The total accrual ceiling for the screening will be set at 100 total patients in order
           to treat 23 subjects.

                  allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist(R)) are live
                  attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

               -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid
                  therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other
                  form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to start of study therapy.

               -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
                  years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.., thyroxine, insulin, or
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

               -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD)
                  that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ILD

               -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
                  abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the
                  subject s participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best
                  interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating
                  investigator.

               -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
                  cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

               -  A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of
                  study therapy. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative,
                  a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: In the event that 72 hours have
                  elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study
                  treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be
                  negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.

               -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within
                  the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through
                  180 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from
                  this study because LMB-100 + pembrolizumab are agents with the potential for
                  teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
                  risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother
                  with LMB-100 + pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
                  is treated with LMB-100 + pembrolizumab. These potential risks may also apply to
                  other agents used in this study.

               -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV positive patients
                  will be excluded due to a theoretical concern that the degree of immune
                  suppression associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV
                  infection. (Note: No HIV testing is required)

               -  Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen
                  [HBsAg] reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA
                  [qualitative] is detected) infection. or active HBV or HCV infection. (Note: No
                  testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required.)

               -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active
                  treatment within the past 2 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma
                  of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g.
                  breast carcinoma, cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially
                  curative therapy are not excluded.

               -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

               -  Participants with contra-indication and/or history of severe hypersensitivity
                  reactions to any components related to LMB-100 or pembrolizumab (or any other
                  immune checkpoint inhibitor such as PD1, PDL-1 and CTLA4).

               -  Active or uncontrolled infections.

               -  Subjects who experienced severe or life-threatening immune-related AEs with prior
