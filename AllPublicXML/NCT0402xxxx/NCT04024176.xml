  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of moderate hemophilia is less codified than those of severe patients; because
      these patients are theoretically less likely to bleed and therefore less likely to develop
      arthropathies. Nowaways, the question arises as to the appropriateness of this &quot;symptomatic&quot;
      management for the prevention of the occurrence of hemophilic arthropathies. Indeed, a
      significant number of moderate hemophiliacs seems to develop severe arthropathies that cause
      significant disability. However, because of the very small proportion of these patients in
      the total number of hemophiliacs, data are lacking on the impact of arthropathies on this
      population. The investigators therefore propose to include moderate hemophiliac patients in
      the study to carry out an evaluation of gait, using a gait analysis to determine the
      consequences of arthropathies, even sub-clinical ones, according to the duration of the
      disease's progression. In an associated way, the analysis of different clinical (joint
      assessment; quality of life score;...), radiological (radiographic; ultrasound (synovial
      thickness)), biological (level of associated factors ; other associated marker), in order to
      provide a complete picture of the articular situation in these patients with moderate
      haemophilia.
