  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) have
      greater risk of developing dementia. Cognitive intervention is a topic of great interest in
      individuals with MCI and SCD for the purpose of preventing or delaying the occurrence of
      dementia. There are many different types of cognitive interventions, which aim to positively
      impact the cognitive functioning of an individual and have been classified as cognitive
      stimulation, cognitive training, and cognitive rehabilitation. However, most studies used
      neuropsychological cognitive measures for outcome evaluation. The impact of cognitive
      interventions on daily functional performance among individuals with MCI and SCD were rarely
      explored. In addition, cognitive training focusing on specific cognitive outcomes is
      suspected to have limited far transfer to everyday measures. Therefore, a multicomponent
      intervention which integrates several types of intervention is recommended to reach the
      maximum impact on daily function.

      The purposes of this study are to examine the effects of a multicomponent cognitive
      intervention on cognitive and daily functional outcomes in individuals with MCI and SCD, and
      to compare the effects between the two groups. In addition, the investigators will also
      investigate whether the demographic (e.g., age and educational level, etc.) and clinical
      variables (e.g., duration of cognitive complains, level of depression and baseline cognitive
      function, etc.) may affect the outcomes of cognitive intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pretest-posttest design. Thirty-five subjects with MCI and 35 with SCD, who
      are diagnosed by physicians, will be recruited from the neurology outpatient clinic of NTU
      hospital. All participants will wait for 16 weeks as a historical control and then receive
      the multicomponent cognitive intervention. The intervention is composed of 14 weekly 1.5-hour
      group sessions and 2 individual sessions in a 4-month period.

      The multicomponent cognitive intervention in this study is a combination of several
      approaches, including cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, lifestyle interventions,
      and psychological interventions. Cognitive training is an approach which trains patients by
      repeated practicing to optimize or restore cognitive functions. Cognitive rehabilitation is
      tailored programs in which therapist usually provides patient strategies focusing on specific
      activities of daily life. Lifestyle interventions educate and encourage individuals to make
      changes to their life to balance the risk and protective factors. The strategies can include
      regular physical exercise, healthy nutrition (i.e., Mediterranean diet), frequent
      participation in cognitively-stimulating activities, and reduction of smoking and heavy
      alcohol consumption. Psychological interventions target neuropsychiatric symptoms that are
      common among individuals with SCD and MCI (e.g., depression, anxiety, fatigue, poor sleep)
      and thus include relaxation exercises, mindfulness techniques, skills to manage stress and
      poor sleep, and cognitive behavioral techniques. By using the approaches above together, the
      investigators hope to improve participants' cognitive and daily function.

      All participants will be assessed at four time points: before waiting period (A0), before the
      intervention (A1), right after the 16-week intervention (A2), and 16 weeks after the
      intervention (A3). The primary outcomes are the subjective and objective performance of
      activities of daily living, and the secondary outcomes are the cognitive performance on the
      neurological tests, anxiety, and depression.

    <description>The intervention takes place in groups of 6-10 participants and is leaded by one occupational therapist. It includes 16 sessions, 90 minutes each.
The first part of each session starts with a 15-minute review of previous homework or relaxation. The second part, which lasts 35 minutes, involves structured training with activity-sheets, board games, role-playing and computerized games. The third part, which lasts 30 minutes, is the lifestyle interventions. The instructor explains the generalization of the previous activities toward daily life, and introduces healthy lifestyles. Through group discussions, the therapist guides participants to develop solutions and strategies for their memory or cognition-related problems and application to daily life. The last 10 minutes are used to suggest homework.</description>
