      To assess the impact of the socio-economic level on the effectiveness of a comprehensive
      multidisciplinary program of transitional care for crhonic heart failure patients (primary
      objective); to analyze this specifically in the various chronic management profiles of CHF
      patients and to study the associations between socio-economic level and other psychosocial
      aspects (secondary objective).

      The SELENE Study (Impact of SocioEconomic Limitations on health outcomes in patients with
      complex and advanced chronic cardiovascular conditions in high-standard iNtegrated care
      Environments) is an observational, cohort, prospective, multicenter study of consecutive
      patients treated in a comprehensive heart failure (HF) management program, and hospitalized
      by decompensated HF in our healthcare area; aimed at evaluating the impact of socioeconomic
      level on the effectiveness of a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of transitional care
      to patients with HF, both globally and in the various profiles of chronic management of HF.

      In this study we aim to assess the impact of the socio-economic level on the effectiveness of
      a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of transitional care for chronic heart failure
      patients (primary objective); to analyze this specifically in the various chronic management
      profiles of HF patients and to study the associations between NSE and other psychosocial
      aspects (secondary objective).

      All patients will have a detailed assessment by a social worker of a battery of psychosocial
      and functional variables, including educational level, functional status, cognitive status,
      family support, or the existence of a primary caregiver and an assessment of purchasing power
      through the value of monthly income. The events that will be analyzed, both for the primary
      objective of the study and the secondary objective related to the different follow-up
      profiles, will be re-admissions at 30 days (primary event), and mortality at 30, 90 and 180
      days, as well as hospital admission at 90 days and 6 months (secondary events). Using the
      &quot;median&quot; income group as a reference, comparisons will be made between the rates of these
      events among the different groups.

      The researchers hypothesize that the socioeconomic level has an impact on clinical events of
      HF patients so that the effectiveness of comprehensive care programs for HF is attenuated in
      patients with low socioeconomic level.

    <description>Occurrence of cardiovascular death or non-fatal heart failure events (time to first event) during a follow-up period of 6 months. Non-fatal heart failure event is defined as a new episode of worsening of symptoms and signs consistent with acute decompensated HF requiring intravenous decongestive therapy (e.g. diuretics) either on an outpatient basis (day-case HF hospital) or in the emergency department (&lt;24 hours) or requiring unplanned hospital admission (&gt;24 hours) or complicating the course of a non-cardiovascular admission.</description>

    <description>The study does not imply any specific therapeutic intervention, and will not imply any change in the management of the participating patients, who will follow the usual clinical controls and will receive the medical and invasive treatments usually provided to patients with HF in our health area; as well as the different modalities of specific health education for this disease. At the time of hospital discharge, patients will be handled according to the usual protocols of the center established for outpatient follow-up of HF patients.</description>

    <description>Standard follow-up involves hospital and primary care for HF patients. In this context, physicians and nurses experienced in the care and management of HF direct care. HF care is based on 1) active detection of newly admitted HF patients, 2) planned educational interventions to improve self-care, 3) completion of a comprehensive psychosocial assessment of patients and caregivers, 4) discharge planning and home transition coordination involving the hospital HF team and Primary Care teams, 5) structured and planned evidence-based follow-up shortly after discharge from hospital.</description>
