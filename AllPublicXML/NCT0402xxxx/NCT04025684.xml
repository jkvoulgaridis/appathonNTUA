  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical methodology development study will evaluate the plaque removal efficacy of four
      marketed manual toothbrushes, with differing bristle types and brush head designs, in healthy
      dentate participants. Changes in supra-gingival plaque accumulation will be assessed after
      first use and following 1-and 4-weeks treatment (twice-daily brushing), using two different
      clinical measures of dental plaque. Study participants will abstain from oral hygiene for a
      period of 12-18 hours prior to each assessment visit. Data generated will inform the design
      of future clinical studies investigating the plaque removal efficacy of manual toothbrushes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, 4-week, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, four-treatment
      arm, parallel design, clinical methodology development study to investigate the plaque
      removal efficacy of marketed manual toothbrushes in healthy, dentate participants. Changes in
      plaque level will be evaluated after first brushing, after two further single brushing events
      (Days 7 and 28) and following 7 and 28 days usage (twice daily brushing with assigned
      toothbrush treatment).

      Supra-gingival plaque levels will be assessed using two established clinical measures: the
      Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) and the 6-site Turesky Modified Quigley and Hein
      Plaque Index (TPI). Participants will abstain from oral hygiene for a period of 12-18 hours
      prior to each assessment visit. Participants with Day 0 pre-brushing mean RPI overall ≥ 0.6
      will be stratified by their Day 0 pre-brushing RPI score (lower: mean RPI overall ≥ 0.6 to ≤
      0.8; higher: mean RPI overall; 0.8 to 1.0) and randomized to study treatment (Visit 2).

      To standardize oral hygiene practice, eligible participants will complete a lead-in period
      (minimum 5 days) prior to Visit 2 during which they will brush with the toothbrush and
      regular fluoride toothpaste provided.

      The safety and oral tolerability of each study toothbrush will be monitored after first use
      and over the 28-day usage period by review of reported treatment emergent adverse events
      (TEAEs).

    <description>Supra-gingival plaque will be assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth (7-7 each arch) using the RPI index. Third molars can be included in the assessment if they are functioning as second molars and gradable. Each tooth surface is divided into nine zones: A-C along the gingival margin; D-F (inter-proximal zones) directly above A-C; G-H across the middle of the tooth and I covers the incisal area. Plaque will be disclosed on a scale (0-1), where 0 represents no dental plaque and 1 represents dental plaque. Mean RPI overall will be calculated for each participant as the total score for all tooth sites assessed divided by the total number of tooth sites assessed. Change from baseline will be derived for each individual tooth site first before calculating the mean overall change for all sites assessed. Lower values (i.e. 0) represents lower plaque.</description>

    <description>Supra-gingival plaque will be assessed on the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth (7-7 in each arch) using TPI. Third molars can be included in the assessment if are functioning as second molars and gradable. Each tooth surface is divided into 3 areas: 3 facially (mesiofacial, facial, distofacial) and 3 lingually (mesiolingual, lingual, distolingual) for a total of 6 scores per tooth. The TPI is a 6-point scale (score range 0-5) generally, higher scores indicate greater plaque coverage:0=no plaque;1=slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of tooth; 2=thin continuous band of plaque (1 mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth; 3=band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of crown of tooth; 4=plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of crown of tooth; 5=plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth.Mean TPI overall will be calculated as mean RPI overall.</description>
