      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week early intervention
      program that will include 12 weekly hours in an intensive center-based preschool environment
      to treat social communication deficits in children with developmental disorders. The study
      will include children with developmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder,
      neurogenetic disorders, or intellectual disability.
