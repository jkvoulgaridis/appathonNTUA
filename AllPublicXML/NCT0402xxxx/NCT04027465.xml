  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether tolerance to eggs can be induced in patients through a process
      of oral immunotherapy. Participants will be randomized into groups receiving oral
      immunotherapy and a control group that will receive no intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing to initiate a study assessing a common desensitization
      protocol for egg allergy. This study would enable the investigators to better determine the
      potential benefit of desensitization in individuals with egg allergy.

      More specifically, the investigators will address the following research objectives:

      Objectives A. To develop a protocols for egg desensitization

      B. To determine the rate of desensitization to egg.

      C. To characterize predictors of successful desensitization.

      D. To characterize molecular mechanisms involved in the process of desensitization

      These objectives will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial

    <description>Following randomization, participants in this group will receive escalating doses of egg protein, up to a dose of 300 mg. Once they attain that dose, they will maintain it for six months. At the end of this maintenance period, they will undergo a singe-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge</description>

    <description>Subjects in the treatment will begin treatment by undergoing an egg oral challenge. This will confirm that the subject is still allergic to egg and establish the dose of egg the subject can tolerate. The last dose of egg tolerated during the challenge will serve as the first desensitization dose Subjects will then come to the research center every two weeks to receive their dose increases until they reach the maintenance dose of 300 mg. Subjects will then enter the maintenance phase for one year. During this period they will undergo another oral food challenge one month after attaining the maintenance dose</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children 6 years and older

          -  Informed consent form signed by the parents or legal guardian (appendix B).

          -  A history suggestive of immediate allergy to egg. A convincing clinical history of an
             IgE mediated reaction to a specific food will be defined as a minimum of 2 mild
             signs/symptoms or 1 moderate or 1 severe sign/symptom that was likely IgE mediated and
             occurred within 120 minutes after ingestion or contact (or inhalation in the case of
             fish and shellfish). Reactions will be considered mild if they involve pruritus,
             urticaria, flushing, or rhinoconjunctivitis; moderate if they involve angioedema,
             throat tightness, gastrointestinal complaints, or breathing difficulties (other than
             wheeze); and severe if they involve wheeze, cyanosis, or circulatory collapse

          -  Positive oral challenge test to egg. Oral challenges will be performed with Meringue
             Powder according to the recommendations of the position paper of the European Academy
             of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (68)and in an open manner (appendix C). When
             subjective symptoms will appear (oral pruritus, abdominal discomfort), the challenge
             tests will be blinded.

          -  The presence of at least one of the following confirmatory tests:

             i) Positive SPT to egg or its proteins (weal diameter 3 mm larger than that of the
             normal saline control). The allergens used will be commercial extracts of egg (Omega
             Labs, Toronto, Ontario). OR ii) Detection of serum specific IgE (&gt;0.35 kU/L) to egg or
             any of its proteins (ovalbumin, ovomucoid, lysozyme and conalbumin), measured by
             fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (Phadia, CAP System, Uppsala, Sweden).

        Exclusion criteria.

          -  Patients who are unstable from a respiratory point of view ..

          -  Patients who present with intercurrent disease at the time of starting
             desensitization.

          -  Non-IgE-mediated or non-immunological adverse reactions to nuts.

          -  Malignant or immunopathological diseases and/or severe primary or secondary immune
             deficiencies.

          -  Patients receiving immunosuppressor therapy

          -  Patients receiving Î²-blockers (including topical formulations).

          -  Associated diseases contraindicating the use of epinephrine: cardiovascular disease or
             severe hypertension.

          -  Patients diagnosed with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder .
