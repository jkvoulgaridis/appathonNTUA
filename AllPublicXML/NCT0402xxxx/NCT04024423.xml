  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sources of NTM infection and modes of transmission among CF patients are poorly understood.
      Healthcare-associated transmission of NTM among CF patients has been suspected and is of
      growing concern for CF Centers. There is a need for a systematic evidence-based approach to
      investigating potential episodes of healthcare-associated transmission. Clusters of highly
      similar strains of NTM in CF patients cared for at the same CF Center may arise from
      healthcare sources including patient-to-patient transmission and/or acquisition from water
      sources within a healthcare setting. The primary objective of the study is to facilitate a
      standardized process by which CF Centers may perform data abstraction on patients identified
      with highly similar NTM isolates and determine if clustered NTM strains are related to
      strains isolated from healthcare setting water biofilm sources. HALT NTM is available to the
      entire CF Foundation Care Network, under a collaborative agreement, to initiate a
      standardized, independent, confidential, internal NTM outbreak investigation. Patients that
      are identified by whole genome sequencing as having highly similar NTM strains and receiving
      care in the same CF Care Center are eligible. The study's primary endpoint is to identify
      potential modes and sources of healthcare-associated acquisition of CF NTM, thereby revealing
      risk factors for NTM acquisition.
