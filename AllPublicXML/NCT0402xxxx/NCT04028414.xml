  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to compare outcomes following early versus delayed
      weight bearing for adult patients operatively treated for an ankle fracture without
      syndesmotic fixation. Additionally, early weight bearing will be tested in patients with
      unicondylar plateau fractures that do not involve joint impaction in the context of a pilot
      study.

      The purpose of this multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare outcomes
      following early versus delayed weight bearing among individuals with a traumatic ankle
      fracture. This study will enroll patients ages 18 to 65 surgically treated for an ankle
      fracture or fracture dislocation (without syndesmosis) at participating civilian trauma
      centers and military treatment facilities. Eligible patients will be identified during
      hospitalization for definitive treatment and enrolled prior to discharge or at the first post
      op clinic visit. Patients that consent to participate will complete a baseline assessment at
      the first post op clinic visit and will be randomized to early versus delayed weight bearing.
      Both treatment groups will receive standardized exercises that can be done at home or with a
      therapist. Outcomes will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months following definitive
      fracture fixation. All 6 week, 3 and 6 month evaluations will take place in the surgeon's
      outpatient clinic and involve clinical and radiographic assessments of healing as well as
      functional outcome surveys. The 12 month evaluation will be conducted by phone except for
      individuals who were judged not to be healed (clinically or radiographically) at 6 months;
      these participants will be asked to return for their 12 month evaluation (to assess healing).
      Simultaneously, a pilot RCT will be conducted in patients 18-65 surgically treated with a
      unicondylar plateau fracture without joint impaction. The figure below provides an overview
      of the study timeline and procedures.

    <description>Participants will be asked what they were doing most of the time during the previous two weeks (working/active duty, laid off/looking for work, going to school, taking care of a home, etc.). If participants are working, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire will be administered.The WPAI measures work time missed and work and activity impairment because of a specified health problem during the past 7 days (http://www.reillyassociates.net/WPAI_SHP.html).</description>

    <measure>Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain intensity domain at 3, 6 and 12 months. 27 The BPI pain intensity domain is compatible with the IMMPACT guidelines for assessing pain in clinical trials and the FDA Guidance for Industry on the use of Patient-Reported Outcome.</description>

    <measure>Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will also be measured using the PROMIS Pain interference subscale. In addition, at each follow-up, the treating surgeon will also record the type and frequency of pain medications (grouped as acetaminophen, opioids, GABA analogues, NSAIDs and other).</description>

    <description>Patients with ankle fractures will be instructed to weight bear as tolerated (WBAT) while in a boot with a heel to toe normal gait and wean from walker or crutches to a cane or no support device. At the 6 week post op visit, patients with ankle fractures will be instructed to wean from the boot and continue full weight bearing as tolerated until full weight bearing is achieved. Patients with plateau fractures will be instructed to begin WBAT until full weight bearing is achieved.</description>

Patients will be instructed to keep foot off of floor or set ball of foot or heal on ground for balance using walker or crutches at all times. After the 6 week post op visit, patients may begin weight bearing as tolerated. Patients with tibial plateau fractures will be instructed to touch down (toe touch or foot flat) weight bear (approximately 10% of body weight) for at least 6 weeks.

    <ipd_description>Data sharing beyond manuscripts and scientific presentations will be processed through the METRC website in the short term. Currently, a standard form will be available for researchers outside METRC to request access to final data generated from METRC studies. These requests will be transmitted to the METRC Coordinating Center for initial review to make sure the relevant materials are provided in support of the request. METRC is committed to making data as widely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of study participants and protecting the intellectual property of the Consortium.
Data will only be made available after it is completely stripped of identifiable information such as dates, geographic locators, and any other event information which is sufficiently rare as to make it possible to deduce the identity of an individual participant.
