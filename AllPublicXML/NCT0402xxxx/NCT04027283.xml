  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of intragastric (ig) D-allulose on
      metabolic parameters in general and to investigate the effect of sweet taste receptor
      blockade on GI hormone responses, glycemic control, gastric emptying (GE) rates and
      appetite-related sensations to ig administration of erythritol and D-allulose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erythritol (natural non-caloric sweetener) could be an ideal candidate substitute for sugar
      as it may reduce caloric intake without compensatory overeating or earlier return of hunger.
      Moreover, it may serve as a physiological tool to disentangle the effects of gastrointestinal
      (GI) sweet taste receptor stimulation, (an)orexigenic hormone secretion, and glucose
      metabolism/caloric content on food intake regulation in vivo in humans. However, its effects
      on appetite, satiation, and satiety have not been studied systematically. Moreover, the
      mechanisms underlying erythritol-induced anorexigenic GI hormone release have not been
      investigated so far.

      D-allulose is a sugar substitute with almost zero calories and is naturally occurring in
      small quantities. Apart from its use as sugar replacement, D-allulose seems to favorably
      affect glycemic control and metabolism as could be shown in animal trials and in a few human
      trials. However, to date the effects of D-allulose on GI hormone secretion, appetite-related
      sensations and glycemic control, are not or insufficiently studied in humans.

      The aim of this project is therefore to investigate the effect of intragastric (ig)
      D-allulose on metabolic parameters in general and to investigate the effect of sweet taste
      receptor blockade on GI hormone responses, glycemic control, gastric emptying (GE) rates and
      appetite-related sensations to ig administration of erythritol and D-allulose.
