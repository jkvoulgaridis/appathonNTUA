  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anaesthesia is the anaesthetic technique of choice for elective caesarean delivery.
      Hypotension, a result of the decrease in systemic vascular resistance caused by spinal
      anaesthesia, is a frequent complication occurring in up to 80%. This study is to investigate
      fluid loading plus vasopressors to vasopressors alone to maintain stable maternal
      haemodynamics in elective caesarean delivery. The effect of the two methods (continuous
      prophylactic phenylephrine infusion with and without crystalloid co-loading) on maternal
      haemodynamics will be compared using the Starling SV Monitor. The Starling SV device is a non
      invasive cardiac output monitor (NICOM) which is certified and validated for the use in
      pregnancy.

    <description>The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).</description>
