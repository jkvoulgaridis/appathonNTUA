  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the limited efficacy of the Spring
      Distraction System (SDS) and Bilateral One Way Rod (NEMOST) in maintaining curve reduction
      without repeat lengthening procedures and complications. Secondary aims are to investigate
      growth of the instrumented spine and to compare these devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several innovative solutions have been developed to treat growing children with a severe
      scoliosis. One device (SDS) was developed internally at the department of orthopaedics UMC
      Utrecht in the Netherlands. The other device (NEMOST) was developed at the Necker Hospital in
      France.

      This study is designed as a multicenter, limited-efficacy study using two prospective cohorts
      according a randomised clinical trial. The study will be done in two centers (UMC Utrecht and
      Amsterdam UMC).

      The primary endpoints are the limited-efficacy in terms of maintenance of curve correction
      and occurrence of SAEs related to the procedure. These data will be compared to a recently
      described cohort of patients that received a &quot;standard treatment&quot;, the MGCR (Skov et al.,
      2017). Secondary endpoints include patient performance based on the EOSQ 24 and Lenke
      questionnaire, surgical parameters, maintenance of curve mobility by using ultrasound and
      pulmonary function
