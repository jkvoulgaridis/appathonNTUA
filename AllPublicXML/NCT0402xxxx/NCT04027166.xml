  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male and female participants, over the age of 18, with OUD currently receiving methadone will
      be enrolled. This within-subject study design will assess pain and cognitive performance in
      individuals with OUD engaged in MMT. Participants will be asked to complete two separate
      4-hour sessions that will be spaced approximately 2-15 days apart. The two sessions will
      differ based on methadone administration to evaluate study variables in methadone peak
      (immediately after dose) and trough (20-24 hour after last dose) states. The order of these
      sessions will be counterbalanced across participants. At the beginning of each session,
      participants will complete a pain sensitivity task at baseline and post-methadone
      administration to determine pain threshold and tolerance. Participants will then complete
      computerized cognitive assessments of working memory, set-shifting, attentional bias, and
      behavioral inhibition. The cognitive assessments will administered across three time-points
      (0, 90, and 180 minutes). Pain threshold and tolerance will be measured again after 240
      minutes. In addition, opioid craving, withdrawal, pain intensity, and emotional valence will
      be repeatedly assessed during 240 minute session.

      After completion of the phone screen, eligible participants will be brought into the
      laboratory, given a description of the study, and assessed on inclusion and exclusion
      criteria by research personnel. Details pertaining to the cognitive measures, pain measures,
      and methadone manipulation will be discussed and informed consent will be obtained along with
      a signed release to allow study personnel to monitor opioid maintenance. Information on
      medical, psychiatric and drug use histories will be collected. Individuals with a history of
      vascular problems or high blood pressure will be evaluated by the research physician. In
      addition, laboratory tests collecting information on blood alcohol content and urine
      toxicology will be conducted. Participants will be deemed ineligible to participate if they
      are not medically cleared by research clinician. Veterans who have a positive BAC will be
      rescheduled and the methadone maintenance program's clinical protocol will be implemented.

      All sessions will be conducted at the West Haven VA Connecticut Healthcare Campus.
      Participants will be asked to complete two sessions, approximately 2-15 days apart. Order of
      peak and trough sessions will be counterbalanced between participants. Each session will last
      approximately four hours. Prior to each testing session, participants will be asked to
      refrain from caffeine for at least one hour. They will be served a standardized breakfast
      (i.e., bagel and cream cheese) and offered one smoke break prior to beginning the
      experimental session. They will be asked to refrain from smoking until the completion of the
      study protocol. Methadone administration will be coordinated with methadone maintenance
      treatment staff to relay information about which condition the participant will complete on a
      given session. At the start of each session, participants will complete computerized
      cognitive assessments and self-report questionnaires. The computerized cognitive measures
      will repeated at hours 0, 1.5, and 3. Several state questionnaires will be administered at
      hours every 30 minutes. Participants will also complete a pain sensitivity measure (i.e.,
      cold pressor task) to assess baseline threshold and tolerance at hour 0 and hour 4.
