  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a term used to describe a complex clinical condition that includes
      abdominal obesity, increased level of serum triglycerides, elevated blood pressure, decreased
      level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high fasting glucose level. Metabolic
      syndrome represents one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular
      diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to the results of numerous previously
      conducted studies, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the individuals with
      schizophrenia is higher than in the general population.

      The reasons for the higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the individuals with
      schizophrenia are not yet fully clarified. Nevertheless, unhealthy dietary habits are
      considered to be one of the main factors that could have an impact on metabolic syndrome
      development. According to the results of published studies, individuals with schizophrenia
      have poorer dietary habits when compared to people without mental disorders.

      Although there are numerous previously published studies focused on the impact of nutritional
      interventions on metabolic syndrome in individuals with schizophrenia, there is still no
      consensus on what would be the most appropriate nutrition therapy for the treatment of
      metabolic syndrome in this specific population group. Furthermore, the vast majority of the
      published studies have been conducted on outpatients, with only a small number of them being
      carried out on hospitalized individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is primarily intended to those
      individuals with elevated blood pressure, but according to some authors, it could have
      beneficial effects in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome as well. DASH diet represents a
      healthy way of eating with a special emphasis on low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables
      and whole grains, together with an overall reduction in sodium intake.

      Therefore, the present study aims to determine the impact of dietary habits and nutrition
      intervention on metabolic syndrome parameters in hospitalized individuals with the diagnosis
      of schizophrenia.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will result in the improvement in
      metabolic syndrome parameters, the amelioration in dietary habits, and the reduction in body
      weight.
