  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to analyse the effect of phosphate supplementation on donors undergoing
      partial hepatectomy for LDLT. In Group A, we are going to supplement phosphate in donors
      postoperatively from day 1 to day 5. We will analyse the trend of serum phosphate levels in
      donors postoperatively, its correlation with occurrence of postoperative complications and
      status of liver regeneration by CT volumetry on Day 7. Group B will constitute the controls
      for the study and hence attempt to find out the effect of phosphate supplementation in all
      donors postoperatively. We will analyse the data and elucidate the value of phosphate
      supplementation in reducing the occurrence of complications and effect on liver regeneration
      in donors in LDLT.
