  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women's awareness about the danger of certain medicines taken during pregnancy presents a
      real public health issue. To enhance awareness and information for women and healthcare
      professionals, new pictograms &quot; pregnant women &quot; appeared on medication boxes, on October 16,
      2017. These new pictograms can change women's perception of self-medication during pregnancy
      and of the danger of taking certain medicines for the unborn development. Furthermore, the
      investigators can wonder if the meaning of these pictograms is well understood. Therefore,
      the study's primary aim is to assess the knowledge of pregnant or childbearing age women
      about the pictograms associated with the danger of certain medicines taken during pregnancy.
