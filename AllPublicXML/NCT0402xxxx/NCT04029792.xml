  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to study the effect of the combination of plant extracts (BSL_EP028)
      on joint mobility, physical performance and vitality in a group of healthy older adults who
      remit some joint discomfort. This is a preliminary study whose purpose is to gather
      information for future studies.

    <textblock>
      The natural aging process involves several body changes that can affect to the mobility of
      subjects. Among them, those that affect the joints may have the greatest impact on mobility.
      With age, there is a progressive loss of the cartilage that covers the joints, as well as the
      synovial fluid, which in turn increases the stiffness of the ligaments and tendons that allow
      joint mobility, which implies a reduction in muscle tone and bone strength. This joint
      degeneration produces pain and discomfort, which leads to stiffness and restriction of
      movement. Therefore, and as a consequence of this loss of mobility, subjects decrease their
      physical performance, which can affect their mood and vitality. All of these may lead to a
      loss of quality of life and to an increase of the risk of future adverse health events, such
      as disability, institutionalization, hospitalization and the need for home medical care.

      For all these reasons, and considering the increase in the ageing population worldwide, it
      seems relevant to develop new strategies to improve joint mobility, physical performance and
      vitality that are safe for the consumer, affordable and not associated with undesirable side
      effects. In this regard, natural plant extracts have been widely used as a traditional remedy
      to reduce joint pain, reduce fatigue and improve mood and physical performance.
