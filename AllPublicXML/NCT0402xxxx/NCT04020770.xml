  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vibration therapy is a possible alternative to drug-based treatments for spasticity following
      SCI. Research indicates that it may provide temporary relief from spasticity, but many
      interventions under investigation are not portable and therefore access is limited. The aim
      of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a portable vibrating device to
      decrease UE spasticity.
