  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether consuming foods from animals raised
      with antimicrobial medications influences gut health in adults between the ages of 21-69
      years old. Antimicrobial medications are commonly used to help animals avoid infections while
      growing.

      The researchers plan to investigate differences in the resistome (i.e., populations of
      antimicrobial resistance genes) and microbiome (populations of bacteria) in feces obtained
      from people when they consume diets containing beef derived from cattle raised conventionally
      (i.e. using antimicrobial drugs(AMDs)) vs. those produced in raised without antibiotics (RWA)
      systems. In addition, the researchers will investigate whether specific antimicrobial
      resistant (AMR) genes are transmitted from food to people.

      The hypothesis is that beef is not a significant source of resistant bacteria, and there is
      no difference in the likelihood of gut colonization with resistant bacteria in people eating
      beef derived from cattle raised conventionally (i.e. using AMDs) vs. those eating beef
      produced in RWA systems.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 16-week randomized, cross-over, controlled, blinded study. During weeks 2 and 9, participants usual, unrestricted dietary intakes will be assessed. At week 3 the participants will be randomized and assigned to consume either the controlled U.S. Healthy Eating Pattern with beef produced in conventional systems or to an identical controlled U.S. Healthy Eating Patter with beef produced in RWA (raised without antibiotics) systems. Week 10 will be the second 3- week long dietary intervention period. A total of 14 stool samples will be collected during the study (two after baseline, washout 1 and washout 2, and 4 during the two dietary interventions). Two fasting state serum samples and a psychological questionnaire will be collected during study weeks 2, 5, 9, and 12.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The resistome and microbiome of rinsates will be obtained from dietary components, and feces collected from the particpants. Researchers will sequence all of the published AMR genes. Microbiome data will be obtained from 16s rRNA gene sequencing to produce amplicons of the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes. Statistical analyses will be conducted of microbial features to assess whether microbial/resistome communities diverge between the two groups. Additionally, foodborne transmission of AMR genes with discriminatory SNP(&quot;DNA fingerprints&quot;) profiles will be investigated through the food chain into dietary trial participants to identify highly discriminatory patterns in individual genes, or discriminatory profiles in gene sets.

    <measure>Questionnaire score of mood and health and well being</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS (Profile of Mood States) Questionnaire is a psychological rating scale to assess distinct mood states. There is a total of 35 questions using a five point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot; indicating the range of mood swings over a period of time.
The Optum SF-36v2 (Short Form 36 question Version 2) Health Survey measures the functional health and wellbeing of a participant. SF-36v2 consists of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is transformed into a 0-100 scales, with the assumption that each questions carries equal weight (the lower the score the more disability, the higher the score the less disability).
The hypothesis is that there is no difference in mood and health and wellbeing in people eating beef derived from cattle raised conventionally vs. those eating beef produced in RWA systems.</description>
