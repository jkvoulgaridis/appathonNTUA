  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety planning is a brief, ED-feasible intervention which has been demonstrated to save
      lives and has been universally recommended by every recent expert consensus panel on suicide
      prevention strategies. In one popular version of the safety plan developed by Stanley et al,
      the patient is encouraged to write out the following items: identifying personal signs of a
      crisis; helpful internal coping strategies; social contacts or settings which may distract
      from a crisis; using family members or friends for help when in crisis; mental health
      professionals who can be contacted when in crisis; and restricting access to lethal means.

      This study aims to find out how valuable an electronic safety plan is compared to a
      traditional paper safety plan. People who are visiting the emergency department for thoughts
      of self-harm will be asked to participate.

      This project has 3 aims: (1) Will ED patients with suicidal ideation/attempt accept coaching
      on safety planning from non-clinical personnel (i.e., medical students or peer supporters);
      (2) Are these safety plans of high-enough quality for clinical personnel; and finally, (3)
      Will ED patients with suicidal ideation/attempt complete safety plans electronically?

    <measure>Quality of safety plans</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the quality of the completed safety plans. This will be done by retrospective review after the patient has left the ED. The assessment of quality will use the same measures as Gamarra et al, namely an assessment of how many items are filled out and to what degree the answers reflect personalization. The number of safety plans that must be repeated or redone by the ED mental health clinician will also be tracked.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with safety planning</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate patient satisfaction with safety planning. This will be assessed by having the patient rate their experience with the safety planning process on a 6-point Likert scale (strongly disagree; disagree; moderately disagree; moderately agree; agree; strongly agree). A Likert scale measures how much someone disagrees or agrees with a particular statement.</description>

    <description>The My3 app is an electronic version of a safety plan, and is available for download at: http://my3app.org/. This app is owned by Link2HealthSolutions, Inc, which is the administrator for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. It was created in partnership with the California Mental Health Services Act. Unlike the paper version, the My3 app allows participants to email a copy of their safety plan to whomever they wish. It also allows patients to dial 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline from the app.</description>
