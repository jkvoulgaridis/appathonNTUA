  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to teach emergency medicine resident physicians to communicate more
      effectively with patients at the time of emergency department discharge in the setting of
      diagnostic uncertainty (i.e. no definitive cause identified for the patient's symptoms). All
      residents will complete baseline and follow up assessments by completing in-person simulated
      patient discharged. After the baseline assessment, they will complete an online educational
      curriculum that has been developed by the study team, and will participate in video-based
      simulation deliberate practice (DP) and feedback sessions using a simulation-based mastery
      learning (SBML) approach. They will be assessed with the Uncertainty Communication Checklist
      (UCC), a tool already developed by the study team, that has a minimum passing standard (MPS)
      that was established through engagement of both patients and physicians. The investigators
      will perform a 2-arm wait-list randomized control trial with resident physicians to test the
      efficacy of the SBML curriculum in training residents to have a discharge discussion with
      patients discharged from the emergency department with diagnostic uncertainty.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will employ a 2-arm wait-list control trial. Participants will be evenly randomly assigned to Group A or Group B. Investigators will use a control arm (Group B) to compare the impact of exposure to the educational curriculum to the impact of the baseline testing (T1) alone on subsequent test scores. However, to maintain the goal of mastery learning curriculum of allowing all learners to achieve mastery, following the second test (T2), the Group B participants will also be exposed to the intervention. All participants will return for a third test (T3). For participants in Group A, T3 will provide information about the decay of learned skills and if performance on the task is maintained by a single intervention or would require further follow-up education.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will have at least three study visits. The first visit (T1) will consist of a baseline test, during which participants will complete a simulated encounter with a standardized patient (SP) to establish a baseline score. Participants in Group A will be given access to the online interactive module and will have the opportunity to have video-based DP sessions with the SPs. The second visit (T2) will be scheduled 4-8 weeks after T1 and will consist of another simulated encounter with the SP. Group A will return for a third visit (T3) to provide information about the decay of learned skills and if performance on the task is maintained by a single intervention.</description>

    <description>The intervention includes: 1) Online web-based education module created with the Rise 360 platform that has ten lessons, providing the learner with an introduction, background, and a map of how to navigate a discharge conversation for patients with diagnostic uncertainty. Core content are presented with multiple interactive components such as flip-cards, multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, sketch videos, and narrated clips. 2) Mobile application game designed to facilitate practice of the content learned in the online curriculum 3) Deliberate practice sessions allow trainees to practice communication techniques presented within the online module and to receive feedback on their performance. These sessions will be conducted with standardized patients via a video platform, during a scheduled appointment.</description>
