    <textblock>
      An proof-of-concept study to determine whether administration of testosterone enanthate
      weekly results in greater improvements in structural and functional characteristics of pelvic
      floor muscles and urodynamic parameters in postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence
      than that associated with placebo administration

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgen therapy has been widely promoted in women with low serum testosterone levels for the
      treatment of sexual dysfunction and also for potentially improving body composition, muscle
      performance, bone mineral density and cognition. Androgens are known to exert direct anabolic
      effects on skeletal muscle. Testosterone supplementation results in dose-dependent increases
      in both muscle mass and strength in men. Similarly, our group has also demonstrated that
      24-weeks of testosterone administration in hysterectomized women with low testosterone levels
      was associated with dose and concentration-dependent gains in lean body mass, chest-press
      power and loaded stair-climb power. Given that androgen receptors have been shown to be
      expressed throughout the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract, the anabolic effects of
      androgens on pelvic floor muscles and urethral sphincter may provide a therapeutic option in
      women with urinary incontinence.

      In spite of the recognition of the important role of androgens in regulation of pelvic floor
      muscle mass and function, no randomized trials of the effects of testosterone or selective
      androgen receptor modulators have been published. Towards our long-term goal of conducting
      such a randomized efficacy trial of the effect of androgens in women with urinary
      incontinence, this initial pilot study will provide important data as a proof-of-the concept
      that the mass and function of levator ani and other pelvic floor muscles can be increased
      meaningfully by administration of testosterone, and that the increase in the mass and
      function of pelvic floor muscles will be associated with significant improvements in
      urodynamic parameters. Although MRI has been used clinically to evaluate pelvic floor
      anatomy, dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor muscles coupled with urodynamic studies has not been
      standardized previously; an important aim of this pilot study is to optimize the procedures
      for dynamic MR imaging of the pelvic floor structures and couple them with evaluation of
      urodynamics of the urinary bladder, bladder sphincter, and the urethra. Furthermore, the
      preliminary estimates of effect size and variance generated in this pilot study will guide
      the estimates of sample size and statistical power in subsequent larger randomized efficacy
      trials of androgens in women with urinary incontinence.

    <description>Urinary Incontinence will be assessed by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6 Short Form). The UDI-6 Short Form is a questionnaire with 6 questions that assess the presence and severity of urinary incontinence symptoms. Each question has a potential score of 1 to 4. The final UDI-6 score is calculated by adding all scores as explained above, and dividing the result by 6 to obtain a mean value which is in turn multiplied by 25 to obtain the scale score.
The total scaled score can range from 0 to 100, higher scores indicating more severe urinary incontinence, and lower scores indicating less severe urinary incontinence</description>

         25. Current enrollment in clinical drug intervention studies in the preceding 90 days

         26. Hematocrit &lt; 30% or &gt;48% (Since hematocrit values can transiently increase as a result
             of dehydration, and the subjects in this trial are required to come after an overnight
             fast, hematocrit levels may be repeated once if the investigators determine that the
