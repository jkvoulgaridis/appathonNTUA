  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with chronic insomnia have persistent difficulty falling and staying asleep, as
      well as complaints of altered daytime functioning that may be associated with cognitive
      impairments. The neural processes underlying these daytime complaints may involve abnormal
      activation of brain regions and neural networks involved in working memory, memory encoding
      and emotions. The goal of this study is to assess whether a psychological treatment for
      insomnia will reverse these abnormalities in brain responses to cognitive tasks and at rest.
      A secondary objective of the study is to characterize impairments in attentional processing
      and assess if the impairments can be reversed by the psychological treatment. We hypothesized
      that the psychological treatment for insomnia will lead to a normalization of the brain
      responses to working memory, declarative memory encoding, insomnia-related stimuli, and the
      functional connectivity within the default-mode and limbic networks.

      Study hypothesis

      Brain responses associated with working memory task and declarative memory encoding will be
      decreased in chronic insomnia compared to good sleepers and, among individuals with chronic
      insomnia, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia will lead to larger recovery in these
      brain responses, compared to a 3-month wait period.

      Brain responses to emotional stimulation, especially to insomnia-related stimuli, will be
      increased in chronic insomnia compared to good sleepers, and, among individuals with chronic
      insomnia, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia will lead to larger reduction in these
      brain responses, compared to a 3-month wait period.

      Connectivity in the default-mode and limbic networks during resting-state will be increased
      in chronic insomnia compared to good sleepers, and, among individuals with chronic insomnia,
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia will lead to larger reduction in this connectivity,
      compared to a 3-month wait period.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized controlled trial. Participants with chronic insomnia are randomized to either immediate cognitive-behavioural therapy or a 3-month wait-list period using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Randomization is conducted with block sizes of 4 participants. Randomization results are contained in sealed opaque envelopes that are opened in the presence of the participants after the completion of the pre-treatment assessment. A second assessment will be conducted after the treatment or waiting period. A follow-up assessment is conducted 12 months after the completion of the post-treatment assessment. A group of good sleepers, matched on age and gender with the insomniacs, will also be recruited and assessed at baseline only to provide a normative reference group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants with chronic primary insomnia are randomized into 2 groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio, after the completion of the pre-treatment assessment. Post-treatment and post-waitlist assessment occur after the 3-month treatment or waiting period.
One group will receive the intervention immediately after the pre-treatment assessment and the other group will receive the intervention after a waiting period of 3 months. The intervention consists of manualized cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia. This treatment includes psychoeducation about sleep and circadian rhythms, stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation, and cognitive therapy. The therapy is administered individually. Participants meet for 8 sessions of 50 minutes spread over 12 weeks.</description>
