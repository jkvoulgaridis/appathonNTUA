  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to understand if single-session interventions are
      acceptable, culturally appropriate, and effective for Indian adolescents attending a rural,
      low-resource government school. The investigators will be examining the effects of a
      computerized intervention on the well-being and mental health of adolescents. The
      investigators hypothesize that the intervention will yield statistically significant
      improvements in wellbeing and mental health relative to a study skills control condition.

  <why_stopped>
    In collaboration with community partners, we determined that the reading level required for the
    intervention did not make it suitable for the adolescents.
