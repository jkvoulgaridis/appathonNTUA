  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common smoking-related lung disease.
      Patients with COPD are at increased risk of readmission to hospitals within the following 30
      days. Hospital readmissions of COPD contribute to clinical and economic burden on society.
      Understanding why some COPD patients are readmitted remains a key area of unmet need.

      To our knowledge, no previous study has fully investigated both the social and clinical risk
      factors associated with these types of patients. The investigators want to prospectively and
      comprehensively explore the possible causes, whether clinical or social factors, that cause
      rehospitalisation. The investigators will be collecting demographic and clinical information
      including daily physical activity level, lung function, blood and sputum samples. These
      measurements will be collected at patient admission, discharge and at follow-up of 30 and 90
      days. This process could lead to a better understanding of the reasons which prevent early
      hospital readmission for those patients.
