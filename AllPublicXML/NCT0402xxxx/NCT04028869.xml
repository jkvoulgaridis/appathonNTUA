    <textblock>
      This study was a retrospective clinical observation cohort study. All patients with
      autoimmune liver disease treated with glycyrrhizic acid preparations in the Department of
      Liver Diseases, Department of Liver Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical
      University, were enrolled. Clinical follow-up data including demographics, hematuria, and
      liver and kidney were collected. Functional, electrolyte blood glucose, PTA, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, serum AFP and other clinical biochemical indicators and autoantibodies,
      special proteins and liver imaging (liver ultrasound) examination. The clinical effect of
      glycyrrhizic acid preparation for the treatment of autoimmune liver disease for 144 weeks and
      the safety during treatment were analyzed.
