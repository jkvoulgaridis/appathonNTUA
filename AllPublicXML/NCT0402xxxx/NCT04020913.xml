  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to measure the functional effects of recombinant GH in skeletal
      muscle, in addition to growth promotion, in short prepubertal boys with either growth hormone
      deficiency or idiopathic short stature. Patients will be similarly short. The investigators
      will also compare these values in the short stature cohort to those obtained in testing
      performed in normally growing age-matched healthy control boys not on GH. The group on GH
      will be studied before and after 6 and 12 months of GH treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prepubertal boys with significant short stature (height SDS ≤-2.0) diagnosed with either GH
      deficiency or idiopathic short stature (ISS) who are identified as candidates for GH
      treatment will recruited. Subjects will have a battery of studies to assess skeletal muscle
      strength, agility, power and endurance, as well as assessment of body composition and energy
      expenditure before and after GH administration. GH (Somatropin) treatment at standard doses
      will be given as daily injections at bedtime. Subjects will be followed at three-month
      intervals per the clinical routine, when anthropometric measurements will be obtained.
      Baseline studies will be repeated at 6 and 12 months from initiation of treatment, each
      patient will serve as his own control pre and post GH.

      A group of normally statured healthy boys will have the same testing as the study patients
      but without GH treatment to assess the impact of natural growth on the muscle measures above.
