      Brief Summary: The aim of this study is to analyze in elderly patients with undifferentiated
      dyspnea, the concordance of diagnosis before and after a focus thoracic ultrasound in
      comparison with the reference one established by an adjudication committee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is associated with a variety of etiology whose diagnosis is challenging especially in
      elderly patients with unconventional symptoms. Focus thoracic ultrasound is composed by an
      advanced cardiac ultrasound with Doppler measures and a lung ultrasound. It has already
      demonstrated its ability to reduce diagnosis uncertainty in emergency patients with dyspnea.
      However, adequacy of diagnosis before and after thoracic ultrasound has not been investigated
      in such patients.

      In this population, after clinical examination and use of any resource deemed necessary, the
      physician states its hypothesis in closed list. An emergency physician then realizes a
      thoracic ultrasound exam. An adjudication committee with all the patient's file will state
      the reference hypothesis.
