    <textblock>
      This interventional trial recruits women with endometrial cancer to participate in high
      intensity interval training (HIIT) prior to their standard of care surgery. The study will
      evaluate tissue and blood to determine if HIIT training has anti-cancer effects. Participants
      will be randomized into two arms: HIIT training and no HIIT training

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Determine the anti-proliferative effect of HIIT on the endometrium of women with
           endometrial cancer

        2. Compare the change in proliferation between initial biopsy and biopsy at surgery in EC
           patients in the HIIT intervention to the same samples in the standard of care control
           group.

      Participants randomized to HIIT training will undergo baseline testing, be taught how to
      perform personalized HIIT training prior to surgery, and repeat testing after surgery.
      Participants on the no HIIT training arm will undergo baseline testing and repeat testing
      after surgery. Tissue specimens will be collected from standard of care biopsy (no extra
      biopsy needed) and during surgery. Blood will be collected twice during standard of care
      blood draws.
