    <textblock>
      Internet-based applications are potential supporters for individuals in weight loss programs
      due to their accessibility and wide access. These applications are aimed at changing the
      lifestyle of individuals.

      This study is a randomized controlled study aiming to evaluate the effect of phone
      application supported nutrition education on weight loss according to standard education. It
      has been assumed that the telephone application would increase the adaptation and motivation
      of the people on diet. Anthropometric measurements and nutritional features of individuals,
      Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL test), Quality of Life SF-36, Rosenberg Self-Esteem, Obese
      Individuals Specific Quality of Life, Healthy Life Style Behaviour Scale-II and Healthy
      Eating Index score changes questioned as intermediate variables. Between March and September
      2018, 79 people aged between 18-64 years, whose BMI was 25 and more, who were admitted to the
      dietitian at Ege University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases
      Clinic and received routine nutrition education were included in the study. In the first
      interview, the data collection form of all individuals was filled out and anthropometric
      measurements of all individuals were made by the researcher. All individuals received a
      classic nutrition education by the clinical dietician and then written personal weight loss
      diets. Afterwards, only a control appointment for 3 months later was given to the control
      group. Phone application named Motive designed by the researcher uploaded to only case
      group's phone. With the telephone application text, visual and video notifications were sent
      to case group for 3 months.
