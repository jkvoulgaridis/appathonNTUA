  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a novel, neuro-protective and
      neuro-restorative dietary supplement (Braini®) on standardized memory and cognitive
      performance parameters. The principal active ingredients in the Braini® supplement have been
      commercially-available since at least 2015 or have achieved FDA new dietary ingredient
      notification (NDIN) in 2018, with no adverse events reported to the FDA.

      A 28-day randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled dietary supplement study will be
      conducted to achieve the purpose of this study. The research team hypothesizes that Braini®
      will improve standardized performance scores on up to 7 different standard memory and
      cognitive performance assays more effectively than placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of people affected by cognitive decline continues to rise as the US population
      ages. A recent report indicates that this decline can be seen as early as age 45. Optimizing
      cognitive function during adulthood is a key mechanism to combat cognitive decline as one
      reaches older adulthood.

      Recent advances in cognitive wellness management have shown that tailored diet and lifestyle
      regimens that factor in various biomarkers and proclivities signaling cognitive decline (e.g.
      family genetics) can cause a person with a declining MOCA (measure of cognitive ability)
      score to restore or achieve an improved MOCA score.

      A number of clinical trials have studied nutraceutical ingredients for improved memory
      enhancement and/or cognitive performance. While the individual ingredients are already
      well-utilized in commerce globally, the Braini® formulation is unique and novel, harnessing
      synergistic effects seen in a new in vitro human neural cell challenge study carried out in
      South Korea by the study sponsor. In this study a series of independent in vitro (cell line)
      tests of the active nutraceutical constituents that comprise the Braini® dietary supplement
      product line were performed. The tests follow current peer-reviewed published methods for
      assessing the effects of biologically active compounds on human neuronal cells. The in vitro
      study showed a significant improvement in cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      inhibition using the Braini® compounds.

      Based on existing published science supporting the neuroprotective role of the Braini®
      formulation, this supplement may be useful and to improve cognitive function and health.
      Based on studies conducted outside the United States, the research team hypothesizes that
      orally ingested Braini® taken as directed (2 x 525 mg powdered capsules per day), will
      demonstrate superior improvements in standardized cognitive performance assays and related
      MOCA scores. The research team aims to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blinded dietary supplement study to evaluate this hypothesis among a diverse sample of
      healthy young adults

    <masking_description>Participants and study personnel will be blinded to group assignment. Study personnel will receive 24 bottles each of either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;placebo&quot; product from the supplier. The bottles would be numbered sequentially from 101 to 148. Within that sequence, randomized blocks of 4 bottles each would be filled with either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;placebo&quot; product, for a total of 12 blocks. The bottler will not reveal to anyone which bottles got filled with which type of product until after the conclusion of the trial. Except for having a different sequential number on the label, the bottles will be indistinguishable.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.
The MoCA is a test of various types of cognitive abilities including orientation (e.g., state the date), short-term memory, executive function (e.g., draw a copy of a cube shape), language abilities (e.g., repeating two sentences correctly followed by listing all the words in the sentences that started with &quot;f&quot;), abstraction (e.g., explain how two things are alike), animal naming, attention (e.g., repeat a series of numbers forward), and clock-drawing (e.g., draw a clock that reads a specified time)</description>

    <description>The CBS Health Assessment is a 30-minute computer test assessing various aspects of cognitive functioning including visual/spatial working memory, episodic memory, spatial short-term memory, verbal reasoning, deductive reasoning, visual/spatial processing, planning and mental rotation. For all tests, after three mistakes, the task ends. Scores are normed for age and gender and results presented as percentiles for each of seven domains.</description>
