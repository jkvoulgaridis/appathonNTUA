      This study aims to see if mobile video clips (smartphone recordings) can be used to screen
      children with Down syndrome to identify those at highest risk of obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA), so they can be prioritized for an earlier sleep study. Parents will be asked to record
      short video clips of their child sleeping, and then rate whether they think their child has
      OSA. Later, children will undergo a sleep study to compare to the ratings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down syndrome have approximately a 50% chance of developing obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) in their lifetime. OSA is a serious condition where a person stops breathing
      periodically during sleep; it is associated with high blood pressure, behavioural issues, and
      lower quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical, but the best way to
      diagnose OSA, a 'sleep study', is in short supply. Given the limited resources, this study
      aims to see if mobile video clips (smartphone recordings) can be used to screen children with
      Down syndrome to identify those at highest risk of OSA, so they can be prioritized for an
      earlier sleep study.

      Parents of children with Down syndrome, recruited from clinic, will be asked to record short
      video clips of their child sleeping. Parents will independently rate whether they think their
      child has OSA and how severe it is, based on the videos, as will two clinicians. Parents will
      also watch an educational webinar and be asked to re-rate the presence and severity of OSA in
      their child, to see if the webinar improves their accuracy. Finally, children will undergo a
      sleep study to compare to the ratings. This study will help determine whether videos can be
      used to accurately screen for OSA in this high risk population, prioritizing children for
      earlier diagnosis and treatment.

    <description>Questionnaire developed at CHEO by Pediatric Respirologists and Otolaryngologists. The question of interest is &quot;Do you think your child has obstructive sleep apnea?&quot; The reviewer (a parent) will choose 'Yes' or 'No' after reviewing the homemade video clips. This is a dichotomous outcome with 'Yes' considered as the highest score. The gold standard reference test will be a polysomnography.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire developed at CHEO by Pediatric Respirologists and Otolaryngologists. The question of interest is &quot;Do you believe the severity of the obstructive sleep apnea is: a) Mild, b) Moderate, or c) Severe ?&quot; This question will only appear to parents who chose 'Yes' for the primary outcome. The reviewer will answer the question after reviewing the homemade video clips. This is an ordinal outcome with 'Mild' being considered the lowest score (1), and 'Severe' being considered the highest score (3). The gold standard reference test will be a polysomnography.</description>

        The study population will consist of children with Down syndrome who have not previously
        been diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing. We will approach children followed at the
        CHEO Down Syndrome clinic to participate in this study. All children within CHEO's
        catchment area will be considered eligible for this study.
