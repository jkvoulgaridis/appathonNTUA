  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate the effect of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics (the
      breakdown of the drug in the body) of parallel-group, multiple oral doses nalbuphine extended
      release (NAL ER), tablets in people with liver disease (mild, moderate and severe), compared
      to people with normal liver function. The study will also test the safety and tolerability of
      the NAL ER, when it is given to subjects with mild, moderate and severe liver disease,
      compared to subjects with normal liver function. This protocol will also study the effects of
      this drug on itching in liver disease subjects if they report some itching prior to taking
      part in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three-center study that will include both a single-ascending-dose (SAD)
      portion and a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion. The PK, safety, and tolerability of
      single ascending doses (SAD) of NAL ER (4 dose levels) will be evaluated in subjects with
      mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment.

      The purpose of the SAD will be to assess the safety and PK parameters of the given dose
      levels in hepatic impaired subjects relative to a selected healthy subject control population
      as part of the overall NAL ER development program. The SAD will also allow a better
      understanding of the safety, tolerability and expected steady state PK characteristics in
      mild and moderate hepatic impairment prior to undertaking safety and itch suppression
      efficacy studies in this patient population.

      In the MAD portion of this study, PK assessment will be carried out at steady state at each
      respective dose level at steady state during the titration over 13 days up to the highest
      planned therapeutic dose of 162 mg. It is well documented, in clinical practice and the
      opiate literature, that gradually increasing the dose of drug with a structured titration can
      reduce the frequency and severity of the expected AEs associated with initiation of therapy.
      The NAL ER clinical program utilizes this type of structured titration strategy, starting
      with once per day dosing at the 27 mg dose of NAL ER, and increasing the dose in a stepwise
      manner over the next 13 days to the target investigational dose of 162 mg twice daily.
      Pharmacokinetic steady state is reached

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 1, open-label PK and safety study of NAL ER in subjects with impaired liver function compared to healthy subjects. It will be performed in 2 parts:
Part 1: single-ascending-dose (SAD) cohorts
Part 2: multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) cohort
In Part 1 (SAD)-Dose Cohorts 1-5: Each of the cohorts will be dosed sequentially starting with the lowest dose. The drug kinetics in the hepatic impairment subject population will be compared relative to the healthy subject population (Cohort 5).
Part 2 (MAD) - Dose Cohort 6: 6-8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 6-8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment In Part 2 of the study (MAD), subjects will receive multiple doses ascending from 27 mg up to 162 mg over 13 days of dosing.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>WI-NRS measure will be used to determine the severity of itch experienced by subjects with hepatic impairment (for Cohort 6 only) at screening. Subjects will be completing the two forms (the &quot;Night-time Itch&quot; and the &quot;Daytime Itch&quot;) at the same time during the screening visit and the average will be taken to determine the baseline severity. The scale is a 0 to 10 rating scale with 10 being the most severe itch experienced and 0 being no itching experienced.</description>
