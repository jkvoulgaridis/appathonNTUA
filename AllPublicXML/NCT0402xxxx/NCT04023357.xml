  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients need Endocrowns for their teeth usually use Emax as an etchable ceramic. Yet they
      have disadvantages that may influence the outcome of the endocrowns, among which is the high
      stiffness and rigidity owing to the higher modulus of elasticity (67.2 GPa)( compared to
      natural dentin (18.6 GPa) which may affect the marginal adaptation.so a less rigid material
      is needed. PEEKs (polyetheretherketones) are presented as alternative materials to metal and
      glass ceramics, Their elastic modulus comparable to those of cortical bone and dentin so the
      polymer could exhibit good stress distribution. Also they have high fracture resistance, and
      low abrasion to the antagonist enamel.

      .but the investigators have to know clinically it is performance , so the investigators are
      going to have Parallel groups in a randomized clinical trial.
