      ABSTRACT Objective: Periodontitis and peri-implantitis are the irreversible destructive
      diseases of the periodontal and peri-implant tissues. The present study aimed to determine
      the receptor expressions of Peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, Retinoid X
      receptor (RXR)-α, and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the diseased tissues around teeth and
      dental implants.

      Methods: The study consisted of three groups as group 1; healthy controls (C, n=15), group 2;
      periodontitis patients with stage 3 grade B (P, n=15), and group 3; peri-implantitis patients
      (PI, n=15). Periodontal clinical parameters as the plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and
      clinical attachment levels (CAL) were recorded. Gingival biopsies were obtained from all
      participants and biopsy samples underwent histological tissue processing. Hematoxylin-eosin
      (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemistry staining were performed. Total inflammatory cell counts and
      fibroblast cell density were evaluated on H&amp;E-stained slides while PPAR-γ, RXR-α, and VDR
      were evaluated via immunohistochemistry.

    <description>Gingival biopsies were obtained from all participants and biopsy samples underwent histological tissue processing. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining were performed. Total inflammatory cell counts density were evaluated on H&amp;E-stained slides.A cell counting frame of 10.000 µm2 area was selected under 1000x magnification. The total inflammatory cells (neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and macrophage cells) within the frame were counted as inflammatory cell counting.</description>
