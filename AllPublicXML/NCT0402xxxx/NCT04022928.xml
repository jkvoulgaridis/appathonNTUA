  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been reported to be an effective treatment for knee
      osteoarthritis (OA). The application in ankle OA has rarely been investigated. The aim was to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single intraarticular injection of PRP for the
      treatment of patients with ankle OA.

      Methods: In a prospective study, patients with symptomatic ankle OA for at least 6 months
      were recruited. Patients received a single injection of 3-ml of PRP into symptomatic ankles.
      The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score
      (0-10cm) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) score,
      American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle/hindfoot score, single leg stance
      test (SLS), use of rescue analgesics and patient satisfaction. Adverse events were recorded
      during the study.

      Patients were followed at 1, 3 and 6 months postinjection .

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>visual analog scale (VAS) of ankle pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient rated the average severity of ankle pain on ankle movement over the previous week on a 10-cm VAS (0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AOS score is a validated patient-rated outcome measure that contains a nine-item pain subscale and a nine-item disability subscale. Using the AOS, a score of 0 represent no pain or disability and 10 represent worst pain or disability imaginable</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle/hindfoot score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>a 100-point scale that devotes 40 points to pain, 50 points to function and 10 points to alignment. The maximum score of 100 points denotes no pain and normal function and alignment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The single-leg stance (SLS) test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>SLS test involved raising the unaffected foot, without touching it to the affected lower extremity, and maintaining balance for as long as possible. Each participant performed three trials, and the best result was recorded</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>use of analgesic medication</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>global satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients rated his or her level of global satisfaction relative to the state before the treatment, using a 100 mm VAS (0= completely dissatisfied, 100=completely satisfied)</description>
