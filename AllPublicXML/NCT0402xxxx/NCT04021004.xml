  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A self-designed qualitative questionnaire survey was used to investigate opinions and views
      among thirty Physiotherapists practising in the UK, who had undertaken formal training in
      Pilates exercise therapy to treat people with MSK conditions.

    <textblock>
      Pilates is a popular exercise therapy approach that focuses on strength, core stability,
      flexibility, muscle control, and posture (Wells et al., 2014). This approach has evolved over
      time, to form a valuable therapeutic tool in the prevention and rehabilitation of a variety
      of injuries (Di Lorenzo, 2011). More recently, Pilates has become increasingly popular due to
      its wide-ranging health benefits for individuals with a range of MSK (musculoskeletal)
      disorders, as well as other conditions (Byrnes, Wu, &amp; Whillier, 2018). This method has become
      more commercially recognised and accessible through various professional institutions. The
      Australian Physiotherapy &amp; Pilates Institute (APPI), is a globally run organisation licensed
      in sixteen countries, delivering over 17000 classes per year, as a &quot;graduated system of
      specific exercise rehabilitation&quot; (Appihealthgroup.com, 2018).

      In the UK, Pilates based exercise therapy is used within both the National Health Service
      (NHS) and private healthcare sectors in the management of low back pain (LBP), general MSK
      pain, and various degenerative conditions (Yamato et al. 2015). An estimated 17.8 million
      people live with a musculoskeletal condition in the UK, around 28.9% of the total population
      (Global Burden of Disease network, 2016). Over 8.75 million people aged 45 and over have
      sought treatment for osteoarthritis (Arthritis Research UK, 2013), for which the main
      management strategy is exercise-based therapy. MSK healthcare services are under increasing
      pressure to provide care to the ageing population, and tackle the healthcare impact
      associated with inactivity (Hubbard et al., 2004). Group based exercise such as class
      Pilates, offers an accessible opportunity to increase activity levels in such individuals
      (Karlsson, Gerdle, Takala, Andersson, &amp; Larsson, 2018).

      There is considerable evidence that Pilates has numerous physical benefits and may improve
      self-management of MSK conditions. This includes a wealth of quantitative research, several
      systematic reviews have demonstrated positive improvements on pain, quality of life and
      functionality (Aladro-Gonzalvo, Araya-Vargas, Machado-DÃ­az, &amp; Salazar-Rojas, 2013; Byrnes et
      al., 2018). However, of the Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) reviewed, high levels of
      heterogeneity were reported, in terms of sample (sub-types of back pain), exercise selection,
      delivery and frequency of treatment.

      In contrast to this, there is a dearth of qualitative research evaluating Pilates as a
      treatment approach, mostly focusing on LBP populations (Gaskell &amp; Williams, 2018). These
      methods can be valuable to review the definition, scope and rationale of Pilates treatment
      methods used by Physiotherapists, to provide optimum rehabilitation. Use of a qualitative
      approach could also gain understanding of how Physiotherapists utilise Pilates for a range of
      conditions other than LBP (Wells et al., 2014). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the
      variation in Pilates delivery and why, and in line with previous qualitative studies, further
      explore the perceived benefits, risks and rationale for this exercise approach. This is the
      first study to review NHS and private physiotherapists in their use of Pilates group
      exercise.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To participate in the study and complete the survey, it was specified that
             participants needed to:

               1. Have undertaken some form of formal Pilates instruction training, such as the
                  Matwork Foundation Pilates courses with the APPI (Australian Physiotherapy and
                  Pilates Institute) or BCP (Body Control Pilates, 2018). Physiotherapists did not
                  have to be a fully certified instructor to participate in the study, however,
                  they must have completed a minimum of one formal Pilates Instruction course.
                  Participants were required to specify this in the demographics section of the
                  survey.

               2. Be registered with the HCPC (Health and Care Professions council) to currently
                  practice as a Physiotherapist without restriction in the UK. The reasoning for
                  only surveying Physiotherapists is in keeping with the rationale of previous
                  studies (Wells et al., 2014; Allen, 2014; Brennan and French, 2008). Who have
                  advocated that including only Physiotherapists with formal Pilates training
                  guarantees similar standards of practice of participants, as standards and
                  qualification level may vary otherwise. Additionally, extending the survey to
                  other practioners would make further comparisons challenging through data
                  analysis.

               3. Be computer literate, have e-mail access, time to commit to completion of the
                  survey, and ability to understand written English language.
