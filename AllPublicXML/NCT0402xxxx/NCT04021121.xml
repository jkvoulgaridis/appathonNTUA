  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized open-label trial of high versus standard dose rifampin (RIF)
      with or without linezolid (LZD) for the first 4 weeks of treatment for Tuberculosis
      Meningitis (TBM) at Masaka Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. Initial randomization will
      be to high (35 mg/kg/day) versus standard (10 mg/kg/day) dose oral rifampin for the first 4
      weeks of intensive therapy. Participants will then undergo a second randomization to
      linezolid 1200 mg daily versus no linezolid for the first 4 weeks of therapy. The primary
      aims are (1) to determine the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma pharmacokinetics of adjunctive
      LZD 1200 mg daily in TBM patients receiving high or standard dose RIF and (2) to evaluate the
      tolerability of a 4-week course of LZD in TBM patients.

    <measure>Neurocognitive Battery Performance: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Either the HVLT-R or WHO-UCLA AVLT will be used to assess verbal learning and memory. In the HVLT-R Participants are asked to recall a list of 12 words. It includes four subscales: total recall, delayed recall, retention score, and recognition discrimination index. The total recall score indicates the number of correctly reported words in 3 learning trials, with a subscale ranging from 0-36. The delayed recall subscale, ranging from 0-12, indicates the number of correctly reported words in the delayed recall trial. The retention score represents the score on the delayed recall test divided by the higher of the recall scores from learning trials 2 and 3, multiplied by 100. The recognition discrimination index (RDI) is calculated by subtracting the total false positives score (semantically-related plus semantically un-related) from the total true-positives score obtained in the delayed recognition test. For all subscales, higher values indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Battery Performance: World Health Organization-University of California-Los Angeles Auditory Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Either the HVLT-R or WHO-UCLA AVLT will be used to assess verbal learning and memory. The WHO-UCLA AVLT includes a 15 word list learned over five trials (subscale from 0-75), an interference trial (subscale from 0-15), and a 20 minute delayed recall trial (subscale from 0-15). A final delayed recognition trial is performed immediately after delayed recall. The retention score represents the score on the delayed recall test divided by the higher of the recall scores from learning trials 2-5, multiplied by 100. The recognition discrimination index (RDI) is calculated by subtracting the total false positives score from the total true-positives score obtained in the delayed recognition test. For all subscales, higher values indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance (Conditional).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Completed if participant is unable to undergo the full neurocognitive test battery. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening tool used to detect mild neurocognitive disability. It assesses six key areas of cognitive ability: short-term memory, visuospatial abilities, executive functions, language, orientation to time and place, and attention, concentration and working memory. The assessment has 11 scored sections, summed for a total score ranging from 0-30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Age &gt; 18 years

          2. Written informed consent from participant or proxy

          3. Definite, probable, possible, or suspected TBM diagnosis wherein the patient is being
             committed to a full course of anti-TB treatment for TBM in the setting of routine
             care.

        All participants must have at least one of the following signs/symptoms: headache,
        irritability, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, convulsions, focal neurological deficits,
        altered consciousness, or lethargy. In addition, participants must have CSF glucose to
        plasma ratio &lt; 0.5 OR positive CSF acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear OR positive CSF GeneXpert
        or Xpert Ultra OR clinician intent to initiate TB treatment for suspected TB meningitis.

        Definite, probable and possible TBM will be defined as:

        Definite TBM is defined by the presence of one or more of the following:

          -  Acid- fast bacilli (AFB) seen in the CSF, M tuberculosis cultured from CSF, or a CSF M
             tuberculosis-positive nucleic acid amplification test (e.g., Gene Xpert Ultra)
             performed within 14 days of entry

          -  AFB seen in the context of histological changes consistent with tuberculosis in the
             brain with suggestive symptoms or signs and CSF changes.

        Probable and possible TBM are defined using previously published consensus criteria as
        shown in Appendix A45.

          -  Probable TBM is defined as a total score of ≥12 when neuroimaging is available or
             total score of ≥10 when neuroimaging is unavailable. At least two points should either
             come from CSF or cerebral imaging criteria.

          -  Possible TBM is defined as a total score of 6-11 when neuroimaging is available, or
             total score of 6-9 when neuroimaging is unavailable.

        Exclusion of the most likely alternative diagnoses is also required (e.g., negative
        cryptococcal antigen). Because culture confirmation is rarely available or often delayed in
        TBM, patients with probable or possible TBM will be recruited based on these predefined
        criteria, and CSF will be collected for mycobacterial culture and molecular testing.
        Classification of participants as definite, probable, or possible TBM will be made
        retrospectively once all necessary data are available.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. &gt;5 doses of TB treatment received within previous 5 days

          2. Discontinued TB treatment in prior 14 days

          3. Known current/previous drug resistant TB infection

          4. Known allergy to RIF, INH, PZA, EMB, LZD

          5. Previous treatment of TB or TBM with LZD

          6. Concomitant or planned use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin
             reuptake inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, or any other drug with significant
             interaction with RIF, LZD, or any TB drugs (see Appendices C and D)

          7. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or women or men of reproductive potential who
             are unwilling to use at least one reliable form of barrier contraception or to abstain
             from sexual activity while receiving study drug treatment and for 30 days after
             stopping study treatment. Acceptable forms of contraception include: condoms (male or
             female) with or without a spermicidal agent, or diaphragm or cervical cap with
             spermicide. Hormonal contraception is not recommended as it may be ineffective due to
             induction of metabolism when receiving rifampicin.

          8. Unwillingness to be an inpatient for 2 weeks for initial treatment or to attend follow
             up clinic visits

          9. Lack of informed consent from participant or next of kin/caregiver

         10. Serum creatinine &gt;1.8 times upper limit of normal, hemoglobin &lt;7.0 g/dL for men, &lt;6.5
             g/dL for women, platelet count &lt;50,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count &lt;600/mm3,
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin &gt;2
             times the upper limit of normal.

         11. Severe peripheral neuropathy defined by Grade 3 symptoms AND vibratory loss OR absent
             ankle jerks for participants able to undergo the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen
             (see Appendix B).

         12. Contraindication to LP, including PLT &lt;50 cells/mm3 or unequal pressures between
             intracranial compartments (e.g., due to mass lesion, non-communicating hydrocephalus),
             or unwillingness to undergo or consent to LP
