    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate diagnostic accuracy of median nerve strain and
      applied pressure measurement . Idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients and healthy
      controls will be evaluated by ultrasound. Median nerve strain, pressure applied to the skin
      will be measured at the proximal part of the carpal tunnel. The parameters will be compared
      between patients and controls, and before and after the open carpal tunnel release in the
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to investigate diagnostic accuracy of median nerve strain and
      applied pressure measurement . Idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients and healthy
      controls will be evaluated by ultrasound. Median nerve strain, pressure applied to the skin,
      and ratio of pressure-strain will be measured at the proximal part of the carpal tunnel. In
      addition, distal latencies in the motor and sensory nerve conductions studies and
      cross-sectional area of median nerve will be measured. The parameters will be compared
      between patients and controls, and before and after the open carpal tunnel release in the
      patients.
