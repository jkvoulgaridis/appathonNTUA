  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and ocular safety of bromfenac ophthalmic solution (bromfenac) 0.1%
      dosed twice daily for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain after pterygium excision
      with amniotic membrane transplantation(AMT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled to undergo pterygium excision with AMT were randomized to receive added
      topical bromfenac or artificial lacrima at 3 days before and 7 days after the surgery. Pain
      intensity was evaluated with the visual analog scale(VAS) and present pain index(PPI) with
      the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. psychological state used Self-rating of
      Depression Scale(SDS) and Self-rating of Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess. Ocular inflammation
      was assessed with an automated bulbar redness grading technique. The irritative symptoms
      evaluation was carried out by an independent investigator at each visit with questionnaires
      of ocular symptom scores(OSS). Corneal epithelial healing rate was calculated after following
      up. All patients had follow-ups at the day 1, day 3, day7 and day 10.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>visual analog scale(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline VAS at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS pain score provides an intensity score of the pain experienced. The VAS allows the patient to self-rate his or her pain on a 0 to 10 horizontal grading scale of subjective pain assessment with 0 as &quot;no pain at all&quot; and 10 being &quot;the most severe intolerable pain I have ever experienced.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>present pain intensity index(PPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PPI at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PPI scale is a measure of the magnitude of pain experienced by an individual and is a six-point verbal rating scale that indicates overall pain intensity and includes six levels (0, none; 1, mild; 2, discomforting; 3, distressing; 4, horrible; and 5, excruciating). Higher numbers indicate more severe pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>corneal epithelium healing(CEH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline corneal epithelial defect at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Took the anterior segment photography and slit lamp examination parallel sodium fluorescein staining. The corneal epithelial defect area was stained with fluorescein sodium. Corneal epithelial healing rate is obtained by calculating the difference of the corneal epithelial defect area on day1 from day10, then divided by days.</description>

    <measure>Inflammation Evaluation by temporal conjunctival hyperaemia index (TCHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline TCHI at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed with an automated bulbar redness grading technique, the Oculus Keratographâ—‹R5M (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) by temporal conjunctival hyperaemia index (TCHI). The Oculus Keratograph 5M returns redness using a clinical grading scale of 0.0-4.0 in 0.1 steps.we choose TCHI to evaluate the degree of ocular inflammation, which the grade of 1.2 or less is considered a physiologic degree of bulbar redness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms Evaluation by ocular symptom scores(OSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline OSS at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The irritative symptoms evaluation by ocular symptom scores(OSS),which was carried out by an independent investigator at each visit with questionnaires of ocular symptom scores(OSS), which included grading of their symptoms (pain, foreign body sensation, burning sensation, visual fatigue and dryness) using a 4-point scale. The patients determine the quality of irritative symptom by selecting one of the options: None = 0, Perceptible or intermittent fatigue=1, Obvious visual fatigue but tolerable=2, Apparent visual fatigue and hard to bear=3. Higher numbers indicate more severe irritative symptom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>psychological state changes of depression was evaluated with Self-rating Depression Scale(SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline SDS at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>In the main component of the SDS , patients are asked 20 questions about Mental and physical feelings of emotional experience, and the patients determine the quality of emotion by selecting one of the options: Occasionally=1, sometimes=2, often=3, and continuously=4. 10 questions are scored forward, the other 10 questions are scored backward. The total score is multiplied by an integer of 1.25 to get the standard score. According to Chinese norms, the cut-off value of SDS standard score is 53, 53-62 is mild, 63-72 is moderate, over 72 is severe, and lower than 53 belongs to the normal.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline SAS at 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>In the main component of the SAS , patients are asked 20 questions about Mental and physical feelings of emotional experience, and the patients determine the quality of emotion by selecting one of the options: Occasionally=1, sometimes=2, often=3, and continuously=4. 10 questions are scored forward, the other 10 questions are scored backward.
