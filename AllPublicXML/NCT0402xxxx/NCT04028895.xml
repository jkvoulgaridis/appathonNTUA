  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no reliable, diagnostic tests of insulin resistance other than the
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp which, due to its constraints and cost, is reserved for
      research. The insulin-Regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) protein is a direct marker of
      insulin-dependent glucose cell capture and thus it blood concentration seems to be a good
      diagnostic test of insulin resistance.

      The purpose of this study is to assess a plasma essay of IRAP protein for evaluation of
      insulin resistance during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

      This study consists of two visits, from three to fifteen days apart. Patients with different
      levels of insulin resistance will be enrolled in this study.

      The level of insulin resistance will be estimated with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
      that will be performed at the second visit.

      The first visit :

        -  Subjects will be on an empty stomach

        -  A blood test including HbA1C, C-Peptid, lipid profile, creatinine,urea, hepatic workup

        -  An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 3 hours will be performed. Blood samples will
           be taken two time (T-15', T0) 15 minutes apart at Baseline (before taking the glucose).
           And then after the glucose intake, blood sample will be taken every 15 minutes (T15',
           T30', T 45', T60', T75', T90', T105', T120' and 180') to measure insulinemia, blood
           sugar, and IRAP concentration.

      The second visit includes a 3-hours hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.
