  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JTZ-951 is a currently being developed as a treatment for renal anemia. This study aims to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of JTZ-951 following a switch from
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) in Korean subjects receiving HemoDialysis with renal
      anemia.

      This study is a Phase III, open, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study.

      The total duration of the study will be 30 weeks including screening, treatment and
      follow-up.
