  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to evaluate the ability of the V.A.C. ULTA™ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy
      System and V.A.C. VERAFLO CLEANSE CHOICE ™ (VFCC) dressing system with saline as an irrigant
      in increasing viable tissue in full thickness wounds (such as chronic, acute, traumatic,
      sub-acute, and dehisced wounds and/or ulcers) with difficult to manage bioburden and slough.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. is anticipated to be hospitalized for the duration of treatment.

          2. is ≥22 years of age or their legally authorized representative is able to provide
             informed consent.

          3. has a full thickness wound (such as chronic, acute, traumatic, sub-acute, and dehisced
             wounds and/or ulcers) measuring ≥4cm in length and ≥4cm in width (before removal of
             eschar at the bedside) excluding undermining/tunneling.

          4. has, in the opinion of the investigator, no more than 2/3 of the visible wound bed
             surface area considered to be clean, healthy, and viable. If eschar is present at
             baseline, it must be removed by bedside debridement prior to assessing the percentage
             of clean, healthy, and viable wound bed.

          5. has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening (if female and has potential
             for pregnancy) and is willing to take precautionary measures to prevent pregnancy
             during the duration of the study (up to 9 days).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. has been diagnosed with malignancy in the wound.

          2. has untreated osteomyelitis.

          3. has an untreated systemic infection.

          4. has active cellulitis in the peri wound area.

          5. has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to study materials: dressing and/or dressing
             components such as acrylic adhesives or polyurethane.

          6. has, in the opinion of the investigator, a clinically significant condition that would
             impair the Subject's ability to comply with the study procedures.

          7. has had radiation directly to the wound.

          8. has been diagnosed with a major vascular deficit limiting arterial inflow to the wound
             region, as determined by the Investigator's interpretation of the Subject's medical
             history.

          9. has eschar in the wound that cannot be removed by beside or sharp and/or mechanical
             debridement.

         10. is participating in another interventional clinical trial for the duration of the
             study.

         11. has unexplored fistulas in the wound or fistulas in the wound that connect to other
             body cavities.

         12. has inadequate hemostasis at the wound site, as determined by the investigator.
