      Randomized comparison of radiation exposure in coronary angiography between right
      conventional and left distal radial artery approach
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The left snuffbox approach is expected to be easier to perform because of less severe
      tortuosity of the clavicle artery. However, clinical validation of the snuffbox approach was
      not completed compared with the conventional radial approach. Especially, there is no
      clinical data on the comparison of the radiation dose in both approaches. To date, there have
      been some studies on the radiation dose between the left and right radial artery and femoral
      artery puncture site, but no studies have been conducted on the left snuffbox approach.

      The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation doses of the two interventional
      radiologists by randomly assigning coronary angiography to the left snuffbox approach and
      right conventional radial approach.

    <description>After local anesthesia on right wrist area with lidocaine hydrochloride using a 26 gauge needle, the puncture is performed using a 20 gauge needle with the through-and-through puncture technique or a 21 gauge open needle with anterior wall puncture technique. After the successful puncture, 0.025-inch straight wire or 0.018-inch hair wire are inserted, followed by insertion of the 5Fr. radial sheath (Prelude® Radial; Merit medical, UT, USA or Radifocus® Introducer II or Glidesheath Slender®; Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</description>

    <description>We will perform coronary angiography through a Judkins 5 French diagnostic catheter and will take a basic view. At the end of the examination, the radial sheath is removed and the right conventional radial approach is performed for about 4 hours and the left snuffbox approach for about 2 hours using the compressive bandage method. The hemostatic device will use ez ClotRadial® (SOYEON medical Co., Ltd., Wonju, Korea).</description>
