    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of CYD-TDV in pregnant women and their offsprings inadvertently
      exposed during pregnancy or up to 30 days preceding their last menstrual period (LMP) with
      regards to maternal, pregnancy, birth, neonatal and infant outcomes. Specifically, the
      frequency/rates of these outcomes will be: (i) described, and (ii) compared with
      population-level background incidence rates prior to the introduction of CYD-TDV immunization
      (i.e., external unvaccinated comparator).

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe:

        -  the characteristics of women exposed to CYD-TDV during pregnancy or up to 30 days before
           the LMP

        -  the characteristics of CYD-TDV pregnancy exposure with regards to number of doses, dose
           intervals, and trimester of exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non -interventional (observational) post authorization safety study (PASS): no
      vaccine will be administered as part of the study.

      This pregnancy registry study is a combination of a retrospective (outcomes occurred before
      the start of participant enrollment) and prospective (outcomes occurred after the start of
      participant enrollment) cohort study using active identification and enrollment of pregnant
      women and their offsprings inadvertently exposed to CYD-TDV during pregnancy or up to 30 days
      preceding the LMP.

      The study period will be from July 2016 (first availability of Paraná's Immunization
      Registry) to July 2022 (end of last follow-up interview for offsprings), and the participant
      enrollment period will last approximately 1 year.

      Study duration per participant will vary depending on: 1) the stage of pregnancy at the time
      the participant will be enrolled; 2) whether the participant will be included retrospectively
      or prospectively. The maximum duration will be 22.5 months (up to 9 months of pregnancy + 42
      days post-delivery [puerperium period] + 12 months post-birth).

        Eligible pregnant women of any age residing in Paraná who received at least one dose of
        CYD-TDV during pregnancy or up to 30 days preceding LMP and the offsprings resulting from
        those pregnancies. The study could also be extended to other regions and states of Brazil.

          -  CYD-TDV exposed pregnant women of any age residing in the 30 municipalities of Paraná
             where public vaccination campaigns have been offered at the time of their pregnancy
             exposure, and whose pregnancy exposure was reported to Brazil's AEFI PV database
             (SI-PNI AEPV).

          -  Valid contact information (in SI-PNI AEPV).

             assent form (AF) (based on local regulations), and/or a signed and dated ICF by the
             parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative (and by an independent witness if
             required by local regulations) if a minor (women who meet the inclusion criteria and

             sensitivity analysis).
