    <textblock>
      SJELIOT is a phase 1 trial that aims to explore the combination of prexasertib with
      established DNA-damaging agents used in medulloblastoma to evaluate tolerance and
      pharmacokinetics in recurrent or refractory disease. Additionally, a small expansion cohort
      will be incorporated into the trial at the combination MTD/RP2D (maximum tolerated
      dose/recommended phase two dose) to detect a preliminary efficacy signal.

      Stratum A: Prexasertib and Cyclophosphamide

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of combination treatment with prexasertib and
           cyclophosphamide in participants with recurrent/refractory Group 3 and Group 4
           medulloblastoma and recurrent/refractory sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of prexasertib in combination with
           cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To estimate the rate and duration of objective response and progression free survival
           (PFS) associated with prexasertib and cyclophosphamide treatment in this patient
           population.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and metabolites.

      Stratum B: Prexasertib and Gemcitabine

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the MTD/RP2D of combination
           treatment with prexasertib and gemcitabine in participants with recurrent/refractory
           Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of prexasertib in combination with gemcitabine.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To estimate the rate and duration of objective response and PFS associated with
           prexasertib and gemcitabine treatment in this patient population.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and gemcitabine triphosphate (only
           at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital).

      Participants will be stratified by the biological characteristics of their tumor to one of
      two treatment strata:

      STRATUM A

        -  Combination Treatment: prexasertib and cyclophosphamide

        -  Patient population: Participants with recurrent/refractory Group 3 and Group 4 (G3/G4)
           medulloblastoma, recurrent/refractory sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma and
           medulloblastoma participants with Indeterminate molecular subgroup

      STRATUM B

        -  Combination Treatment: prexasertib and gemcitabine

        -  Patient population: Participants with recurrent/refractory Group 3 and Group 4
           medulloblastoma

      Participants with a diagnosis of G3/G4 medulloblastoma who qualify for both treatment strata
      will be assigned per slot availability as well as institutional PI preference. If slots are
      available in both stratum A and stratum B, patients will be assigned to the dose level
      nearest completion.

      The Rolling 6 design will be used separately in each stratum to estimate the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase two dose (RP2D). Therapy will be administered in
      cycles of 28 days and may be continued for up to 24 months (26 cycles) in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants will receive doublet therapy in cycles of 28 days. The dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT)-evaluation period will consist of the first cycle until day 1 criteria of cycle 2 has
      been met. Participants will be evaluated at least once a week during the DLT-evaluation
      period and at regular intervals thereafter. Standard tests (i.e. physical exams, blood tests,
      and disease evaluations) will be undertaken at regular intervals. Research-associated
      evaluations (i.e. pharmacokinetic studies, etc.) will also be carried out during therapy.
      Treatment may be continued for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is empirically defined as the highest dose level at which six patients have been treated with at most one patient experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next higher dose level has been determined to be too toxic. The MTD estimate will not be available if the lowest dose level studied is too toxic or the highest dose level studied is considered safe. In the latter case, the highest studied safe dose may be considered as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The MTD estimation will be limited to evaluable patients and toxicity assessments from course 1 (28 days).</description>
