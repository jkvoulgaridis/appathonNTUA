  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress in the time taken to take charge and in the quality of the surgical
      technique, the repair of damaged peripheral nerves has not improved in the last twenty years.
      Faced with these limitations of surgical treatment, multidisciplinary teams from Marseille
      and Rouen have come together to propose an innovative approach to cell therapy that can limit
      inflammation and improve axonal growth.

      Cell transplantation now appears as an alternative to treat nerve damage. Scientific advances
      have shown in animal models as well as in humans that mesenchymal stem cells are good
      cellular candidates for supporting nerve regeneration after transplantation. On the other
      hand, their collection requires an invasive sample most often of bone marrow. A new stem cell
      candidate capable of stimulating nerve regeneration has recently been identified in the
      olfactory mucosa located in the nasal cavity. These cells are part of the &quot;ecto-mesenchymal&quot;
      stem cell family. They have biological characteristics very similar to those of mesenchymal
      stem cells of the bone marrow.

      They exhibit high mitogenic activity and have a high potential for differentiation towards
      neural lineages. Given their properties and ease of access within the nasal cavity,
      ecto-mesenchymal stem cells offer new perspectives for cell therapy targeting nerve damage.

      In this context, nasal ecto-mesenchymal stem cells represent an interesting reconstruction
      alternative, particularly in the indication of peripheral nerve lesions. They are directly
      and easily accessible to any individual. We therefore propose in this study to validate a
      method of manufacturing isolated stem cells from a biopsy of a few cubic millimeters of the
      nasal cavity of adults, taken during a surgical procedure, with a view to proposing shortly
      an innovative cell therapy. From each nasal biopsy taken, the cells will be amplified in
      vitro under pharmaceutical grade conditions and then controlled, validated and characterized
      in particular for their ability to differentiate into neural cells and for their lack of
      genetic instability. The cells will also be cryo-preserved and then thawed under
      pharmaceutical grade conditions in order to validate the maintenance of their quality after
      cryopreservation allowing to propose a delayed implantation according to the clinical
      context. This study requires the taking of 25 biopsies of nasal mucosa taken from adults to
      document the reproducibility of the manufacturing process and possible inter-donor
      variations. This validation data is an essential step before considering a clinical trial of
      Innovative Cell Therapy Drugs.
