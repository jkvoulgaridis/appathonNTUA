    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to demonstrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence
      of Biocon Insulin R with Humulin® R in healthy subjects.

      The treatment consists of one single dose of the test or reference product, administered
      during each of the two study periods, separated by 5-7 days between each dosing.

      The planned trial duration for each subject is about 12 to 36 days. Eligible subjects will
      undergo two 12-hour euglycaemic clamp examinations, one after administration of the test
      product and one after administration of the reference product in random order.

             Hg or &gt; 90 mmHg after resting for at least 5 minutes in supine position (excluding
