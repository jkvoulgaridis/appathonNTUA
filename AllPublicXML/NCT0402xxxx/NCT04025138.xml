  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute physiological consequences of ultra-marathon running are still unknown, particularly in
      women. Some studies have suggested that the proportion of fatigue attributable to peripheral
      and central mechanisms varies between males and females; however, results are contradictory.

      The results from the investigators of the present experiment in two studies conducted in 2009
      and 2012 showed that:

        -  A large part of fatigue induced by a mountain ultra-marathon could be attributed to
           central fatigue in males and that,

        -  Females exhibited less peripheral fatigue in the plantar flexors than males did after a
           110-km ultra-trail-running race.

      According to the literature, there seems to be a plateau in fatigue after 12-15 hours of
      running.

      Thus, the main purpose of the present project is to investigate whether sex differences in
      neuromuscular fatigue in plantar flexors depend on the distance (&gt; 100 km vs &lt; 60 km).
