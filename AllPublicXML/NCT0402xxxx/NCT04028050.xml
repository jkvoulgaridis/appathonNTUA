    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIIB, single-arm, single-country, multicenter study of the safety and
      efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus etoposide in patients who have
      ES-SCLC and are chemotherapy-naive for their extensive-stage disease.

      Induction treatment will be administered on a 21-day cycle for four/six cycles. Following the
      induction phase, participants will continue maintenance therapy with atezolizumab.
      Maintenance with atezolizumab will continue until disease progression (PD), unacceptable
      toxicity or loss of clinical benefit.

             Study Group (VALG) staging system

          -  Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can only
             be considered as measurable disease if disease progression has been unequivocally
             documented at that site since radiation and the previously irradiated lesion is not
             the only site of disease

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) from 0 to 2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

             diagnosis of ES-SCLC

          -  Patients where thoracic radiotherapy (consolidation RT) is clinically indicated could

             the beginning of maintenance phase

          -  Patients with Paraneoplastic syndromes can be enrolled if an autoimmune origin can be
             excluded

          -  Adequate hematologic and end organ function

             HBcAb test followed by a negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA test at screening

          -  Negative hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test at screening, or positive HCV antibody
             test followed by a negative HCV RNA test at screening. The HCV RNA test will be
