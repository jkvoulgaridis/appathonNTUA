  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open label, multicenter study of ALRN-6924 for the mitigation or
      reduction of topotecan-induced myelosuppression during 2nd-line treatment for ED SCLC
      harboring TP53 mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Phase 1b portion of the study, topotecan will be administered per standard
      practice on Days 1-5 of 21-day cycles. Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 initial
      ALRN-6924 dose levels, to be administered prior to each planned topotecan dose. The
      incidence, severity and duration of hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia,
      thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia, will be determined.

      The safety and tolerability of each ALRN-6924 dose level will be assessed during Phase 1b.

      If pre-determined criteria for safety and myelopreservation activity are met and the RP2D is
      identified, the Phase 2 portion of the study will be triggered. In Phase 2, patients with ED
      SCLC requiring 2nd line treatment with topotecan will be randomized 1:1 to either receive
      topotecan alone or topotecan with supportive ALRN-6924 treatment.

          -  Mutated TP53: no wild-type (WT) TP53 gene copies within the tumor (i.e., biallelic
             mutation, biallelic deletion or mutation/deletion), as assessed by next generation
             sequencing (NGS)

          -  Measurable disease using RECIST 1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2

          -  Adequate hematological status

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than one line of prior chemotherapy for ED SCLC (prior immunotherapy is
             permitted, concurrent with or subsequent to first line chemotherapy)

          -  Presence of active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis

          -  Significant weight loss (≥15% body weight) within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment
