  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic models of
      sevoflurane-induced sedation during ARDS depending on the lung imaging phenotype (focal vs
      nonfocal phenotypes) The authors hypothesized that sevoflurane used for inhaled sedation
      could have distinct pharmacokinetic profiles depending on lung imaging phenotypes (focal vs
      nonfocal) during ARDS in ICU patients.

      Adult patients admitted to the ICU within 12 hours of moderate-severe ARDS onset and under
      sedation with sevoflurane will be enrolled in the study with inclusion criteria. They will be
      enrolled, depending on their morphotype (focal or nonfocal), as routinely assessed in
      participating centers using CT-scan, chest x-ray and/or lung ultrasound.

      These patients will receive inhaled sevoflurane as a standard practice of sedation that is
      routinely used in participating ICUs. After inclusion, the mechanical ventilation protocol
      must be initiated within two hours (if not already being used). In both groups, deep sedation
      followed by neuromuscular blockade must be initiated within four hours of inclusion.

    <intervention_model_description>Inhaled sedation with sevoflurane, will be vaporized via the miniaturized Anesthesia Conserving Device (AnaConDa-S®, Sedana Medical, Uppsala, Sweden).
Sevoflurane infusion rate will be adapted from manufacturer's instructions in order to reach a target of expired sevoflurane fraction (FEsevo) of 0.8-1.1.
Mechanical ventilation will be protocolized in both arms, based on recent results of a RCT from our group, in which 90-day survival was improved in patients with nonfocal ARDS when an individualized ventilation strategy was applied, compared to the ARDSNet strategy (PEEP set according to FiO2). We will recommend sites wait at least 12 hours before proning, as in the PROSEVA study.
In both groups, patients will receive cisatracurium besylate for neuromuscular blockade, and deep sedation will be protocolized to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) of -4 to -5 (Ramsay of 5-6, or Riker of 1-2) before starting, and during, the cisatracurium besylate infusion.</intervention_model_description>
