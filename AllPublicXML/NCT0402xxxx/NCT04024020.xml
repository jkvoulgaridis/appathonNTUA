  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The longstanding view has been that insomnia, and other forms of sleep disturbance, emerge as
      a consequence of dementia and are the result of progressive neuronal damage. However, there
      is growing evidence that the direction of causation may go both ways, with sleep disturbance
      potentially increasing vulnerability to dementia. Longitudinal studies have found that sleep
      disturbance often precedes and increases risk for dementia by several years.The purpose of
      this study is to examine the relationship between chronic insomnia and dementia biomarkers
      and orexin levels found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Fifteen adults age 30-50 with chronic
      insomnia and age- and gender-matched good sleepers will undergo overnight polysomnography and
      CSF sampling in the morning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 30-50

          -  Men and women

          -  To be included in the insomnia group, subjects must meet the following DSM5 Diagnostic
             Criteria for insomnia disorder: dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality
             (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or waking up too early) despite adequate
             opportunity for sleep; sleep disturbance causes clinical significant distress or
             impairment in functioning; present at least 3 times per week for at least 3 months;
             sleep disturbance is not better explained by a medical or psychiatric condition or
             based on the effects of a substance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis or evidence of sleep disorders other than insomnia as determined by the
             screening questionnaires and clinical history

          -  Women who have been pregnant or lactating within the past six months

          -  Non-fluency in spoken or written English

          -  Current or past month shiftwork defined as working during the evening or night shift

          -  Current use of medications or OTC products that impact sleep

          -  Evidence of neurological abnormalities that could include the risks associated with
             lumbar puncture (e.g.papilledema, mass lesion, Chiari malformation).
