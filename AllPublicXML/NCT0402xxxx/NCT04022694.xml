  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverages are a significant contributor to adult and childhood obesity in
      Guatemala. Policies to place health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages are being
      pursued, but there is little empirical data on how such labels influence people. The primary
      aim of this study is to test the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) warning
      posters compared to control posters and change in SSBs purchased compared to baseline by
      adolescents shopping at school cafeterias in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The hypothesis is
      that posters with information warning people of the health harms associated with
      overconsuming SSBs and promoting low sugar beverages will be associated with greater
      reductions in SSB purchases compared to a control poster.

    <intervention_model_description>Three private schools will be enrolled in the study (two larger, one smaller) that have students between the ages of 12 and 18. There will be no posters displayed at any of the schools during the baseline period. The two larger schools will be randomized to either an SSB warning/non-SSB promoting poster or a calorie/control poster that will be implemented in the school cafeterias during a four-week intervention period. To increase the sample size for the intervention condition, the intervention will also be implemented at a smaller school. For the primary analysis, data from both schools that displayed the intervention posters will be combined, clustering on school.</intervention_model_description>
