  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare between the intra muscular quadratous lamborum and the Trans muscular quadratous
      lamborum in pediatric population under going abdominal surgeries regards to first request of
      rescue analgesia, degree of pain relief, effect on hemo dynamic stability and incidence of
      complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that an ultrasound guided quadratous lamborum block would
      prove successful peri-operative analgesia for abdominal surgeries in pediatric patients, and
      that Intra muscular quadratous lamborum is non inferior to Trans muscular blockade with the
      advantage of being safer (away from the peritoneum and retroperitoneal organs) and with the
      assumption that sarcolemmal layer in pediatrics should not resist the diffusion of the
      injectant from within the muscle out, to reach the inter fascial plane where the targeted
      nerves are found and cause an efficient blockade.

The identifiers will be attached to the opened envelopes and secured by dedicated person independent of randomization proceedings. Patients, parents and data analysts will be blinded to group assignments.
The groups:
group A → Trans muscular quadrous lamborum block (n=22)
group B → Intra muscular quadrous lamborum block (n=22)
group c → control (n=22) will receive conventional analgesia. Sample size Starting number of 22 patients for each group, Recalculation of the sample size will be carried out after studying 10 patients per group.
The alpha error is set at 0.05 and the study power is 0.95.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In group (Trans Muscular Quadratus Lumborum Block),will undergo ultrasound guided trans-muscular quadratus lamborum block as follows:
A 22 G echogenic needle will be inserted in plane from the posterior (medial) end of the probe and directed for the fascial plane between the Quadratus Lumborum and the Psoas Major muscles through the Quadratus Lumborum muscle. Once the needle is confirmed in correct location, 1 mL of saline will be injected after negative aspiration. Then 0.5 mL/Kg per side of bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected. The spread of the injectate should be observed to distribute within this plane. This technique will be repeated to the other side.</description>
