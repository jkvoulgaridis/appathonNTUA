  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised study will assess whether Parafricta bootees, when used in addition to normal
      standard care, can reduce the incidence of heel PUs in patients at very high risk of skin
      breakdown. The participant group will be hospital inpatients at high risk of PUs (Waterlow
      score of 20 or more) who are bedbound and do not have existing heel PUs. The participants
      will be randomised to an intervention arm using Parafricta plus standard care, or a control
      arm of standard care only. The primary outcome is incidence of heel PUs at day 3. Secondary
      outcomes are incidence of PUs at day 14, length of stay, severity of PUs, patient
      acceptability of device, cost-effectiveness.

    <description>Patients randomly allocated to standard care will be cared for on the appropriate mattress indicated for use in that participating centre according to local policy e.g. foam mattress or dynamic air mattress. Standard care may also include a mattress overlay or the use of a wedge or pillows to maintain the position of the participant, or pressure offloading boots on the foot if the need arises during the study period.</description>

    <description>Patients randomly allocated to Parafricta plus standard care will be cared for on the appropriate mattress as above and care may possibly include a mattress overlay or the use of a wedge or pillows. Participants will in addition be issued with Parafricta bootees (one pair and up to two spare pairs). The patient and clinical staff and the patient's carers will be instructed in the use of Parafricta bootees, which are intended to be worn throughout the day and night and removed only for normal daily washing or examination of the patient's feet. Either the slip-on bootees or the Velco-closure bootees will be selected for the participant at the judgment of the clinical ward nurses.</description>

    <description>Parafricta bootees are a medical device designed to eliminate skin damage due to friction and shear. The basis of Parafricta bootees is a low friction material and bi-layer construction to make the material of the bootee slide on itself when movement of the foot would otherwise bring friction and shear to bear on the skin.</description>
