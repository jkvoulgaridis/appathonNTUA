  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WestEd and its partners Efficacity and the Oregon Youth Authority (OYA), are conducting a
      randomized controlled trial of an innovative teen pregnancy prevention program, Healthy U,
      for youthful male offenders. This study involves male teenagers (age 14-19) at high risk for
      involvement in risky sexual behavior, including teen pregnancy. The innovative,
      non-curricular, technology-based intervention, Healthy U, is self-directed, low-cost, user
      friendly, and offers great promise in reaching incarcerated youth. The purpose of this study
      is to test this intervention on a population of young men incarcerated at the OYA who will
      soon be released into the community. The intervention is tailored to this population by
      updating the design, videos, and examples to best reflect the youth in the study, and OYA
      staff are being trained to facilitate the self-guided intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WestEd and its partners, Efficacity and the Oregon Youth Authority (OYA), were funded by the
      Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an
      innovative teen pregnancy prevention program, Healthy U (formally known as Virtual Student
      Health Center), for youthful male offenders to test the impact of this innovative,
      non-curricular, technology-based intervention, that is self-directed, low-cost, user
      friendly, and offers great promise in reaching incarcerated youth. Healthy U was designed to
      give adolescents and teens the tools they need to reduce their risk of unintended pregnancy
      and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, using a low-cost, transportable
      platform that is user-friendly for youth (and staff to oversee). In this project, we take the
      innovative Healthy U intervention and modify its implementation for juveniles in custody of a
      correctional facility.

      This study involved male teenagers (ages 14-19) at high risk for involvement in risky sexual
      behavior, including teen pregnancy. The findings from this study are intended to contribute
      to research on both teen pregnancy and crime prevention. Teen parents and their children are
      at greater risk for subsequent criminal offending, and the children of teen parents also have
      greater risk of child abuse and neglect victimization. The current knowledge base suggests
      that youth exposed to the juvenile justice system have sex more often with more partners at a
      younger age and without protection (Bryan, Rocheleau, Robbins, &amp; Hutchinson, 2005). This
      randomized study was designed to contribute to our understanding of what works with this
      population and to strengthen our knowledge base around developing and implementing
      technology-based interventions in a juvenile correctional environment.

    <measure>Sexual intercourse</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was based on four survey items. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the first item: &quot;Have you ever had sexual intercourse?&quot; were coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the second item: &quot;Have you been out of a close custody OYA facility any time in the past three months?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the third item: &quot;During the last 3 months, did you have sexual intercourse, even once?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;yes&quot; to the first three items and provided a valid response greater than zero to the fourth item: &quot;In the last 3 months (include only the time you were outside of a close custody OYA facility), how many TIMES did you have sexual inter-course?&quot; were coded as the value they entered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual intercourse without a condom</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was created by subtracting the sexual intercourse outcome from the following measure based on four items. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the first item: &quot;Have you ever had sexual intercourse?&quot; were coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the second item: &quot;Have you been out of a close custody OYA facility any time in the past three months?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the third item: &quot;During the last 3 months, did you have sexual intercourse, even once?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;yes&quot; to the first three items and provided a valid response greater than zero to the fourth item: &quot;In the last 3 months (include only the time you were outside of a close custody OYA facility), how many TIMES did you or your partner use a condom when you had sexual inter-course?&quot; were coded as the value they entered. Youth who responded &quot;none&quot; to the fourth item were coded as &quot;0&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual intercourse without any methods of birth control</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was based on four survey items. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the first item: &quot;Have you ever had sexual intercourse?&quot; were coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the second item: &quot;Have you been out of a close custody OYA facility any time in the past three months?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the third item: &quot;During the last 3 months, did you have sexual intercourse, even once?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;yes&quot; to the first three items and provided a valid response greater than zero to the fourth item: &quot;In the last 3 months (include only the time you were outside of a close custody OYA facility), how many times did you have sexual intercourse without you or your partner using any methods of birth control (that is, you didn't use a condom or any other type of birth control shown in the blue box above)?&quot; were coded as the value they entered. Youth who responded &quot;none&quot; to the fourth item were coded as &quot;0&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subsequent pregnancies of female partners</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was created by subtracting the number of pregnancies reported at baseline from the number of pregnancies reported at the 6-month follow-up. At both time points, the measure was based on three questions. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; to the first item: &quot;Have you ever had sexual intercourse?&quot; were coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;no&quot; or &quot;don't know&quot; to the second item: &quot;To the best of your knowledge, have you ever gotten someone pregnant, even if no child was born?&quot; were also coded as &quot;0&quot;. Youth who responded &quot;yes&quot; to the first two items and provided a valid response greater than zero to the third item: &quot;To the best of your knowledge, how many times have you gotten someone pregnant?&quot; were coded as the value they entered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptions of condoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was calculated as the average response based on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) for the following four items:
Condoms should always be used if a person your age has sexual intercourse.
Condoms are a hassle to use.
Condoms are important to make sex safer.
Using condoms means you don't trust your sexual partner. Youth needed to complete three of the four items to be included in the calculation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptions of sexual intercourse</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was calculated as the average response based on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) for the following five items:
Having sexual intercourse is a good thing for you to do at your age. (Reverse coded)
At your age right now, having sexual intercourse would create problems.
At your age right now, not having sexual intercourse is important for you to be safe and healthy.
At your age right now, it is okay for you to have sexual inter-course if you use birth control, like a condom. (Reverse coded)
It is against your values to have sexual intercourse before marriage.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Confidence in use of birth control</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was the response on a scale of 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (completely confident) for the following item: &quot;How confident are you that your partner used one of the methods of birth control shown in the blue box to the right the last time you had sexual intercourse?&quot;</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intentions to use condoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was the response on a scale of 1 (no, definitely not) to 4 (yes, definitely) based on the following item: &quot;If you were to have sexual intercourse in the next year, do you intend to use a condom?&quot;</description>

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge about condoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome was calculated as the average response based on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 3 (a lot) for the following three items:
If a condom is used correctly, how much can it decrease the risk of…
Pregnancy?
Getting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS?
Getting chlamydia and gonorrhea? Responses of &quot;don't know&quot;, which represented less than 6% of the data, were treated as missing. Youth needed to complete two of the three items to be included in the calculation.</description>

    <description>Healthy U is a self-administered intervention implemented through a tablet app with interactive learning experiences, including videos, digital games, quizzes, and role-plays. Healthy U takes youth 3-4 hours to complete. The goals of Healthy U are to: 1) Increase male youth's perception of vulnerability to unplanned fatherhood, STDs and HIV; 2) Increase male youth's self-efficacy for negotiating condom use with their partners; 3) Increase male youth's self-efficacy for using condoms correctly and consistently every time they have sex; and 4) Increase male youth's engagement with goals and dreams for their future.</description>

    <description>There are seven modules in Healthy U: Puberty, Birth Control, Teen Pregnancy, HIV, STDs, Healthy Relationships, and Condom Negotiation. Each module has six sections: Introduction and Review, Narrative Teen Portrait, Information Film, Activity/Game, Dramatic Film, and Imagination Challenge. The Introduction and Review has videos lasting 1-2 minutes where the Healthy U &quot;host&quot; introduces each module. In the Narrative Teen Portrait for each module, a different teen discusses their experience with the topic for 1-3 minutes. The Information Film lasts 5-18 minutes per module and provides factual information. For each module, the Activity/Game includes multiple choice, true/false, or other games. The Dramatic Film lasts 5-17 minutes for each module and shows a fictional account of a teen experiencing the topic. Finally, the Imagination Challenge asks the youth to imagine a scenario, such as going to a health clinic to obtain free condoms.</description>
