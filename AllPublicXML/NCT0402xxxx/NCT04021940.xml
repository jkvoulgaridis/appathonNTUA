  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder and a leading cause of
      infertility in women of reproductive age affecting up to 20% of them. Laparoscopic ovarian
      drilling (LOD) is considered a second-line treatment of infertile patients with clomiphene
      citrate-resistant (CCR) PCOS i.e. those who did not ovulate in response to CC doses of up to
      150 mg for at least three consecutive cycles. The advantage of LOD is the induction of
      unifollicular ovulation without the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or high-order
      multiple pregnancies.

      The common practice of LOD was to drill both ovaries i.e. bilateral (BLOD) with a fixed dose
      of 600 Joules per each ovary (1200 Joules in both) delivered through four punctures, each for
      4 s and using 40 W. However, its main adverse effect is diminished ovary reserve due to
      tissue damage (2). In 1994, Balen and Jacobs reported the effectiveness of fixed-dose
      unilateral LOD (ULOD) in the management of those women. Subsequently, several randomized
      trials demonstrated its efficacy with comparable ovulation and pregnancy rates to BLOD.

      Recently, a new concept called&quot;dose-adjusted&quot; ULOD was proposed. It means to tailor the
      energy applied to one ovary, according to its preoperative volume using 60 J/ cm3. When
      compared with the fixed-dose BLOD among 96 infertile women with CCR- PCOS, a significantly
      higher ovulation rate during the first postoperative menstrual cycle was in favor of the ULOD
      group (73 vs. 49%). Meanwhile, a comparable ovulation rate over the 6-month period was found
      (82 vs. 64%) (6). In addition, both groups experienced a reduction in serum anti-mullerian
      hormone (AMH) level after LOD which was significantly more in the BLOD group in the first and
      the 6-month follow-up periods. However, another RCT (n=108 CCR- PCOS patients) reported a
      comparable ovulation and pregnancy rates at 3-month follow-up period (65.4 vs. 77.3% and 15.4
      vs. 26.4%, in ULOD and BLOD respectively) with a reduction in the effectiveness of
      dose-adjusted ULOD after 6 months. A highly significant difference between ULOD and BLOD
      groups with regard to the AMH level at 3- and 6-month was also reported. Thereby, the
      efficacy of dose-adjusted ULOD in improving fertility outcomes in infertile women with CCR-
      PCOS as well as its effect on ovarian reserve warrants more investigation.
