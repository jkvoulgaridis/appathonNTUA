  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High volume drinking by young adults has proven resistant to long term change, so new
      approaches are needed. Given strong associations between alcohol-related attitudes and
      drinking behavior, the investigators adapt a theory-based attitude change strategy for use in
      alcohol prevention. This research tests the impact of a brief counter attitudinal advocacy
      activity on subsequent drinking and negative consequences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The persistence of risky drinking among young adults in college calls for continued efforts
      to prevent harms related to alcohol. Current prevention interventions have achieved some
      success, but rely on a single mechanism of change: correcting exaggerated drinking norms. The
      investigators propose to test a novel prevention strategy targeting another mechanism of
      change: creating attitude-behavior dissonance. To date, changing alcohol-related attitudes
      and the resulting attitude-behavior discrepancy has been underutilized as a behavior change
      strategy for alcohol abuse prevention. Informed by an extensive literature showing strong and
      consistent associations between alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior, the investigators
      adapted a brief counter-attitudinal advocacy (CAA) manipulation to the alcohol prevention
      context.

    <description>The Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (BYAACQ) (Kahler et al., 2005) is a 24-item self-administered checklist of problems related to drinking; responses are dichotomous (yes/no) and refer to the past month which was collected at baseline and 5-months. The BYAACQ demonstrates strong psychometric properties and is free of gender bias (Kahler et al., 2005).</description>
