  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 16 weeks 3-weekly supervised and adapted physical exercise program will be applied to
      breast cancer survivors in surveillance and, in estrogen receptor positive cases, under
      hormonotherapy. The program will be applied in group classes of 20 participants, in the
      facilities of one local gymnasium, by fitness instructors included in the investigation team.
      Investigators will evaluate the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), physical activity,
      cardiopulmonary fitness, upper limb strength and lower limb functionality. The investigators
      also aim to evaluate the safety of the program and oncological outcomes such as symptoms
      related to disease and its treatment and, also, overall survival and disease free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a two-arm prospective non randomized trial that will test the HRQoL
      effect of a 16 weeks 3-weekly supervised and adapted physical exercise program that combines
      muscle strength and aerobic training with progressive intensity. The benefits of physical
      exercise programs in breast cancer survivors is well known. However, the studied programs
      usually are not generalizable because of needs of specialized exercise professionals and
      materials. The investigators aim to evaluate if it is possible to obtain the same benefits in
      HRQoL, physical activity, cardiopulmonary fitness, upper limb strength and lower limb
      functionality when the program is applied in group classes by trained fitness instructors
      with exercise strategies based in limited material. Maximum participants of each group class
      is 20. Each participant will pass through a 16 weeks control phase, during which should
      maintain the usual physical activity and, then, through a 16 weeks study phase, during which
      undergoes the physical exercise program. In each phase, the participants will be serially
      evaluated. During the 32 weeks, each participant will pass through 5 evaluation moments: at
      baseline, at 8 weeks, at 16 weeks before beginning the study phase, at 8 weeks of physical
      exercise and 16 weeks of physical exercise at the end of the program. After, investigators
      aim to evaluate each participant at 3, 6 and 12 months ant, then, yearly.

    <description>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30). This is a patient-reported questionnaire composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100.A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
