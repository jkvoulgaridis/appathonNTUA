  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test a new AAC-BCI device comparing gel and dry electrode
      headgear used for communication while providing clinical care. Innovative resources will be
      employed to support the standard of care without considering limitations based on service
      billing codes. Clinical services will include AAC assessment, AAC-BCI device and treatment to
      individuals with minimal movement due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain stem
      strokes, severe cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their family support person.
      This is a descriptive study designed to measure and monitor the communication performance of
      individuals using the AAC-BCI, any other AAC strategies, their user satisfaction and
      perceptions of communication effectiveness, and the satisfaction of the family support
      persons.

      This clinical trial follows a descriptive study design collecting data to measure and monitor
      variables related to the standard of care in providing speech language pathology augmentative
      and alternative communication clinical (AAC) assessment and treatment. The study tracks
      participants through the AAC, speech generating device trial and AAC-BCI trial processes. In
      addition this study measures and monitors the communication performance of individuals using
      the AAC-BCI and any other AAC strategies for treatment in the home. Data on communication
      performance, user satisfaction, and perceptions of communication effectiveness are gathered
      over monthly visits along with the satisfaction and perceptions of communication
      effectiveness by the family support persons.

    <description>At the initial evaluation the participants will review the full range of AAC options and speech generating devices (SGDs) and complete a speech and language evaluation. The second evaluation date will involve a trial of SGDs matched to the participant's assessment results. The third visit is the trial of an AAC system with BCI access. Should the dry electrode headgear for BCI access prove ineffective, then the gel electrode cap will be offered to the participant for trial. At the end of the third visit, the evaluation results will be discussed with participant and family, and they will be asked to select the preferred SGD.</description>

    <description>Participants receive training on the selected SGD followed by monthly treatment sessions from the SLP who monitors performance. In some cases the participants' SGD will be an AAC system with BCI access. In this case training will also include an identified system support person. Use of the SGD is monitored on a monthly basis through home visits and/or tele-practice sessions, when requested. Technical support for the SGD is provided on an as needed basis or when requested by the participant or support person.</description>
