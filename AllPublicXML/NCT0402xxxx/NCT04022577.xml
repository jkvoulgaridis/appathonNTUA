      patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

    <textblock>
      A single-blind, randomized controlled trial with a repeated-measures, two parallel groups
      design will be conducted for 120 participants with schizophrenia spectrum in regional
      hospital in northern Taiwan. After baseline data collection finished, the blocked
      randomization will be employed to assign participants to two groups. The experimental group
      will participate in a eight session course of Adherence Therapy. The control group received
      routine care. The data will be collected for three times: before and after the intervention
      and 6 months after the intervention ends. A structured Questionnaire will use to collect data
      on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale, Schedule for the Assessment of Insight,
      Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale, Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire and
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Data analysis will employ IBM SPSS 20.0 with
      Generalized estimating equations approach to examine effects of Adherence Therapy and routine
      care on medication adherence.

    <time_frame>for two study groups at baseline(T0) and 3-month follow-up (T1) and 6-month follow-up(T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The MARS was developed by Thompson, Kulkarni, &amp; Sergejew(2000) by combining the Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire and the Drug Attitude Inventory. It evaluates the adherence behavior and attitude of the patient within the previous week. There are 10 close-ended questions (yes/no answers) in the questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Schedule for the Assessment of Insight, SAI</measure>
    <time_frame>for two study groups at baseline(T0) and 3-month follow-up (T1) and 6-month follow-up(T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Schedule of Assessment of Insight (SAI) measures multiple dimensions of insight, including compliance with treatment, recognition of illness, re-labeling of psychotic phenomena, and awareness of changes in mental functioning and psychosocial consequences of the illness.The maximum score of the SAI is 14, with higher SAI scores indicating greater insight. The Cronbach alpha for the SAI was 0.96, and inter-rater reliability (r) between the two research psychiatrists was .92 in the present study.</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS</measure>
    <time_frame>for two study groups at baseline(T0) and 3-month follow-up (T1) and 6-month follow-up(T2).</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assessed the severity of psychotic symptoms in terms of three subscales, including positive symptoms (hallucinations,delusional beliefs, and thougThe 30-item 7point Likert scale (from 1-'Absent' to 7-'Extremely').</description>

    <measure>Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire, SAIQ</measure>
    <time_frame>for two study groups at baseline(T0) and 3-month follow-up (T1) and 6-month follow-up(T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Appraisal of Illness Questionnaire (SAIQ) was used to assess patients' insight into their illness.The need for treatment and presence/outcome of illness subscales of SAIQ have been used as brief screening instruments for schizophrenic patients who may be at risk for treatment noncompliance. Lower SAIQ subscale scores indicate reduced awareness of the psychiatric illness. This scale is a self reporting instrument composed of 17 items in which participants are asked to rate the extent to which they agreed with each statement by using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (ie, &quot;do not agree at all&quot;) to 3 (ie, &quot;agree completely&quot;).
The internal consistency of the scale was 0.867, and the retest reliability was 0.82.</description>
