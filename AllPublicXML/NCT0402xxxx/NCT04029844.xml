      The Colibri Heart Valve clinical investigation (&quot;COL-01&quot;) is a prospective, multicenter,
      single arm and controlled CE marking clinical investigation compared to recent historical
      results. This study will be conducted in about 10 European sites. The study will evaluate the
      safety and performance of the Colibri Transcatheter Aortic Heart Valve System for the
      treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis via transfemoral access in high surgical risk
      patients.

      60 subjects suffering from symptomatic severe aortic tricuspid valve stenosis and who are at
      high surgical risk (logistic EuroSCORE I &gt; 20% or other risk factors not included in this
      score such as frailty, porcelain aorta, sequelae of chest radiation or logistic EuroSCORE I &lt;
      20% but considered at high risk by local Heart Team evaluation) will be enrolled in this
      clinical investigation.

      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the all-cause mortality
      at 30 days post implantation. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and
      performance of the investigational device at 30 days, 6 and 12 months, and 2, 3, 4, 5 years
      post implantation.
