      The study will test the effectiveness of a smartphone-based behavior modification program

      controlled trial in 432 low-income women enrolled in the Louisiana Women, Infants, and
      Children program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-site randomized controlled trial, testing the effectiveness of the
      smartphone-based behavior modification program in pregnant women within the Louisiana Women,
      Infants, and Children program. Equal number of participants will be randomized to either the
      intervention or the control. Although the intervention itself lasts 24 weeks (only during
      pregnancy), women will be enrolled in this study for approximately 18 months, from the
      10-16th week of pregnancy until 12 month postpartum follow-up. Study outcomes will be
      assessed at three visits during pregnancy (early, mid, and late,) and three visits postpartum
      (1, 6, and 12 months).
