  <brief_summary>

      Studying in a two RCT the changes induced by early HABIT-ILE in functional, neuroplastic and
      biomechanical assessment in children with unilateral and bilateral CP.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of two weeks of early HABIT-ILE on bimanual
      performance in pre-school children with unilateral CP and on gross motor function in those
      with bilateral CP, compared with two weeks of usual motor activity including usual
      rehabilitation (control group). We will assess further changes in unilateral performance
      tests, daily life activities questionnaires and executive function tests. Neuroplastic
      changes will be assessed using brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and
      biomechanical changes will be assessed by using optoelectronic motion capture system with
      EMG, to determine the effect of HABIT-ILE on movement pattern and quality.
