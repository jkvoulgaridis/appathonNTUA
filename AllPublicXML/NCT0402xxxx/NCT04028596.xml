    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, postictal phenomena (i.e., headache, delirium) will be investigated
      after administration of acetaminophen and nimodipine in depressed patients receiving
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Postictal phenomena are thought to result from decreased
      cerebral blood flow and decreased oxygen concentration in the brain. It is expected that
      acetaminophen and nimodipine will reduce these postictal phenomena, compared to no treatment,
      because they target these mechanisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postictal phenomena, such as sensory, motor or memory deficits, headache, delirium, and
      psychosis, are common manifestations after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) induced seizures.
      Also, postictal phenomena add to the burden of seizures in patients with epilepsy. The
      pathophysiology of these phenomena is poorly understood and effective treatments are not
      available (Fisher RS, 2000; Krauss &amp; Theodore, 2010). Recently, seizure-induced postictal
      vasoconstriction with cerebral hypoperfusion was observed in experimentally induced seizures
      in rats. Treatment with acetaminophen or calcium antagonists decreased hypoperfusion and
      postictal phenomena (Farrell, 2016, 2017).

      The objective of this research is to study the effect of acetaminophen and nimodipine to
      reduce postictal phenomena after ECT induced seizures.

      A prospective, three conditions crossover trial will be conducted, with randomized condition
      allocation, open-label treatment, and blinded end-point evaluation (PROBE design; Hansson,
      Hedner, &amp; Dahlof, 1992).

      Thirty-three adult (age &gt;17 years) patients referred to treatment with ECT for a depressive
      episode will be included to achieve a statistical power of .80. This will be feasible in one
      year.

      A single dose of nimodipine (60 mg) or acetaminophen (1000 mg) or no additional treatment
      will be given prior to a maximum of 12 ECT-sessions per patient. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to predefined treatment sequences. EEG and MRI measures will serve as main outcome
      measures, as well as psychometric tests.

      Data will be stored on two separate hard disks, one including patient sensitive information
      for identification, the other with anonymized data only (for the sponsor).

      Patients will be recruited by doctors at Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem. A mixed model with
      repeated measurements analysis will be conducted for the primary outcome measures.

    <time_frame>immediately after each ECT session, up to 12 times per patient (across 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Five questions regarding reorientation will be asked in an interval of 5 minutes after electroconvulsive shock therapy has ended. If the patient can answer 4 out of the 5 questions correctly, this is determined as the final score (in minutes). The scale ranges from 5 to 100 minutes. These scores indicate the time frame a patient needs until he/she is fully conscious and reoriented. Higher values indicate that a patient needs more time to regain reorientation.</description>
