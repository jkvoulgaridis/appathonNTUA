          -  9. Unable to fast for the 6 hours prior to Investigational Product administration;

          -  10. Clinically significant (as judged by the Investigator) presence of acute illness
             (e.g. gastrointestinal illness, infection such as influenza, upper respiratory tract
             infection) at admission to the clinical study unit;

          -  11. Anticipated need for surgery or hospitalization during the study;

          -  12. Anatomical abnormality that would potentially interfere with airway management
