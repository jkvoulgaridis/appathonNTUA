  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing the speed of orthodontic treatment is an emerging clinical problem and therefore
      the evaluation of the effects of photobiomodulation applications and methods on orthodontic
      tooth movement is considered as an important factor.

      When literature studies are examined, different studies have been performed on Laser and LED
      applications, however, the lack of a study that evaluates and compares the effectiveness of
      these methods in terms of clinical and biochemical parameters.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of laser and LED applications on tooth
      movement speed and to investigate the effects of these applications on the gingival fluid
      IL-8, OPG, RANKL. Total of 24 patients with maxillary first-premolar extraction orthodontic
      treatment will be included in this study, and this study will consist of 3 groups, Laser, LED
      and placebo group. The laser will be applied on days 0,3,7,14,21,28,35, take impression of
      teeth and gingival fluid samples will be collected in these days.

      LED group will be given 10 minutes LED for 30 days, taken impression and DOS samples will be
      collected on specified days. In the placebo group, the non-active pulse laser light will be
      kept in the teeth and the patients will not know which group in they are. Thus, the
      psychological dimension of the applications will be eliminated. Sampling will be done for the
      placebo group on the days determined.

      The investigator's project proposal consists of a total of 5 work packages; Determination of
      patient groups in the 1st stage and obtaining consent forms, 2nd stage Photobiomodulation
      applications (laser, LED, placebo application), 3rd stage orthodontic measurement and
      evaluation of these measurements 3D environment, taking gingival fluid samples in the 4th
      stage and evaluating them biochemically. In the 5th stage, statistical analysis and
      evaluation of the results will be done.

      The data will be evaluated with SPSS 21.0.In this study, it is tried to reduce the time spent
      in the orthodontic treatment to close the extraction area. In this way, it will contribute to
      economy and time saving in terms of all orthodontic treatment physicians and physicians. It
      will illuminate the application of LED device which is more advantageous in terms of cost and
      space gain in clinical practice of physicians.
