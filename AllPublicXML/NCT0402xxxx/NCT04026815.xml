  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PolSenior2 survey is aimed to characterise health status of old and very-old adults in
      Poland.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the goals is assessing the prevalence and control of age-related diseases and of the
      &quot;geriatric giants&quot; (immobility, instability, incontinence, sensory deficiency, cognition and
      mood disorders) which lead to frailty, disability and dependence. Monitoring of health
      status, health behaviors and identifying socio-economic factors favoring successful aging
      will be significant. As the polypragmasy and adverse drug reactions remain a significant
      issue in the geriatric care, pharmacotherapy and medical adherence will also be examined.

      The additional purpose of the study is to evaluate the utilization and access to health care
      and social services in respect to needs for assistance and long-term care, as well as the
      level and different forms of these needs.

      The project is planned as a cross-sectional survey of representative sample of 6000 people
      aged 60 years and over. The study protocol consists of questionnaires (medical,
      socio-economic, dietary), comprehensive geriatric assessment, anthropometric and blood
      pressure measurements and laboratory tests. The data are collected by well-trained nurses
      during three visits at respondents homes.

    <measure>Functional status as assessed by Vulnerable Elders Survey-13</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) is a simple function-based tool for screening community-dwelling populations to identify older persons at risk for health deterioration. The VES-13 considers age, self-related health, limitation in physical function, and functional disabilities. The total possible score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating increased disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional status as assessed by Instrumental Activity of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL-Lawton) instrument. IADL evaluates independent living skills. Each activity has specific level of participation that can be selected. Scores range from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 points (high function, independent).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional status as assessed by Activity of Daily Living Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using the Activity of Daily Living (ADL-Katz Index) instrument. ADL evaluates functional status as a measurement of the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. Each activity is rated as being completed independently or not. Scores range is 0-6 points, higher score is better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood deterioration incidence</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a 15-item self-report assessment designed specifically to identify symptoms of depression in the elderly. Participants are asked to respond by answering yes or no in reference to how they felt over the past 2 weeks. The score 5 and more suggests the suspicion of depression, higher scores indicate more severe depressive syndrome. The final diagnosis of depression needs clinical assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive functions as assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) investigates specific cognitive functions. Scale range: 0-30. The score 23 and below indicates significant deterioration of cognitive functions and dementia. Score between 24-27 indicates mild cognitive impairment. Normal score ranges between 28-30.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive functions as assessed by Clock Drawing Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Clock Drawing Test is a test used for the assessment of cognitive impairment based on sketches of a clock completed by a patient. The assessment is based on identifying abnormalities in the drawings, which may include poor number positioning, omission of numbers, incorrect sequencing, missing clock hands and the presence of irrelevant writing. According to Sunderland the score is: 0-10. Higher score indicates normal cognitive functions.</description>

    <measure>Nutritional status assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment questionnaire (MNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MNA is a validated nutrition screening and assessment tool that can identify geriatric patients age 65 and above who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. The Screening score(max. 14 points) is 12-14 points indicates &quot;Normal nutritional status&quot;, 8-11 points indicates &quot;At risk of malnutrition&quot;, 0-7 points indicates &quot;Malnourished&quot;. For the full assessment there are proposed scores: 24 pts and more &quot;Normal nutritional status&quot;; 23,5-17 &quot;At risk of malnutrition&quot;; below 17 - malnourished&quot;</description>
