  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot sequential multiple assignment trial (SMART) to understand the optimal timing
      to assess response to our smoking cessation text message intervention and to measure how
      adding medications alone compares to adding medications and telephone coaching for those who
      continue to smoke. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a SMART of a proactively
      offered text message intervention for smokers in primary care that compares early (4 weeks)
      versus late (8 weeks) assessment of treatment response and the addition of nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT) alone or with telephone coaching for non-responders.

    <description>Patients are assessed for response to brief telephone advice plus a tailored text message program at 4 weeks post-randomization. Response is based on self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence. Non-responders are randomized to 4 weeks of mailed nicotine patches and/or lozenges (NRT) or 4 weeks of mailed NRT plus proactive telephone coaching.</description>

    <description>Patients who report continued smoking at Early or Late assessment (depending on random assignment) will be offered a 4 week supply of patches and/or lozenges dosed according to package instructions (patches dosed according to cigarettes smoked per day and lozenges dosed according to time to first cigarette).</description>

    <intervention_name>Proactive telephone coaching</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients who report continued smoking at Early (4-week) or Late (8-week) assessment of response will be randomized to receive proactive telephone coaching or not. Proactive coaching will consist of an attempt to reach the patient by telephone in order to review quit activities, provide information about locally available pharmacologic and behavioral treatment options and information sharing with patient's primary care provider. The coach is trained in core Tobacco Treatment Specialist activities.</description>
