  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide. Population-based
      screening programs for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer have been introduced as part
      of cancer control in many high-income countries. Population-based cancer screening programs
      do not exist in most low- and middle-income countries. There are some studies that report the
      awareness of colorectal cancer in Turkey.

      Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in both men and women. According to
      World Health Organization data, in 2012, 694 thousand people were thought to be due to
      colorectal cancer and this number increased to 862 thousand people in 2018. Especially in
      most low- and middle-income countries where cancers are mainly detected through
      very-late-stage symptoms and many are not reported. Recent researches may lead to new
      approaches to early detection and treatment using improved awareness of the symptomatic
      disease and population-based screening of asymptomatic people. The increasing of colorectal
      cancer awareness could help early detection of colorectal cancers. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to determine the level of awareness of colorectal cancer and knowledge
      about colorectal cancer screenings in patients who applied to general surgery outpatients
      clinic where a colorectal cancer diagnosis was most frequently diagnosed.
