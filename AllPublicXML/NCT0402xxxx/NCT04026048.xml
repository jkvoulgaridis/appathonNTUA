  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will answer the question of whether treating insomnia using Cognitive
      Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) can improve perceived cognitive impairment (PCI) in
      cancer survivors compared to a waitlist control group. The investigators will recruit 162
      people with insomnia and cognitive complaints who have completed cancer treatment at least 12
      months prior to the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of immediate treatment with
      CBT-I compared to a delayed treatment group with 162 cancer survivors who have completed
      primary treatment at least 12 months prior and report PCI and insomnia. Patients who are
      randomized to the immediate treatment group will receive 7 individual sessions of CBT-I over
      the course of 8 weeks, after which the delayed treatment group will receive the intervention.
      Both groups will complete follow up assessments three and six months after completing
      treatment. PCI will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive
      Function (FACT-Cog) as the primary outcome. In addition to self-report measures, sleep will
      be assessed using actigraphy, an objective non- invasive measure of sleep. To provide an
      objective assessment of cognition, the investigators have included the neurocognitive
      measures recommended by the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force. Other measures
      will include fatigue, anxiety, depression, and work productivity.

      The investigators hypothesize that the online CBT-I group will report significantly greater
      improvements in perceived cognitive function compared to the waitlist control immediately
      post-treatment (primary endpoint). The investigators also hypothesize that these improvements
      will be maintained up at 6-months follow up (secondary endpoint).

    <measure>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) version 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Cog will be used as the measure of perceived cognitive impairment. It is a 37-item questionnaire with four cognitive subscales: perceived cognitive impairments, impact on quality of life, comments from others, and perceived cognitive abilities. Responses range from 0, ''never,'' to 4, ''several times a day,'' in the previous 7 days. The total score for the FACT-Cog can range from 0 to 148 points, with a higher score indicative of better self-reported cognitive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Sleep efficiency measured by Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy measures sleep efficiency based on motor activity. Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time spent asleep while in bed. It is calculated by dividing the amount of time spent asleep (in minutes) by the total amount of time in bed (in minutes). The unit of measure is a percentage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and Depression will be measured using the HADS, which is a 14-item, self-rated instrument for anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) symptoms in the past week and has been extensively used in people with cancer. Scores range from 0-21 with below 7 indicating a non-case and the higher the score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured using the MFSI-SF, which is a 30 item self-report measure comprised of five subscales (general, emotional, physical, mental, vigor) and a total fatigue score. Each subscale score ranges from 0 to 24. The Total MSFI-SF score is calculated by adding the general, physical, emotional and mental subscale scores and subtracting vigor subscale score. Total MFSI-SF score ranges from −24 to 96 with a higher score indicating higher levels of cancer-related fatigue experienced by the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R is a brief assessment of verbal learning and memory (immediate recall, delayed recall, delayed recognition). When scoring the HVLT-R, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score; the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score; the retention (%) score is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. These scores are then converted to an age-based T score.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Digit Span</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Span test is a subtest of both the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). Part a of digit span (the forward span) captures attention efficiency and capacity, and part b (the backward span) is an executive task dependent on working memory. The Digit Span subtest will be scored as one summary value. The unit of measure is the total recall.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A is composed of 75 items within nine non-overlapping theoretically and empirically derived clinical scales. It has 2 broad indexes (Behavioural Regulation and Metacognition), an overall summary score, and three validity scales (Negativity, Inconsistency, and Infrequency). T scores (M = 50, SD = 10) (transformations of the raw scale scores) are used to interpret the individual's level of executive functioning. Traditionally, T scores at or above 65 are considered clinically significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI questionnaire was developed for the purpose of collecting productivity loss data within clinical trials and is suitable for direct translation into a monetary figure. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
