    <textblock>
      This research study is is studying cytokine induced memory-like natural killer (CIML NK)
      cells plus IL-2 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN.

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved CIML NK Cell Infusion as a
      treatment for relapsed disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapse of AML, MDS or MPN (CMML or
             myelofibrosis or MDS/MPN with ≥5% blasts in the marrow).

          -  Relapse at ≥2 months after first related donor haploidentical stem cell
             transplantation.

          -  Available original donor (same donor as used for the initial stem cell transplant)
             that is willing and eligible for non-mobilized collection.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Recipient donor T cell chimerism ≥20% within the 4 weeks prior to cell infusion.

          -  Patient with ≤50% bone marrow involvement within 4 weeks prior to cell infusion.

          -  No systemic corticosteroid therapy for GVHD (≤ 5mg of prednisone or equivalent dose of
             systemic steroids for non-GVHD, non-autoimmune indications for at at least 4 weeks
             prior to cell infusion).

          -  No other systemic medications/treatments (e.g. ECP) for GVHD for at least 4 weeks
             prior to cell infusion.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Adequate organ function as defined below:

               -  Total bilirubin: ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except
                  Gilbert's or disease-related hemolysis, then &lt; 3 x ULN)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT): ≤3 x institutional ULN

               -  creatinine clearance: ≤1.5 x institutional ULN

               -  O2 saturation: ≥90% on room air

               -  LVEF &gt;40%

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential only.

          -  The effects of CIML NK cells and IL-2 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after the last IL-2 dose administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Extramedullary relapse involving immuno-privileged sites (e.g. CNS, testes, eyes).
             Other sites of extramedullary relapse (e.g. leukemia cutis, granulocytic sarcoma) are
             acceptable.

          -  Participants who have had anti-tumor chemotherapy or other investigational agents
             within 4 weeks prior to cell infusion (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), or
             immunotherapy within 8 weeks prior, or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks prior. Use of hydroxyurea to
             control counts within 4 weeks prior to cell infusion is permitted.

          -  Prior history of treatment with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 pathway therapy, or CD137
             agonist therapy for post-transplant relapse.

          -  Prior history of Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI).

          -  Prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) acute GVHD, or ongoing active GVHD requiring
             systemic treatment.

          -  Organ transplant (allograft) recipient.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to IL-2 or other agents used in study.

          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients
             with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]) and motor neuropathy considered of
             autoimmune origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis). Patients with
             Hashimoto's thyroiditis are eligible to go on study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the unknown teratogenic risk of
             CIML NK cells and IL-2 and with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects
             by Flu/Cy chemotherapy regimen. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CIML NK
             cells and IL-2, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this
             study.

          -  HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with anti-retroviral agents used in this study. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C are ineligible as they are at
             high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after HSCT
