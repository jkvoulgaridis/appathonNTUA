      The aim is to study bone and soft tissue response to zirconia immediate implants.Volumetric
      changes will be measured before tooth extraction and after final crow placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone remodeling around immediate implants is a reality in clinical and literature arena. much
      is known about titanium implants but little in zirconia implants

      In patients that require a tooth extraction anywhere in the oral cavity except 3rd molars are
      candidates fo the study. Once clinical conditions are establish and medical clearance is ok,
      the decision for an immediate implant is taken.

      Patient will undergo for an intraoral Scanner (IOS, Trios 3Shape) to get an STL file of the
      previous situation.

      On the day of surgery an atraumatically tooth extraction is performed (without rasing a flap)
      and a Zirconia implant is inserted on the alveolar socket.

      The jumping gap (distance from crystal bone to implant body will be filled with a zenograft
      type of biomaterial) no sutures or membrane will be used.

      A provisional crown or an individualized healing abutment will be placed. After 3 month
      healing an IOS will be made for crown fabrication and a second STL file generated.

      After 15 days final crown will be placed, and 3 month after a 3rd IOS made to get the 3rd and
      final STL file.

      An STL software will then make the correlation between the volume behavior in those 3 stages.

      The control group, patients go for tooth extraction but no immediate implant and undergo with
      a classic protocol for implant placement. In this case the STL files are taken pre-operatory,
      before implant placement 3 month after tooth extraction, 2 month after implant placement (at
      final impression level), and 3 month after crown placement.

    <description>Group Formation : patients that require a tooth extraction and have the following clinical indications to be enrolled in an immediate implant.
No Active Infection
No loss of buccal plate
ASA 1 or ASA 2 Patient
Extraction of the tooth will be performed and in the same clinical act, a zirconia dental implant will be placed toghether with a provisional or an individualized customs healing abutment. The jumping gap will be filled with a xenograft biomaterial.
Final Zirconia Crown delivered 3 month after healing.
3 STL files will be generated - Before extraction, at Final impression level 3 month after implant placement, at 3 month after final prosthesis insertion
Measure 1,2 and 3 will be at the gingival margin(measure 1), at 2mm (measure 2) and 4 mm (measure 3) apical to gingival margin. Both palatal and buccal references are joined by a line that gives a distance.Difference on the dimensions of each line with different time of evaluation represent ridge loss.</description>
