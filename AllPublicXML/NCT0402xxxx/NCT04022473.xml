  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare in healthy subjects, the GI tolerability of
      bioequivalent doses of Bafiertam™(monomethyl fumarate) and its pro-drug Tecfidera® (dimethyl
      fumarate).

      Secondary objective of this study is to compare the safety and tolerability of Bafiertam™ and
      Tecfidera® when administered orally following bioequivalent dose regimens in healthy
      subjects.

    <textblock>
      Subjects randomized (1:1) to either Bafiertam (monomethyl fumarate) or Tecfidera (dimethyl
      fumarate) will enter a double-blind titration period where they will receive either Bafiertam
      95 mg twice daily (BID) or Tecfidera 120 mg BID for 7 days. Following the titration period,
      they will enter a maintenance period in which they will receive Bafiertam 190 mg BID or
      Tecfidera 240 mg BID for 4 weeks.

    <measure>Comparison of the Modified Overall Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale (MOGISS) composite score</measure>

    <description>The MOGISS assesses global GI events (defined as one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, diarrhea, upper abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, bloating, and flatulence) and their effect on the patient during the 24 hours before each morning dose. The events items are rated on a 10-point numerical rating scale, where 0 = no events, 1 to 3 = mild events, 4 to 6 = moderate events, 7 to 9 = severe events, and 10 = extreme events. The MOGISS Total (sum of 8 scores) range is 0 (no symptoms) to 80 (worst possible symptoms) and the MOGISS Composite (average of 8 scores) range is 0 (no symptoms) - 10 (worst possible symptoms).</description>
