  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Stage 1 is to evaluate the safety of nivolumab consolidation after
      R-MPV induction chemotherapy in older subjects with previously untreated PCNSL in terms of a
      tolerated dose (based on dose-limiting toxicities) for the expansion phase of the study
      (Stage 2). The primary objective of Stage 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab
      consolidation after R-MPV induction chemotherapy in terms of the 2-year progression-free
      survival rate.

      This is a 2-stage phase 1B study of R-MPV (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine,
      vincristine) induction chemotherapy followed by nivolumab consolidation in older (≥ 65 years
      old) patients with previously untreated primary CNS lymphoma. Stage 1 is designed to evaluate
      the safety of nivolumab consolidation after R-MPV induction chemotherapy. We plan to use 3+3
      design and start at the FDA approved single agent dose of nivolumab 480 mg intravenously
      every 4 weeks. Stage 2 is designed to evaluate the safety as well as efficacy of nivolumab
      consolidation after R-MPV induction chemotherapy in an expansion cohort.

             of HBsAg) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable. If enrolled, subjects must be
             willing to undergo monthly HBV DNA testing.
