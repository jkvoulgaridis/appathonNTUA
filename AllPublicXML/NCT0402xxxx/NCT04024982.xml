      This study aims to find out the best sequence of teaching and learning events (i.e. first
      lecture and then simulated training or first simulated training and then lecture) in the
      acquisition of knowledge on Transoesophageal Echocardiography among trainee and specialist
      anaesthesiologists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basic Transoesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is an essential skill in the armamentarium of
      an anaesthesiologist. Currently, majority of the TEE teaching is being done in the form of
      didactic lectures with only a few teaching centres offering simulation. TEE skill acquisition
      includes both technical and cognitive skills. Most of the studies done in TEE teaching have
      concluded that TEE simulation is an essential part of TEE skill training. The study team
      wanted to find out what is the best sequence of teaching to achieve the maximum skill
      acquisition in TEE.

      In National University Hospital, Singapore, the Cardiac subdivision of anaesthesia
      specialists are accredited in TEE (American or European exams) and perform independent
      decision making in cardiac surgical theatres while the surgery is on-goingto facilitate
      dynamic decision making such as adequacy of valve repair, global LV function and emerging
      complications if any. The study team realised that TEE skills are also required for decisions
      beyond the cardiac surgical theaters where on the spot critical decisions making is required
      eg: in polytrauma and sudden unexplained hypotension or hypoxia in non-cardiac or ICU
      patients.

      There are existing induction modules and prior teaching avenues in the department of
      anaesthesia such as the Cardiac Anaesthesia Simulation Training (CAST) module targeted at
      junior trainee's level. With initiative to equip every practicing anaesthesiologist with the
      vital skill of TEE image acquisition, the department of anaesthesia is launching a teaching
      program that is an in house training session. The study team aims to understand through this
      study the ideal sequence of teaching intervention to facilitate optimal learning and
      retention.

    <intervention_model_description>The TEE session will consist of a 1-hour lecture and a 2-hour simulation session. Participants for the TEE session are divided into 2 groups. Trainee participants are randomly divided into groups A and B. The specialists are also randomly divided into groups C and D. Groups A and C undergo lecture first then simulation, whereas B and D undergo simulation first then lecture.
Prior to the teaching session (lecture or simulation), the participants will take a MCQ pre-test with 30 questions relating to TEE safety, probe manipulation and basic views in TEE. There is no pre-test on technical skill, as all of them are novices to TEE (i.e. with no skill on TEE). A post-test consisting of 30 MCQs (same as pre-test but in a different sequence) and a technical skill test is held at the completion of both lecture and simulation sessions.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Identify and compare whether there are demographic variations in knowledge and skill acquisition in TEE among anaesthesiologists within each sequence of teaching and learning (i.e. lecture followed by simulation training and simulation training followed by lecture). This will be done through the administration of 30-question MCQ relating to TEE safety, probe manipulation and basic views in TEE, and a technical skill test.</description>
