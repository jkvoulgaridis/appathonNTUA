  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of a medical consensus, the current management of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
      hypermobility type (hEDS) remains very speculative That's why investigators want in this
      study to demonstrate the beneficial contribution of an innovative therapeutic strategy
      combining reprogramming and substitution somatosensory. This therapy is based primarily on
      the somesthetic substitution provided by compression garments(VC). Indeed, the VC port
      associated with stimulation of the somesthetic system via a specific program of physiotherapy
      (e.e. centered on body awareness through movement) could potentiate the effectiveness of
      care, and therefore enhance its long-term beneficial effect. The patient could thus regain
      his mobility, his functional independence, and thus considerably increase its quality of
      life. Thereafter, the practice of an adapted physical activity (APA), by the sensory
      stimulation induced and its playful nature, will allow patients to preserve and sustain the
      benefits of taking load previously carried out. Validation of this therapeutic approach would
      offer an effective solution may subsequently be proposed to the entire medical profession as
      reference support in the treatment of the hEDS.

      This study plans to include, over a period of two years, 40 patients with hypermobile
      Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and 40 healthy volunteers controls. Patients will be followed for a
      period of one year divided into 3 periods of 4 months, between which they will be evaluated
      in order to quantify the impact of the intervention performed at each stage of the protocol.

      Each patient will benefit successively: from a classic care, over a period of 2 to 4 months,
      then will be treated with compressive garments or with low compressive garment during the
      next 4 months in association with proprioceptive physical therapy. Finally, the 4 last
      months, patient will participate in an APA with both dance sessions strengthening the body
      diagram and stretching sessions.

      The aim of this work is therefore to evaluate the effect of a treatment specifically oriented
      towards somatosensory remediation.
