  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study on the safety and tolerability of a new drug BAY2328065 when given increased doses as
      tablet or solution over 12 days to healthy male participants. Researcher want to study how
      the body absorbs, breaks down and excrete the new drug, also when given together with a test
      meal. In addition the study will investigate changes that take place in the body when
      BAY2328065 is given together with another drug.

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
