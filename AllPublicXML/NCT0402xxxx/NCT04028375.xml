    <textblock>
      It is very significant that assessing staging in gastric cancer patients before surgery,
      furthermore, determining the optimize surgical strategy ,predict the the efficacy of
      neoadjuvant therapy for patients. For patients who are ineffective in neoadjuvant therapy,
      surgery will be more meaningful.

      It has been reported that the application of CT(computed tomography,CT) and MR(magnetic
      resonance,MR) in staging of gastric cancer, but not in predicting clinical response to
      neoadjuvant therapy for gastric cancer. Only a few studies focused on T staging using
      conventional MRI in gastric cancer, however , relatively new sequences in the chest deserve
      widely used. To develop a pre-treatment evaluation methods for TN staging in patient with
      gastric cancer by utilization of the new imaging methods (T2-TSE-BLADE,T2 maps, StarVIBE,
      iShim-DWI and high resolution CT). By analysing the relationship between TN staging and
      imaging features to find the imaging characteristics for TN staging, and to find the
      indicators of new technology and reference values for facilitate pre-treatment diagnosis of
      TN staging, optimize surgical strategy , predict the the efficacy of adjunctive therapy , and
      OS and define the range of lymph node for radiotherapy , as making personal treatment
      planning for gastric cancer .

      To explore the value of CT and MR using multiple sequences, including T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps
      StarVIBE, and iShim-DWI in evaluating the preoperative TN staging and prediction of response
      to neoadjuvant therapy and OS in patients with gastric cancer.

      Patients with endoscopically biopsy-proven gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled for
      imaging on CT and a 3T MRI scanner . The MRI protocol included T2-TSE-BLADE, T2
      maps,iShim-DWI(diffusion weighted imaging,DWI)and StarVIBE sequences, and so on. Patients
      received treatment according to NCCN guideline(the National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network,NCCN). Readers assigned a TN stage on CT and MRI, and post-operative pathologic
      confirmation was considered the gold standard.

      Inter-reader agreement, the diagnostic accuracy of TN staging on CT and MRI were analyzed and
      compared to post-operative pathologic TN staging separately. MRI features were analyzed to
      find the correlation between pretreatment MRI features and response or OS. The study will
      include 400 patients. Inter-reader agreements of TN staging were analyzed excellent for CT
      and MRI. Diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI will be calculated separately.
