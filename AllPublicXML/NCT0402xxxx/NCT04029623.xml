    <textblock>
      Interventions that affect many different aspects of human ability rather than just one aspect
      of human health are more likely to be successful in preventing and treating Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Functional decline in AD is severely impacted by impaired ability to do
      physical actions while having to make decisions and concentrating, something scientists call
      motor-cognitive integration. Combined motor and cognitive training has been recommended for
      people with early AD, thus this study will use partnered, rhythmic rehabilitation (PRR), as
      an intervention to simultaneously target cardiovascular, social and motor-cognitive domains
      important to AD. PRR is moderate intensity, cognitively-engaging social dance that targets
      postural control systems, involves learning multiple, varied stepping and rhythmic patterns,
      and fosters tactile communication of motor goals between partners, enhancing social
      interaction's effect on cognition. Previous research demonstrates that PRR classes are safe
      and result in no injurious falls.

      This study is a 12-month long Phase II single- blind randomized clinical trial using PRR in
      66 patients with early AD. Participants with early AD will be randomly assigned to
      participate in PRR or a walking program for three months of biweekly sessions, followed by
      nine months of weekly sessions of PRR or walking. The overarching hypothesis is that PRR is
      safe, tolerable and associated with improved motor-cognitive function, and brain (neuronal),
      vascular (blood vessels) and inflammatory biomarkers that might affect function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For people with early Alzheimer's disease (AD), treatment options to prevent declined
      function are extremely limited, because AD affects many areas of function. In early AD,
      people may have trouble physically doing things while also thinking, which is necessary for
      many activities in daily life. This problem might be helped by doing activities that
      challenge the mind and the body at the same time. Partnered rhythmic rehabilitation (PRR),
      which targets fitness, cognition, mobility and social engagement and may prevent future
      functional problems in AD.

      This is a phase II single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability,
      and efficacy of PRR in individuals in the early stages of AD, also called prodromal AD (pAD)
      . Participants will be randomly assigned to 90-minute PRR or WALK classes. Both interventions
      will receive equal contact and monitoring from study staff. Participants will have two phases
      of intervention. In the three-month Training phase, participants will be assigned to 20,
      biweekly (90-minute) lessons over 12 weeks. In the nine-month Maintenance phase, participants
      will attend weekly lessons at least 3 times per month. Participants will undergo either PRR
      or Walking Exercise (WALK) interventions for one year, which will use de-escalating doses:
      two times per week for three months (Training) and weekly for nine months (Maintenance).

      The first study aim is to determine acceptability, safety, tolerability and satisfaction with
      PRR in pAD. The second aim is to determine a) efficacy of PRR vs. WALK for improving
      motor-cognitive integration in pAD; b) to identify sensitive endpoints to power a future
      phase III trial. The researchers will also explore potential mechanisms by which PRR affects
      pAD. These mechanisms include functional brain measures, vascular, and inflammation measures
      (arterial stiffness; cerebral perfusion, task functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI];
      inflammatory markers: cytokines and chemokines, endothelial adhesion markers.

    <measure>Change in Four Square Step Test (FSST) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Four Square Step Test (FSST) assesses mechanisms underlying motor-cognitive integration. FSST requires participants to step clockwise then counterclockwise into four squares created by rods arranged on the ground in a cross. Participants are instructed to perform FSST &quot;as quickly and as safely as you can,&quot; to not touch the rods and make both feet contact the floor in each square. Timing begins when the participant initiates movement and stops when both feet are back in the starting square after completing the sequence. Trials will be repeated if the participant does not understand the instructions, fails to complete the sequence accurately, loses balance, or touches a rod. Three successful trials will be recorded and fastest time selected for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change in Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by conducting two pre-session focus groups with 8-10 pAD participants. Focus groups will assess barriers and facilitators of PRR as therapy for motor-cognitive performance of functional activity issues. Post training, the researchers will conduct two focus groups with 8 participants each to assess satisfaction with PRR, perceived effect of PRR on participation in life's activities, impact of touch on therapy, overall perceived impact of cognitive impairment on benefits/results from PRR, and solicit recommendations for improvement. Responses will be open ended rather than on a pre-determined scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body Position Spatial Task (BPST), is a validated visuospatial memory task. The BPST incorporates spatial memory and navigational skills while maintaining posture. The examiner verbally and visually shows a series of side, forward and turning steps, which the examinee repeats. If the examinee repeats the entire pattern correctly they are scored with a 1; any incorrect parts of the pattern mean the score will be 0. Participants complete up to 8 different sequences, and have up to 2 tries to perform the sequence correctly. Total scores can range from 0 to 8, with higher values indicating more sequences correctly performed.</description>

    <description>Partnered Rhythmic Rehabilitation (PRR) is moderate intensity, cognitively-engaging social dance that targets postural control systems. PRR involves learning complex stepping patterns and fosters tactile communication of motor goals between partners, enhancing social interaction's effect on cognition. Class sizes will consist of 10 or fewer pairs of participants with pAD and partners to maximize safety. Participants will engage in partnering exercises on how to interpret motor goals through touch, exercises to develop understanding of temporal relationship of movement to music, novel step introduction, connecting previously learned and novel step elements. Classes include practicing previously-learned steps, a 20-minute standing warm-up, and partnering and rhythmic enhancement exercises.</description>

    <description>WALK sessions consist of 10 minutes of warm-up, and evaluation/tips for practicing safe walking form mechanics (i.e., head up, shoulders relaxed, abdominals engaged, heel strike, roll and toe off; keep natural stride length, and speed up cadence if increased speed is desired), 55 minutes of walking with breaks, and 20 minutes of balance and stretching. WALK will take place in small groups with research assistants and trained family members and/or caregivers to control for social effects/contact of intervention. Participants of similar walking abilities will be 'buddied' with research assistants and trained physical therapy students who will act as group backmarkers, although participants will lead the pace. WALK participants will keep walking logs documenting their progress. WALK is expected to expend 3 metabolic equivalents (METs), like that of PRR.</description>
