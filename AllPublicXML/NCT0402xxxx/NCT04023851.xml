  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to evaluate the impact of mobile application on management and
      knowledge acquisition in patients with epilepsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators assess the general and personal knowledge of epilepsy, compliance of
      antiepileptic drugs (AED), and self efficacy scale. Participants be asked to use the mobile
      application (Brain4U) and record seizure type, frequency of seizures, aggravating factors,
      and adverse events related to antiepileptic drugs for 2 month period.

    <measure>Evaluation of knowledge acquisition in epilepsy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and 2 month Timepoint scores from questionnaires are assessed. Improvement in knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy by using questionnaire.
Genetal knowledge (G) Questionnaire:
There are total 10 questions (1 point score for each question) to evaluate general knowlege about epilepsy.
Score reported as (mean, SD), higher scores are better. Score ranges 0 to 10.
Persional knowledge (P) questionnaire:
There are total 4 questions (1 point score for each question) to evaluate knowlege about individual's epilepsy.
Score reported as (mean, SD), higher scores are better. Score ranges 0 to 4.
Self-efficacy scale (SE): There are 4 questions (1 point score for each question) to evaluate self-efficacy scale.
Score reported as (mean, SD), higher scores are better. Score ranges 0 to 4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AED compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and 2 month Timepoint AED compliances are reported.
Assess improvement of AED compliance by comparing &quot;Days with AED per month&quot; before and after using mobile application.
Count the &quot;Days with AED&quot; in a month and converted to the percentage.
Percentage ranges 0 to 100%. The high percentage means good compliance which means less AED skipping in a month.</description>
