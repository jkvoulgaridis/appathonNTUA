      This study is designed to treat benign ureteral stricture with balloon dilatation through
      prospective multicenter studies. It aims to indications, procedure standards, and therapeutic
      effects of balloon dilation, and provide further guidance for endoscopic treatment of benign
      ureteral stricture.

    <textblock>
      Benign ureteral stricture refers to a urinary tract obstruction caused by a partial or full
      ureteral lumen that is less normal than normal. It can lead to urinary dilatation, water
      accumulation, and renal colic in the upper segment of the stenosis. If treat not in time, it
      will affect renal function and even causes irreversible kidney failure.In recent years, with
      the development of endoscopic techniques, it provides a cost-effective and less invasive
      treatment for the treatment of ureteral stricture. In recent years, with the development of
      endoscopic techniques, it has provided a cost-effective and less invasive treatment for the
      treatment of ureteral stricture, and has achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, more and
      more urologists choose to treat ureteral stricture under endoscopy. The techniques of urinary
      endoscopic treatment of benign ureteral stricture include ureteral balloon dilatation,
      ureteral holmium laser incision, and ureteral stent implantation. Among them, the ureteral
      balloon dilatation technique is characterized by the use of a balloon to uniformly force the
      ureteral wall, tearing the narrow scar tissue, expanding the inner diameter of the ureter,
      recanalizing the urinary tract, and alleviating hydronephrosis. It have been reported with
      less complications and simple procedure. However, there's still no consensus on its treatment
      indication，procedure standards and curative effect. This study is designed to treat benign
      ureteral stricture with balloon dilatation through prospective multicenter studies. It aims
      to indications, procedure standards, and therapeutic effects of balloon dilation, and provide
      further guidance for endoscopic treatment of benign ureteral stricture.
