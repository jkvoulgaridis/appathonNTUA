  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to collect and identify key outcome measures or disease parameters in ME/CFS
      that are altered during elevated symptoms relative to baseline by gathering information
      before and after symptom provocation using a two-day cardiopulmonary exercise test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phenomenon of post-exertional malaise (PEM), in which an ME/CFS patient's symptoms are
      elevated following even low-level exertion, is a hallmark feature of the disease. The cause
      of PEM, like the cause of ME/CFS, is not understood. This study aims to utilize a two-day
      CPET to invoke PEM. This provides a unique opportunity to collect data on how key outcome
      measures or disease parameters are altered during elevated symptoms relative to baseline
      within each patient by gathering information before and after symptom provocation.

      A total of 90 participants and 90 controls will undergo CPET testing. Participation will be
      split amongst three different sites (Ithaca, NY, New York, NY, and Los Angeles, CA). Subjects
      will be located in urban and rural areas to establish relatively diverse study populations.

      This study is a component of the Cornell ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center (CRC). Blood
      samples taken before and after CPET will be utilized in associated projects with the Cornell
      ME/CFS CRC. CPET data along with the analysis of blood samples has great potential to reveal
      why exercise negatively affects ME/CFS patients and thus perhaps why patients are also
      impaired even before increasing their activity level.

    <description>A series of two cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) performed over two days. Participants will perform a CPET and then will return approximately 24 hours later to perform the second CPET. The CPET begins with 3 minutes of seated rest followed by cycling during incremental workloads which increases 15 watts throughout each minute of exercise. The participant will cycle until volitional exhaustion and/or the participant and/or test administrator determines to stop the test. Actual exercise time usually varies between 8-10 minutes.</description>
