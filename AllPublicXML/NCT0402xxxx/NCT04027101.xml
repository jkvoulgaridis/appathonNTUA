  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recent PMR(6 months or less) with a PMR-AS &gt;17 and no oral or parenteral GCs
      during the past 2 weeks (at least) will be included.

      Treatment with oral baricitinib 4mg or placebo during 12 weeks and then, if PMR-AS≤10, they
      will receive baricitinib 2 mg for 12 weeks and then will stop treatment.

      No rescue is allowed before week 4 (visit 3) but patients may receive up to 2 intra-articular
      or soft tissue injections of GCs until week 4 according to investigator's opinion.

      From week 4 to week 12, steroids will be proposed as a rescue for both arms at investigators'
      discretion and according to PMR-AS.

    <description>The activity of Polymyalgia Rheumatica is evaluated using the Polymyalgia Rheumatica Activity score (PMR-AS), a disease activity score based on morning stiffness, ability to elevate the upper limbs, physician's global disease assessment , Visual Analog Score for patient's pain (VAS), and CRP level. The PMR-AS is considered as relevant to define relapse and remission but also to decide if treatment have to be decreased, unchanged or increased (PMR-AS &lt; 10: decrease, PMR-AS &gt; 17 increase to previous dosage, 10 ≤ PMR-AS ≤ 17: stable dose)</description>

The EQ-5D scale is a standardised measure of health status to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal, whih is divided by the EQ-5D descriptive system (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems).</description>
