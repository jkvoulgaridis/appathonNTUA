  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study to understand the impact of a digital health system, including a phone app and a
      vaginal probe to treat fecal incontinence in women
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening will complete training in
      behavioral therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and training in the use of the
      Leva pelvic digital health system.

      Subjects will then participate in 10 weeks of at home pelvic floor muscle training using the
      leva device twice daily for 2 ½ minutes of training.

      Adherence to the training protocol will be observed digitally, and subjects will receive
      phone calls every other week from research assistants reviewing their adherence.

      Subjects are expected to participate in at least 80% of the weekly exercises (11 weekly).

      Subjects will return to clinic at 5- and 10-weeks during the study to complete
      questionnaires. At 5-weeks, subjects will review the use of the device with the study
      assistant, who will answer any questions and repeat training if the subject desires
      additional training.

      Following 10 weeks of training, subjects will be free to pursue any additional therapies, but
      will also retain the leva device and may continue its use if desired. Adherence will be
      monitored for one additional year, with follow up surveys to be completed by mail or
      digitally at 6- and 12-months
