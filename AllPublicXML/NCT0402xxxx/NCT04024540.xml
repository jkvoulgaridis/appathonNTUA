  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, two-armed study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      isocaloric dietary restriction in the treatment of obese without diabetic for a period of 3
      months. Then, participants would be given dietary guidance and health education and followed
      up for 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, two arms trial. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      72 eligible patients, who are 18-45 years old, with BMI between 35 to 45kg/m2 are assigned to
      one of two intervention groups: isocaloric dietary restriction; bariatric surgery. The main
      purpose of this study is to clarify the efficacy of isocaloric dietary restriction, compared
      to bariatric surgery, in losing weight and improving metabolic factors. This is an
      investigator-initiated study performed by department of endocrinology and metabolic disease,
      Ruijin hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine.
