    <textblock>
      IMPAACT 2016 is a multi-site, two-arm, individually randomized, controlled study to evaluate
      whether an Indigenous Leader Outreach Model (ILOM) of trauma-informed cognitive behavioral
      therapy (TI-CBT) delivered by Indigenous Youth Leaders (IYL) is associated with improved
      mental health outcomes and ART adherence among youth living with HIV in resource-limited
      settings. The intervention is adapted to the local context through advance conduct of focus
      groups and pilot testing.

      IMPAACT 2016 is a multi-site, two-arm, individually randomized, controlled study to evaluate
      whether an Indigenous Leader Outreach Model (ILOM) of trauma-informed cognitive behavioral
      therapy (TI-CBT) delivered by Indigenous Youth Leaders (IYL) is associated with improved
      mental health outcomes and ART adherence among youth living with HIV in resource-limited
      settings. To adapt the intervention for the local context, the trial will be preceded by an
      adaption of the TI-CBT intervention at each site using the &quot;ADAPT-ITT&quot; model, which includes
      focus groups and pilot tests. In the randomized study, youth will be individually randomized
      to either the TI-CBT Intervention Arm or the Discussion Control Arm. Participants will meet
      as a group within their randomized arm and receive multiple group sessions within an
      eight-week period. Each group will include an average of eight youth for an approximate total
      of 192-256 youth in the Randomized Trial (96-128 youth per arm). TI-CBT and Discussion
      Control groups in each arm will be mixed-gender unless it is determined necessary to have
      single-gender groups during the focus group. Caregivers (as available and with youth
      permission) will be assigned to the same study arm as their youth. Caregivers will meet as a
      group for two caregiver-specific sessions on two separate weeks and separate from their youth
      group sessions. Youth and caregivers will complete a follow-up visit immediately after their
      last group session and two additional follow-up visits at six and 12 months. Youth and
      caregivers will also receive one two-hour booster group session consistent with their
      assigned study arm immediately after the six-month evaluations. The booster sessions are
      intended to enhance treatment effects and increase sustainability. Once all participants have
      completed their six-month evaluations, data from these evaluations will be analyzed to
      determine the short-term effects of the intervention. Additional analyses to assess the
      longer-term effects of the intervention, including the effects of the booster group session,
      will be performed after the completion of follow-up.

    <intervention_model_description>In the Randomized Trial, youth participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio with their caregivers to one of two study arms. One arm is the TI-CBT intervention arm: six 2-hour TI-CBT group sessions lead by Indigenous Youth Leaders (IYL) during weeks 1 - 6 and one 2-hour booster group session at 6-months. The caregivers participating for youth who are enrolled into the TI-CBT arm will receive two 2-hour group sessions led by adult study staff during weeks 1-6 and one 2-hour booster group session at 6-months.
The other arm is the discussion control arm consisting of: six 2 hour discussion group sessions lead by IYL during weeks 1-6 and one 2-hour booster discussion group session at 6 months. The caregivers of youth randomized to the discussion control arm will have two 2-hour discussion group sessions led by adult study staff during weeks 1-6 and one 2-hour booster discussion group session at 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>TI-CBT teaches techniques and ways to manage distress through psychosocial health education, cognitive restructuring, and &quot;mastery of trauma&quot;, which refers to the process by which survivors of psychological trauma work through the traumatic experience in a meaningful way, and are able to move on with life. TI-CBT addresses both the trauma of learning one has HIV and the trauma associated with managing a chronic and stigmatized illness. The intervention highlights links between HIV and traditional gender roles, gender inequities, and gender based violence. Finally, the relaxation training teaches youth strategies to relax and these are integrated at the beginning and end of each session. TI-CBT Youth and Caregiver Intervention Manuals are distributed to sites for translation, backtranslation, and cultural adaptation in preparation for the Randomized Trial.</description>

To note, participant and caregiver group sessions are always held separately.</description>
