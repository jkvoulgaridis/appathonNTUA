    <textblock>
      In the present project the investigators propose to test the efficacy of a peer to peer
      program entitled Airman's Edge. The Airman's Edge program plans to utilize peer mentors that
      will be trained in specialized skills designed to impact suicide risk at multiple levels of
      the military community without creating &quot;extra duties&quot; that increase workload and interfere
      with mission demands. Peer mentors will introduce primary prevention strategies to their
      units that target broad-based risk factors across the entire population (i.e., sleep
      disturbance, social support, meaning in life, firearm safety) with secondary prevention
      strategies that target individual-level risk factors (i.e., crisis response planning, firearm
      safety counseling). Peer mentors will complete a structured training process using existing
      curriculum and procedures that have been tested and refined within military groups. Peers
      mentors will also participate in monthly consultation calls with the investigative team to
      receive ongoing support, share resources and lessons learned, and address challenges and
      barriers to program implementation.

      The purpose of the Airman's Edge peer to peer program is to influence indicators of suicide
      risk among military personnel at two levels, group and individual, consistent with the
      program's hybrid design that combines group-based education and individual-level suicide
      prevention skills training. The hypotheses are therefore designed to examine outcomes and
      effects at multiple levels of the community, which could inform subsequent implementation and
      translational efforts. The following aims are proposed:

      Aim 1: To test the efficacy of a peer to peer program for the reduction of suicidal behavior
      among military personnel.

      Aim 2: To identify moderators and mediators of the peer to peer program's effects on suicidal
      behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicides among military personnel doubled from 2001 to 2015 and have remained elevated.
      Although new treatments and interventions have been shown to reduce the occurrence of
      suicidal behavior, they are predominantly available only in mental health clinics. Data
      indicates that the large majority of military personnel who die by suicide do not access
      mental healthcare services in the months preceding their deaths. New strategies that are
      based on these empirically-supported interventions but can be delivered outside the mental
      healthcare system, thereby reaching a larger proportion of the military community, are
      therefore needed. Peer to peer (P2P) support programs hold promise as a method for achieving
      these aims, but the evidence supporting this intervention model remains limited or, in the
      case of suicide prevention, absent. In light of this gap, the proposed project aims to test
      the efficacy of a P2P program for the reduction of suicidal behaviors among military
      personnel. The proposed P2P program, called Airman's Edge, is a hybrid model that includes
      both group-based peer educator and individual-based peer support components; these P2P
      program models have demonstrated the strongest outcomes with respect to changing attitudes,
      perspectives, and behaviors, all of which are key targets for reducing suicidal thoughts and
      behaviors. The Airman's Edge program is comprised of several skills-based strategies that
      have been shown to directly reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors (i.e., sleep habits,
      firearm safety procedures, crisis response planning), and targets population-level contextual
      variables known to reduce suicide risk (i.e., purpose and meaning in life, social support).
      The mechanisms by which these strategies reduce suicidal behavior align with an
      empirically-supported conceptual model, the suicidal mode, which has guided recent advances
      in military suicide prevention. The delivery platform for the skills-based strategies
      employed in the Airman's Edge program have demonstrated very good acceptability and
      feasibility when used with military personnel.

    <intervention_model_description>The study design entails a dynamic wait list design in which participants are randomly assigned to either the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) program or a wait list control condition. Randomization will be conducted at the squadron level using a computerized randomization algorithm.
The proposed dynamic wait list design differs primarily from the traditional wait list designs with respect to timing of intervention. In the traditional wait list design, half of the squadrons (i.e., N/2) would be randomized to implement the P2P program early in the study and the remaining half would implement the P2P program later in the study. By contrast, the dynamic wait list randomizes the timing of the intervention over the entire course of the study period by first dividing the overall study period into m equal time blocks, and then randomizing N/m squadrons to receive the P2P program during each time block.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Data analyses will be conducted by a quantitative psychology postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Brian Baucom, PhD, at The University of Utah, and Kent Corso, PsyD, BCBA-D, at Xcelerate Innovations. Dr. Baucom serves on the University of Utah's Department of Psychology's Statistical Consulting Service, and has prior experience with clinical trial methodology and military research. Dr. Corso is a certified behavior analyst with extensive experience using single case design methodology and applying this approach to military settings. None of the data analysts will be involved in data collection procedures, and will remain therefore blind to treatment assignment. Prior to statistical analyses, data will be screened to identify distributional properties.</masking_description>
