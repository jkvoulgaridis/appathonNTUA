      Upper limb (UL) impairment is a common deficit following stroke with only an estimated 20 per
      cent of patients recovering function. Pain associated with UL impairment due to
      multifactorial causes is a frequent symptom in patients with stroke. Occupational therapy
      techniques focus on the implementation of positioning techniques and the use of supportive
      devices (SD) such as slings aimed to prevent pain; therefore increase daily function,
      participation and hence quality of life. At present, positioning principles of the hemiplegic
      shoulder exist in clinical practice. These are aimed at prevention of pain associated with UL
      Impairment; however there is no clear consensus among professionals of particular SD that
      should be implemented for adults with stroke
