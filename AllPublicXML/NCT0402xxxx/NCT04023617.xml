    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single-center, open-label, phase II clinical trial designed to
      evaluate non-small cell lung cancer that has failed to undergo excessive platinum-based
      chemotherapy and has not received excessive statin chemotherapy and has not received
      immunotherapy. The efficacy and safety of Nivolumab in combination with docetaxel and
      Nivolumab in patients.

      Qualified patients were stratified by histological type (squamous cell carcinoma vs.
      non-squamous cell carcinoma) randomized to receive the following regimen in a 1:1 ratio:

      Group A: Nivolumab 300mg + docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV q3w Group B: Nivolumab 200mg IV q2w All
      patients were evaluated for tumor at baseline, and tumor evaluations were performed every 6
      weeks within 48 weeks after randomization (regardless of whether dosing was delayed). After
      the 48th week of assessment, a tumor assessment is required every 9 weeks until disease
      progression, withdrawal of informed consent, sponsor termination study, or patient death.

      Nivolumab and Docetaxel have been approved as standard second-line treatments for non-small
      cell lung cancer in several countries including China and the United States.

    <description>Nivolumab was administered at a dose of 300 mg on the first day of the 21-day cycle (every 3 weeks; q3w) when combined with docetaxel, and administered at a dose of 200 mg on the first day of each 14-day cycle (every 2 weeks; q2w) after stopping docetaxel treatment.
On the first day of each cycle (21 days), docetaxel 75 mg/m2 was infused by IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4-6 cycles (judged by investigator).</description>

          1. Men &amp; women ≥18, and ≤75 years of age.

          2. Subjects with histologically or cytologically-documented non-squamous cell NSCLC who
             present with Stage IIIB/IV disease or recurrent or progressive disease following
             multimodal therapy (radiation therapy, surgical resection, or definitive
             chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced disease) and who will receive study
             therapy as second line of treatment for advanced disease.

             limited to exon 19 deletion mutation or exon 21 L858R mutation, exon 21 L861Q, exon 18
             G719X or exon 20 S768I site Mutation) and ALK gene rearrangement. If the pathology is

             inhibitors targeting PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4.

             detected a new asymptomatic CNS metastasis during the screening scan, then
             radiotherapy must be received) And/or central nervous system metastases. After
             treatment, these patients do not require additional brain scans to enter the trial if
             other inclusion criteria are met.

             findings, including but not limited to: persistent or active infection, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, poorly controlled hypertension, Unstable angina, arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric/social conditions that affect the study's requirements, significantly
             increase the risk of AEs in the study drug, or affect the patient's ability to provide
