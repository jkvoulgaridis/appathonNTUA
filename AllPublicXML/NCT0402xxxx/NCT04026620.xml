  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screen women of childbearing age (14 - 44 years) for high risk drinking in antenatal clinics
      of the established research sites in the Western Cape Province of South Africa (SA). While
      there are multiple reasons for this screening, the purpose is for selective (secondary)
      prevention of FASD. A.) Initiate a case control trial/efficacy study (n=400) of the use of
      one-session brief motivation enhancement therapy (MET) in busy public health settings (versus
      information only) in these rich research sites where very high rates of FASD have been
      documented over the entirety of the past two decades. B.) These targeted prevention
      activities follow both findings and staff experience in prevention over the past decade which
      indicate that the most likely venue for prevention activities is in antenatal clinics of the
      local, primary care clinics and hospitals. These activities will also provide tangible
      community-level pay back for participation in ongoing research activities and lay the
      groundwork for sustainable services going forward.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 400 women who screen positive for drinking will be asked if they want to be enrolled in the efficacy trial. Once a participant enrolls into the efficacy trial study, they are then randomly assigned to either the MET (Motivational Enhancement Therapy) group or informational pamphlet-only group. The MET group will be provided: 1.) a one (1) hour and 30 minute MET session, 2.) an information pamphlet on FASD written in simple Afrikaans, and 3.) a logo tea/coffee mug to take home. Women in the control condition will receive two informational pamphlets (one on FASD advising abstinence from alcohol use and one describing fetal development, both in Afrikaans). The data obtained by nurses during a woman's initial prenatal clinic visit for all 400 participants (Self-administered Questionnaire and AUDIT), will be matched with deliveries of the newborns to monitor the birth outcomes of newborns of participating mothers.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) Score over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AUDIT is a 10-item, self-report, screening tool to assess alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems. The AUDIT was developed and adopted by the World Health Organization. AUDIT scoring for questions 1 to 8 are scored on a five-point scale from 0,1,2,3, and 4; questions 9 and 10 are scored on a three-point scale from 0,2, and 4. The maximum score for the AUDIT is 40. AUDIT Total Score of 0-7 indicates a low-risk level; a score of 8-15 is risky or hazardous level; a score of 16-19 is a high-risk or harmful level; and 20 or more is considered high-risk/almost certainly dependent on alcohol.</description>

The face-to-face session will provide information to help people and pregnant women who want to change their drinking behavior, become 'dry' and stay motivated to change their drinking behaviors. Sessions will be approximately one (1) hour and 30 minutes.</description>
