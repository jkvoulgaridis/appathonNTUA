      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of a group prenatal care (GPNC) intervention designed to reduce the risk for obesity related
      health conditions during and after pregnancy in overweight/obese mothers and their infants in
      American Samoa.

    <description>GPNC participants will attend 11 group sessions total: 10 during pregnancy and one postpartum. Each session will be 90-100 minutes long. Groups will collectively identify the preferred time of day for these sessions. Groups of 10 women will be led by a locally trained, Samoan nurse-midwife with the study Project Director as a co-facilitator. At each of the visits participants will engage in self-assessments of weight and blood pressure, including learning to take their blood pressure with a digital cuff, calculating BMI, and plotting their weight gain on a graph), receive short individual clinical examinations from a midwife, and participate in group discussions about prenatal care, childbirth preparation, and their postpartum care. The session at 6-weeks postpartum will allow women to introduce their babies to the group and share childbirth stories.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥18 years of age. We will exclude younger pregnant women because adolescents may still
             be experiencing their own growth and development, which would be a source of
             confounding for our study outcomes.

          -  Self-reported Samoan ethnicity. Based on all four grandparents (of the participant)
             being reported as Samoa. Other ethnic groups make up approximately 2% of the American
             Samoan population but we are specifically interested in determining the efficacy of
             this intervention fro Samoan women, who have considerably poorer health outcomes in
             this setting.

          -  English speaking. The intervention will be delivered primarily in English, as is usual
             for standard prenatal care in this setting, with some Samoan language likely to be
             used in group discussions. Take home materials will be provided in both English and
             Samoan.

          -  Planning to reside in American Samoa for the duration of pregnancy and until at least
             6 weeks postpartum. Some women travel from the neighboring country of Samoa
             (Independent/Western Samoa) to receive prenatal care at LBJTMC. These women will be
             excluded based on the need to receive all intervention sessions and a postpartum
             follow up.

          -  Singleton, viable pregnancy. A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton before 140 weeks by
             project gestational age is acceptable. An ultrasound must be conducted before
             randomization that shows a fetal heartbeat; there must be no evidence of more than one
             fetus on the most recent pre-randomization ultrasound. Including multiple pregnancies
             would confound study outcomes.

          -  Completed LBJTMC prenatal care enrollment visit. Participants must have enrolled in
             standard prenatal care and received a standard of care physical exam, ultrasound,
             confirmation of pregnancy dating, pregnancy history, and preliminary gestational
             diabetes screen to ensure that no pregnancy health-based exclusion criteria (see
             below) are met. Participants must obtain written documentation from their provider of
             this visit, and permission from them to participate in the GPNC study.

          -  Gestational age at randomization no earlier than 11 weeks 0 days and no later than 14
             weeks 0 days based on an algorithm that compares the last menstrual period date and
             data from the enrollment ultrasound. This will ensure that each participant is exposed
             to the intervention for the same amount of time.

          -  Body mass index ≥ 26kg/m2 based on measured weight at enrollment and on measured
             height. The earliest weight measurement before randomization, measured specifically
             for the study will be used. A BMI cutpoint of 26 kg/m2 is used in line with the usual
             upward-adjusted criteria for overweight in populations of Polynesian descent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years because of the potential for growth during pregnancy and the
             need for participant informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes prior to pregnancy or an HbA1C ≥ 6.5% or other glucose tolerance
             test result suggestive of pre-pregnancy diabetes. All potential participants will have
             HbA1C or an alternative test performed prior to randomization at their standard
             prenatal care enrollment visit.

          -  Gestational diabetes or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy

          -  Known fetal anomaly/pregnancy health condition known to require specialist
             monitoring/treatment

          -  Planned termination of pregnancy

          -  Past history of anorexia or bulimia by medical history or patient report. Binge eating
             disorder (BED) is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Current eating disorder diagnosed by a clinician

          -  Prior bariatric surgery

          -  Current use of one or more of the following medications:

               -  Metformin

               -  Systemic steroids

               -  Antipsychotic agents (e.g. Abilify, Haldol, Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa)

               -  Anti-seizure medications or mood stabilizers that would be expected to have a
                  significant impact on body weight (e.g Depakote, Lamictal, Lithium, Neurontin,
                  Tegretol, Topamax, Keppra)

               -  Medications for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) including
                  amphetamines and methylphenidate

          -  Continued use of weight loss medication including Over The Counter (OTC) and dietary
             supplements for weight loss (e.g. Adipex, Suprenza, Tenuate, Xenical, Alli, conjugated
             linoleic acid, Hoodia, Green tea extract, Guar gum, Hydroxycut, Sensa, Corti-Slim,
             Chromium, Chitosan, Bitter Orange)

          -  Contraindications to aerobic exercise in pregnancy specified by the American College
             of Obstetrics and Gynocology (ACOG) committee Opinion #267, 2002 (re-affirmed 2009)

          -  Participation in another interventional study that influences weight control

          -  Participants unwillingness or inability to commit to a six-week postpartum follow up
             of herself or her child, including planning to move away

          -  Untreated medical or psychiatric condition (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder) that
             could impede study participation

          -  Hospitalization for hyperemesis
