        Patients who underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy for physical examination in Qilu
        Hospital of Shandong University, China, from January 2017 to September 2018, were
        retrospectively reviewed. Subjects who had a history of gastrointestinal surgery or
        subjects who did not finish the endoscopic examination were excluded. All selected subjects
        were age- and sex- matched to form two groups: Group 1, medical staff from Qilu Hospital,
        and Group 2, general population.
