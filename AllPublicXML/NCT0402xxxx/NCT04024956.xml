  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyganics BV (Groningen, The Netherlands), in close collaboration with University
      Hospital-Eppendorf (UKE) Hamburg, has developed the Sealing Device for use in
      hepato-pancreato-bilary (HPB) surgery to reduce leakage of fluids from the site of surgery
      into the abdominal cavity and as an adjunctive hemostatic device to control minimal to
      moderate bleeding at the surgical site. The Sealing Device has been challenged in
      pre-clinical testing (laboratory and in-vivo work), but has not been evaluated for safety and
      performance in humans.

      This investigation will be conducted to clinically assess the safety and performance of
      Sealing Device as a means to reduce bile and pancreatic juice leakage in
      hepato-pancreato-bilary (HPB) surgery. Secondarily, the control of minimal to moderate
      bleeding will be assessed. To achieve adequate representation of the primary objective, the
      study will contain two separate surgical patient groups: Liver and Pancreas.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate safety and performance in reducing
      intra- and post-operative leakage (bile and pancreatic juices) by using the Sealing Device in
      patients undergoing elective hepatic resection or distal pancreatectomy.

      The study will be conducted as an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study with a 16 months
      follow up. Up to 80 patients (40 liver and 40 pancreas patients) will be enrolled at up to 7
      sites in Europe.
