             charbroiled meats) within 1 week before dosing

         19. Intake of herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort within 4 weeks before dosing
             Intake of over-the-counter (OTC) medications within 14 days (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer) before dosing unless the investigator and sponsor medical monitor
             consider that they do not compromise participant safety or study assessments

         20. Use of any prescription drugs within 4 weeks before dosing
