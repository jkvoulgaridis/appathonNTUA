      An open-label, single arm phase II study of the candidate Ebola Vaccine
      Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN®-Filo
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, single arm, open-label, non-randomized, phase II study to
      accumulate additional data on immunogenicity and safety of Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN®-Filo against
      Ebola virus disease.

      It also has a qualitative component to better understand knowledge about Ebola virus disease
      and the perception and attitudes towards the vaccine amongst participants (Healthcare and
      Frontline workers).

             vaccination.

             OR Not of childbearing potential: postmenopausal (&gt;45 years of age with amenorrhea for
             at least 2 years or ≤45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months);

             salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy); or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy.

             Note: If the social situation of a woman changes after start of the study (eg, woman

             (HAART), taking into account the following criteria:

               1. HAART is defined as potent anti-HIV treatment including a combination of ≥3
                  antiretroviral agents (ARVs; low-dose ritonavir does not count as an ARV) whose
                  purpose is to reduce viral load to undetectable levels. Mono- or bitherapy will
                  not be allowed.

               2. HAART is considered stable if participants did not change their ARVs within the
                  last 4 consecutive weeks prior to start of screening. Changes in formulations are
                  allowed.

             investigator's clinical judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any potential participant who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participating in the study.
