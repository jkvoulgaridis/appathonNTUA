      This study evaluates the KONTAKT social skills group training in Australian children on the
      autism spectrum compared to an active control group which is a group cooking class

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KONTAKT is a manualized Social Skills Group Training program designed for children and
      adolescents with ASD which aims to improve communication, social interaction skills, reduce
      the severity of ASD symptoms, improve the ability to empathise and adapt in a group setting.
      A large randomized controlled trial in Sweden found that adolescents who participated in
      KONTAKT demonstrated improvements in social skills, behaviour, reduced stress and improved
      overall functioning as reported by parents immediately following and at three months after
      the program. However, social skills are at least in part influenced by social cultural
      contexts and there is a need to understand the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness
      of KONTAKT in an Australian context. Moreover, in the previous studies, the social skills
      groups were compared to treatment as usual groups. Therefore, this study evaluates the
      KONTAKT social skills group training in Australian children on the autism spectrum compared
      to an active control group which is a group cooking class

    <measure>Change in the Emotion Regulation and Social Skills Questionnaire (ERSSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Post-test (week 20) and follow up (week 36) and long follow up (74 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The parents will fill this questionnaire (Parent form). This is a 27-item measure assessing emotion regulation and competency in social skills.The questionnaire is designed to measure frequencies of effective engagement in social behaviours (e.g. &quot;chooses appropriate solutions to social problems&quot; or &quot;deals effectively with bullying&quot;), examining the competency of these skills. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from &quot;never (0)&quot; to &quot;always (4)&quot;, yielding a total score of 0-108, with higher scores indicating higher competencies in social behaviour.</description>

    <measure>Change in Emotion Recognition and gaze fixation patterns</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Post-test (week 20) and follow up (week 36)</time_frame>
    <description>The children will fill this questionnaire. Emotions are displayed in the form of 2-5 second silent coloured video clips, with 4 multiple choice options one of which is the correct emotion label and 3 are distractor items. The distracter options were randomly selected from the entire Mind reading battery emotion groups, excluding the emotion group the target stimuli originates from. During the presentation of stimuli, eye tracking data will be recorded via a Remote Eye Tracker Device (RED) developed by SensoMotoric Instruments, enabling examination of fixation patterns and fixation durations.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Negative Incidents and Effects of Psychological Treatment (NEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-test (week 20)</time_frame>
    <description>The parents (parent proxy) will fill this questionnaire. The NEQ is a 32-item questionnaire requiring adolescents to quantify, on 5-point Likert scale with response options ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Extremely&quot;, any negative events experienced during the intervention period, asking participants to attribute their causality to either the program or external circumstances</description>

    <measure>Change in the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Post-test (week 20) and follow up (week 36) and long follow up (74 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The children will fill this questionnaire. This is a 9-dimension Health related quality of life scale (worried, sad, pain, tired, annoyed, school work, sleep, daily routines and activities), designed to estimate the adolescent's Quality adjusted life years (QALY), providing a standardized measure of disease burden. The measure is rated on a 5-point scale with a &quot;don't&quot; sentence linked with no problems (e.g. I don't feel sad today) and &quot;very&quot; with the participant experiencing a lot of problems (e.g. I feel very sad). Calculation of an universal score is supported by an adolescent specific scoring algorithm, with 1 representing 'full health' and 0 'death'.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Social responsiveness scale - Second Edition (SRS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), Post-test (week 20) and follow up (week 36) and long follow up (74 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be used as the parent's primary outcome.The Social Responsiveness Scale - Second Edition (SRS-2) School-Age Form is a 65-item rating scale, designed to measure social deficits in individuals with ASD via parent proxy report has been used as the primary outcome in a previous study evaluating KONTAKT and has been used as the basis for the power calculation for the present RCT. The SRS-2 (2014) enables calculation of a universal score and five treatment subscales: social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and restricted interests and repetitive behaviour. These subscales are designed to align closely with the DSM-5 criteria for ASD. The scale takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete with items scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale, ranging from &quot;not true (0)&quot; to &quot;almost always true (3)&quot;. The expected value for individuals with a primary diagnosis of ASD is approximately 100.</description>

The responses from each participant will then be marked by the scoring procedure proposed by O'hare and colleagues (2009). Based on this procedure, the scoring starts from &quot;0&quot; (incorrect answer or not answering) to &quot;2&quot; (full answer). The higher score indicates a better outcome on this measure.</description>
