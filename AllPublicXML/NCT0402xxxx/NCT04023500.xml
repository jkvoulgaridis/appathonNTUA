  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential additive effect of Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) on gingival health and self-care. Our hypothesis was that the Motivational
      Interviewing would result in improved gingival health and self-care compared to prevailing
      patient education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial of 6-month
      duration involving patients with diagnosed periodontitis. The subjects are randomized to
      intervention or control group using the randomizing list.

      For both groups, necessary non-surgical periodontal treatments will be done. In the
      intervention group The MI-intervention is used as a part of normal dental hygienist
      appointment and if patient need more than one visit, MI was used in every visit.

      In control group prevailing, more professional-centered education is used. Dental hygienist
      define patients educational needs and give direct instructions how to change behaviour and
      self-care.

    <description>Change in BoP is measured three times during the study. In the baseline and in the tree- and six-months follow-up.
Bop is recorded60 seconds after the pocket probing and assessed as present (1) or absent (0) on four surfaces.</description>

    <description>The MI-intervention is used as a part of normal dental hygienist appointment. Dental hygienists are trained to focus on patients view of their oral health, self-care skills and need for oral-health related behaviour change. They are supposed to use open-ended questions, reflective listening and reinforcing with patients. Dental hygienist support patients in decision making although patients were addressed as an active agent.</description>
