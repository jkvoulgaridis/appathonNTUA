  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the affects of an estradiol hemihydrate transdermal system on bone
      health in 24 adolescent females aged 12-19 years old with anorexia nervosa. Participants in
      this study will be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups. One group will receive treatment with a
      transdermal estrogen patch and the other group will not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no therapy exists to improve bone health in females with anorexia nervosa (AN)
      other than improving body mass. Transdermal estrogen is being investigated as to whether it
      has benefit to bone health parameters.

      While numerous studies have sought to orally replace estrogen in adolescents and women with
      AN, the replacement therapy suppresses IGF-1, and as a result oral estrogen studies have
      demonstrated no bone health benefit in AN. However, transdermal physiologic estrogen, due to
      no first-pass metabolism in the liver, is not IGF-1 suppressive. IGF-1 is known to be hormone
      that directly affects bone formation and is considered to be osteoanabolic (helps increase
      bone mass).

    <description>Participants randomized to the treatment arm will be divided by maturational status:
Participants who have had their first period or have a bone age greater than or equal to 14 years will receive PrClimara® 25 (estradiol hemihydrate transdermal system - 25 mcg/day) as a weekly patch, for 24 months.
o These participants will also receive progesterone (Provera 10 mg tablet) orally every 4 weeks, for 7 days during the second half of the planned menstrual cycle, in order to induce a menstrual period.
Participants who have not yet had their first period and have a bone age below 14 years will receive an increasing dose of estrogen. These participants will be initiated on graduated dose of transdermal 17-β estradiol patches:
3.1 mcg/day (1/8 patch) for first six-months,
6.2 mcg/day (1/4 patch) for second six-months,
12.5 mcg/day (1/2 patch) for third six-months, and
25 mcg/day (full patch) for final six-months.</description>
