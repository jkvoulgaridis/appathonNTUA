  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many years of clinical practice experience has found that Ruyi treasure pill can be used to
      treat nerve meridian injury caused by cerebrovascular disease, but in the end, the clinical
      efficacy is still lacking systematic clinical evidence-based medical research data. Based on
      this, the clinical observation of Ruyi treasure pill in the treatment of post-stroke motor
      and sensory dysfunction was carried out to verify its clinical location, to provide evidence
      for the application of clinical subdivision of later products and two development of
      products, and to publish academic papers on the expected research results.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor function change</measure>
    <time_frame>The simplified Fugl-Meyer motion function scale will be tested totally twice,separately at before taking drugs, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after taking drugs so as to compare changes among three time points.</time_frame>
    <description>Using Simplified Fugl-Meyer motion function assessment method to assess the motor function of affected side.The total score of Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment scale is 100 points，50 items intotal with 2 points each. Accordding to the quality of mission completion，evaluater mark score of &quot;0&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,2&quot;.Among them, 33 items are evaluated for upper limbs, with a total score of 66 points. And 17 items are evaluated for lower limbs,with a total score of 34 points.The higher the scores, the better motor function.If the total score is less than 50, it means severe dyskinesia.If the total score is between 50-84, it means obvious movement disorder.If the total score is between 85-95, it means moderate dyskinesia.If the total score is between 96-100, it means mild dyskinesia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory function change</measure>
    <time_frame>Simplified Fugl-Meyer sensory function scale will be tested before taking drugs, 4 weeks and 8weeks after taking drugs so as to compare changes at three time points.Three times in total.</time_frame>
    <description>Using Simplified Fugl-Meyer sensory function assessment scale to assess the sensory function of affected side,which includes light touch and proprioception. Light touch includes 4 parts, which are respectively upper arm, palm, thigh, foot. Proprioception includes 7 parts,which are respectively shoulder, elbow, wrist, thumb, knee, ankle, toe joint. The total score of each part is 2,the total scores of this scale is 22.&quot;0&quot; score means no feeling，&quot;1&quot; score means feeling allergic or diminished，&quot;2&quot;scores means normal feeling.The sum of the scores of each part is the total score. The higher the total scores,the better the sensory function.</description>

    <measure>Activity of daily living(ADL)change</measure>
    <time_frame>Modified Barthel Index will be tested before taking drugs, 4 weeks and 8weeks after taking drugs.Three times in total.</time_frame>
    <description>Using Modified Barthel Index to assess the activity of daily living. TheMBI scale includes 11 items with total scores of 100. Evaluation is based on the actual situation of the patient.The sum of the scores of each item is the total score,and the lowest score is&quot;0&quot;,the highest scores is&quot;100&quot;.If the scores is between 0-20 points,it means extremely severe dysfunction.If the scores is between 25-45 points,it means severe dysfunction.If the scores is between 50-70 points it means moderate functional defects.If the scores is between 75-95 points,it means mild functional defects.If the scores is 100 points,it means ADL self-care.The higher the total scores,the better the ADL.</description>

    <measure>Survival Quality Score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Special scale of quality of life will be tested before taking drugs, 4 weeks and 8weeks after taking drugs so as to compare changes at three time points.Three times in total.</time_frame>
    <description>Special scale of quality of life is used to test the survival quality this week. 3 selected questions are evalusted and there are 5 selections for each question. &quot;1&quot; means &quot;Exactly&quot;，&quot;2&quot; means &quot;Basically&quot;，&quot;3&quot;means &quot;Not sure&quot;，&quot;4&quot;means &quot;Basically not&quot;，&quot;5&quot;means &quot;Absolutely not&quot;.The sum of the scores of each question is the total score. The higher the total scores,the better the survival quality.</description>
