  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b dose-finding study of FT516 as monotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) and in combination with CD20 directed monoclonal antibodies in B-cell lymphoma. The
      study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage where participants will
      be enrolled into indication-sepcific cohorts.
