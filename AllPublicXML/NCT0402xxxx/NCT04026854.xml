  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological well-being at work is a major public health issue. The number of sick leave in
      hospitals has increased by 10% in five years and the average cost of absenteeism is around
      3000 euros per agent per year. These changes are associated with the increase in turnover
      among nurses, thus raising the question of its impact on the quality of care. Psychological
      suffering at work is one of the main determinants of intention to leave for nurses. We
      hypothesize that an improvement in the quality of work life of nurses could lead to greater
      loyalty, greater motivation of nurses and greater attractiveness within the community.
      'institution. Among the works on psychological well-being at work, few have been interested
      in the structural aspects of the organization of care and in particular to the variables
      specific to the caregivers themselves, such as the quality of life at work. Nevertheless,
      studies carried out in industry show significant and positive links between quality of life
      at work and performance at work. Thus, it seems appropriate to identify the factors likely to
      lead to an improvement in the quality of work life of psychiatric nurses and to determine the
      elements that can help to strengthen it. Moreover, it appears that the field of psychiatry
      could constitute an ideal field of experimentation. Psychiatry teams treat patients with
      chronic, severe and debilitating conditions, which are subject to significant social
      stigmatization, and expose nurses to a high rate of burnout. The organization of psychiatric
      care is also multidisciplinary. The various care procedures allow caregivers to carry out
      activities that include more or less significant participation in decision-making. Also,
      studying the determinants of the quality of working life among psychiatric nurses seems to us
      an important goal in order to put in place actions to strengthen psychological well-being at
      work, and thus to reduce turn-over and improve the quality of care.

      care delivered to patients.

      Study the effects of a change in the quality of work life of nurses on turnover.

    <description>The quality of work life of nurses as measured by the French version of the quality of life at work scale of Elizur and Shye (1990). This scale assesses four dimensions of quality of life at work. It has 16 items that can be answered using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very little) to 6 (mostly). The higher the score, the better the quality of life at work.</description>
