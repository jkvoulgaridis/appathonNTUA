  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this consecutive series PMCF study is to collect data confirming safety,
      performance and clinical benefits of the M/L Taper with Kinectiv Technology Stems and Necks
      when used for primary or revision total hip arthroplasty (implants) at 1,2,5 and 10-year
      follow-up*. ML Taper with Kinectiv Technology has been on the market since 2008, but has
      insufficient long term clinical data. Therefore, a prospective aspect to the study will be
      necessary to reach the 10-year time point.

      The objective of this consecutive series PMCF study is to collect data confirming safety,
      performance and clinical benefits of the M/L Taper with Kinectiv Technology Stems and Necks
      when used for primary or revision total hip arthroplasty (implants) at 1,2,5 and 10-year
      follow-up*. ML Taper with Kinectiv Technology has been on the market since 2008, but has
      insufficient long term clinical data. Therefore, a prospective aspect to the study will be
      necessary to reach the 10-year time point.

      The primary objective is to confirm safety of the study products. This will be assessed by
      recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.
      Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by analyzing
      recorded patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

      *Follow-up with the patient at the 10 year time point will be collected by the site
      prospectively and the 1, 2 and 5 year time point data will be collected by the sponsor
      retrospectively from an existing database including ML Taper with Kinectiv Technology
      patients from a Zimmer Biomet hip registry.

This will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.

    <measure>Device safety assessed through radiographic assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Out to 10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of the device by reviewing radiographic data post implantation for each patient. A radiograph will be taken at each follow-up time point and reviewed by the surgeon to assess the frequency and incidence of any device related issues that may show up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Performance and Benefits evaluated through the Harris Hip Score outcome measure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Out to 10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The HHS is divided into 4 sub-categories; pain (44 points), function (47 points), range of motion (5 points), and absence of deformity (4 points). Patients select a discrete set of answers which correspond to predefined point allocations based on the category. To obtain a final score, these values are summed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Performance and Benefits evaluated through the EuroQolo Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ5D) outcome measure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Out to 10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D measures 5 dimensions of general health; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, with a total of 5 questions. It is accompanied by the patient's self-assessment with the VAS. There are three versions of the EQ-5D; 3 level (3L), 5 level (5L), and a youth (Y) version based off of the 3L model.
Each dimension is assigned one of three discrete levels for evaluation on the day of administration for the three level evaluation:
Level 1 - No problems, no disability Level 2 - Some problems, moderate disability Level 3 - A lot of problems, severe disability
The final score is a five digit composite of the responses ranging between 33333 - 11111 with 243 possible combinations in between for the 3L test. The 5L test can measure 3,125 different health states and ranges between 55555-11111.</description>
