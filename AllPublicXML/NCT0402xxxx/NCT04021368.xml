    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study will evaluate SEL120, a novel small molecule CDK8/19 inhibitor, in
      patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (HR-MDS), in
      terms of selection of the recommended dose for further clinical development and assessment of
      safety, tolerability, preliminary anti-leukemic activity, as well as pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic profiles.

             time-period.

         11. For males, an effective barrier method of contraception must be used during study
             participation until 90 days after the last dose of study drug, if the patient is
             sexually active with a FCBP. Males must also refrain from donating blood or sperm
             during the same time-period.

         12. Investigator considers the patient to be suitable for participation in the clinical
             study by assessing that they:

               -  Can comply with study medication dosing requirements and all study-related
                  procedures and evaluations; and

             of the disease for 5 years or more prior to Screening. Exceptions to the ≥5-year time
