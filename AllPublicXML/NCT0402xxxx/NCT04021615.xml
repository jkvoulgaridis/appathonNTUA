      Statement of the problem:

      Are there any differences between comprehensive rehabilitation program consisted of
      (peripheral muscle training and functional training) combined with inspiratory muscle
      training and traditional chest physical therapy consisted of (percussion, mechanical
      vibration, positioning and modified postural drainage) combined with inspiratory muscle
      training on weaning from mechanical ventilation as a primary outcome, respiratory muscle
      strength, peripheral muscle strength and functional status in difficult and prolonged weaning
      from mechanical ventilation as secondary outcomes?

      Purpose of the study:

      The aim of the present study will be to compare between the effect of comprehensive
      rehabilitation program combined with inspiratory muscle training and traditional chest
      physical therapy combined with inspiratory muscle training on weaning from mechanical
      ventilation as a primary outcome, inspiratory muscle strength, peripheral muscle strength,
      functional status as secondary outcomes.

      Significance of the study Survival of critically ill patients has increased as a result of
      medical technology and interdisciplinary team cooperation.

      Functional losses , reduced quality of life and survival , and increased healthcare costs are
      consequences of prolonged immobility in ICU.

      The European Respiratory Society and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine task force
      has recommended a hierarchy of ICU mobilization based on progressively increasing exercise
      intensity; decubitus change and functional positioning , passive mobilization , active-
      assisted and active exertion , cycloegonometry in bed , sitting in bed orthostatism , static
      walking , transferring from bed to chair, chair exertion and walking.

      Failure to wean may have different etiologies such as underlying severe respiratory disease,
      respiratory muscle dysfunction , metabolic and endocrine disorders and cognitive dysfunction.
      Peripheral and respiratory muscles dysfunction is a consequence of prolonged mechanical
      ventilation and ICU- acquired weakness. Weaning from mechanical ventilator should be
      considered to be as early as possible to avoid complications caused by absence of spontaneous
      breathing and further muscles atrophy.

      Targeted mobility therapy (TMT) , simulating comprehensive rehabilitation program that will
      be used in the present study, is a novel strategy for managing critically ill patients . This
      concept will work as a scientifically- driven, dynamic bundle of rehabilitation intervention
      that include inspiratory muscle strength training , bronchial hygiene , and active
      mobilization . This concept will guarantee the bet outcomes for critically ill patients with
      difficult and prolonged weaning as regards weaning success , days on mechanical ventilator ,
      length of hospital stay and functional mobility.

    <description>Spontaneous breathing trials will be used when underlying cause of acute respiratory failure stabilizes or significantly improves and daily assessment of the patient's readiness for ventilator discontinuation is considered. The spontaneous breathing trial will last from 30 minutes to 120 minutes combined with CPAP and if the trial had failed, the patient will be returned back to full ventilatory support for at least 24 hours before performing a new trial Weaning success is defined as extubation and the absence of ventilatory support 48 hous following extubation</description>

    <description>The mechanical ventilator will be used to measure the plateau pressure (maximal inspiratory pressure). Plateau pressure was measured using the inspiratory hold function on the venilator while the patient will be sedated and on volume control mode (Sidebotham et al., 2007) The plateau pressure will be measured by ventilator in millibar then it converted to cm o by multiplying it by 1.01971621298 (1millibar equals 1.01971621298 cm 0) and near the figure to the nearest two decimal places</description>

    <description>Upper and lower extremity muscle strength will be assessed using a handheld dynamometer. The shoulder flexor, elbow flexor, and knee extensor muscle groups w ill be included in the measurements. Standard test positions will be modified because all patients in this study are using mechanical ventilator and unable to sit up at initial examination. The shoulder and elbow flexors will be tested in the semi-Fowler position. The isometric force of the shoulder flexors will be tested with the shoulder flexed 90 degrees and the elbow in extended position. The dynamometer will be placed just proximal to the epicondyles of the humerus, and the patients will be stabilized at the axillary region. The isometric force of the elbow flexors will be tested with the elbow flexed 90 degrees, the forearm supinated, and the shoulder in neutral position; the dynamometer will be placed just proximal to styloid processes of ulna and radius, and the patients will be stabilized at the superior aspect of</description>

    <description>A threshold inspiratory muscle trainer will be connected to the artificial airway with 15 mm and 22 mm adaptors. Training bouts consist of three to five sets of six repetitions breathing through the trainer. Training will be conducted with the patient in bed with an approximately 30Â° head-up tilt and with intensity about 40 %- 50 % of maximal inspiratory pressure. Patients will be returned to mechanical ventilation for rest between training sets as needed. Three to five sets of six training breaths will be completed for a total of 18 to 30 training breaths per session. Following each training set, the patient indicated a rating of perceived inspiratory exertion on modified Borg scale . The study group will also receive comprehensive rehabilitation program consist of upper-extremity exercises, lower extremity exercises, pedaling exercises, trunk control exercises and bedside functional training</description>
