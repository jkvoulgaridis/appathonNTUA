  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmune system which attacks the central nervous
      system and that is one of the most common inflammatory diseases and has caused a heavy
      disease burden on patients. In the world, the prevalence of MS is on the rise, and the annual
      growth rate of MS patients in Taiwan is much higher than the whole world (3.78 times).
      However, it has no discussion or study in references at present, and it is worthwhile to
      research. MS is not a fatal disease, but its complications make the mortality of its patients
      three times higher than that of general population. This study will explore the survival and
      the causes of death for MS patients in Taiwan by cohort study of fourteen years. In addition,
      in the recent years, the MS patients in Taiwan and the medical resource consumption has
      increased largely, and it is necessary to conduct the research.

      The study population is based on the 'National Health Insurance Research Database' (NHIRD)
      from 2001 to 2015 provided by Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare. The subjects are
      diagnosed as MS patients based on the 'Registry for Catastrophic Illness'. First, the
      investigators will perform the statistical analysis of the incidence, the prevalence, the
      mortality and the trend analysis of the MS patients diagnosed each year. First, Kaplan-Meier
      method will be employed to examine the survival curves. Next, Cox proportional hazards model
      will be used to analyze the survival and related factors. Last, multiple regression analysis
      will be then performed to analyze the influence of independent variables on patients' medical
      utilization in each year.

      In response to the lack of data on population-based epidemiological studies on MS diseases in
      Asia, this research wishes to fill the gaps in the studies of global prevention and analyze
      the patient's survival, mortality risk factors and the medical utilization as a reference for
      national health policies.
