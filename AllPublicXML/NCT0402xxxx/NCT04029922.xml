  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, first in human, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study of
      MT-5111 (a recombinant fusion protein) in subjects with HER2-positive solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two sequential parts:

        -  Part 1 (Dose Escalation): The purpose of Part 1 is to determine the Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
           to be used in Part 2. Part 1 will include any type of HER2-positive solid cancer.

        -  Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The purpose of Part 2 is to confirm the safety and tolerability
           of the RP2D of MT-5111. Part 2 will include any type of HER2-positive solid cancer,
           including breast cancer, gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEA).

      Up to 140 eligible subjects will be identified and treated through competitive enrollment at
      multiple study centers.

      In Parts 1 and 2 of the study, a subject may participate for the following four periods:

        -  Screening (up to 28 days before first dose of MT-5111)

        -  Treatment period (active period where a subject will receive doses of MT-5111 over a
           21-day treatment cycle)

        -  Follow-up (30 days after last dose of MT-5111)

        -  Long-term follow-up (up to 24 months after the last dose of MT-5111)

      MT-5111 will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion over about 30 minutes on the same day
      every week (i.e., on day 1, day 8 and day 15 of each cycle, a cycle being defined as 21
      days). A subject can continue receiving MT-5111 as long as it is well-tolerated, their
      disease has not worsened, or until the subject decides they no longer want to participate in
      the study.
