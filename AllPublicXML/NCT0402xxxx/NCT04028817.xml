  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of photobiomodulation in the treatment of patients with
      Parkinson's disease. Half of participants will receive treatment with low level laser therapy
      and exercises in combination, while the other half will receive a placebo laser combined with
      exercises.

    <measure>10-meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This evaluation will be carried out from the application of the tem meter walk test. The test will be performed in a straight hall, with a line 14 meters long. The first 2 meters marked, will be provided so that the patient reaches the usual walking speed, and the last 2 meters will be provided for the patient to decelerate and stop. At the start of the test, patients will receive walking guidance at a comfortable pace.</description>
