    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and evaluate Link for Equity, a trauma-informed system
      of care. Link, a system of support for ACE-affected children, is composed of universal school
      Trauma-Informed Care. Preventing Racism through Awareness and Action (PRAA) is a
      perspective-taking racism/discrimination prevention intervention for school staff that
      increases awareness of racism and how it impacts students and promotes empathy for students
      of color. Link for Equity will be translated to be culturally responsive for 12 secondary
      public schools in metropolitan and rural Minnesota with substantial racial/ethnic minority
      students and racial/ethnic disparities in school discipline and violence. Using a nested,
      rigorous, and ethically acceptable randomized waitlist control design, the investigators will
      implement and evaluate Link for Equity sequentially for two years in each school. The overall
      goal is to evaluate if Link for Equity can reduce school violence disparities.

      Significance of Research Question/Purpose: Youth violence is an emergent nationwide public
      health issue. Almost two-thirds of public schools across America report one or more violent
      incidents on their campus annually. In 2014, approximately 850,000 non-fatal victimizations
      occurred among 12-18 year-old students; this includes 486,400 assaults and serious violent
      victimizations. About 22% of children in the U.S. reported being bullied at school in 2011,
      and one in 10 students report being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in
      the past year.

      Racial/ethnic minority youth are at increased risk for school violence. African American,
      Latino, and American Indian youth report higher rates of in-school physical fighting, weapon
      carrying, and gang presence compared to white youth. The highest rates of severe violence are
      reported in urban high schools with high minority enrollment, and large samples and reviews
      indicate Black and Latino youth engage in more bullying than other racial groups.

      Accumulation of adverse child experiences (ACEs), or childhood traumas such as abuse,
      neglect, household dysfunction, and racial discrimination, place children at high risk for
      violent behaviors. Multiple ACEs are more prevalent among American Indian (40%), Hispanic
      (31%) and black children (33%) compared with white children (21%). ACEs have acute and
      cumulative detrimental impacts on the physiological, cognitive, behavioral and psychological
      health of children, and children with increased ACEs are more likely to engage in violent
      behaviors at school.

      For example, the Olweus Anti-bullying Program, which was shown to be effective in Norway yet
      ineffective among Washington's racial/ethnic minority students, is implemented widely. A
      number of gaps in addressing risks for youth violence remain. Many programs are limited to
      didactic instruction in the classroom, or solely target children with significant behavioral
      concerns. Systems-based approaches are the most promising sustainable models because they
      capitalize on infrastructures and services offered at school. This study will evaluate a
      systems-based model, Link for Equity. Link is combines Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) and
      psychological first aid in a culturally sensitive manner. Link for Equity offers cultural
      humility training that specifically targets racial/ethnic microaggressions to prevent racial
      discrimination in discipline referrals of racial and ethnic minority students.

      The aims are to:

      Aim 1: Adapt, implement, and measure the effect of Link for Equity on school violence
      disparities.

      Aim 2: Measure the effect of Link for Equity on racial discrimination by teachers (2a), and
      assess if teachers' racial discrimination mediates the effect of Link for Equity on school
      violence (2b).

      Aim 3: Explore connectedness and stress mechanisms through which Link for Equity impacts
      school violence disparities.

    <measure>Change in School-based Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (SbREMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 14-item scale that measures microaggressions that communicate perceptions of academic inferiority, expectations of aggression, and stereotypical misrepresentations. Respondents are instructed to indicate the number of times that a microaggression occurred in the past month from 1 (never) to 3 (regularly). Sub-scales include Academic Inferiority Microaggressions, Expectations of Aggression Microaggressions, and Stereotypical Misrepresentations Microaggressions. Items are averaged to obtain total and sub-scale scores. Higher scores indicate greater perceived frequency of racial microaggressions. Change in SbREMS score from baseline to two years post will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>The Interventionist will use motivational interviewing skills, assess ethnic and racial microaggressions, and provide support, screen for posttraumatic stress, and, if appropriate, link student to advanced care. The student may meet with the Interventionist several times during the remainder of the school year. These meetings will be approximately 10-30 minutes in length and occur during the school day in a private location determined by the Interventionist. The student may be referred to additional resources as a result of the meetings. The meetings will be documented by the Interventionist using a case management system (in RedCap).</description>

    <description>In order to compare outcomes contemporaneously, students from waitlisted schools will be asked to complete baseline and follow-up surveys, which will be collected at approximately the same time as in the immediate intervention schools. The data will be captured for analysis at the end of the study. Students will complete intervention following the waitlist period.</description>
