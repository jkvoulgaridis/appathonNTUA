  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

      Mindsets have been rigorously studied in the domains of development, education, and more
      recently, in health and disease. However, there are no large-scale longitudinal studies of
      the mindsets held by cancer patients and how they may affect treatment outcomes, physical
      health, and psychological well-being. This randomized, single-blind, treatment-as-usual (TAU)
      control study aims to assess (1) mindsets at four time points spanning from the point of
      diagnosis to six weeks post-treatment to patients who are newly diagnosed with cancer and
      undergoing treatment with curative intent, and (2) the impact of a brief but targeted mindset
      intervention to help instill more useful mindsets about the nature of cancer and the role of
      the body on patient reported measures of physical and psychological health. This study aims
      to add to the existing literature on psychosocial interventions for cancer patients and
      survivors while addressing the substantial time and cost limitations of traditional
      interventions. It also contributes to the body of research indicating that mindsets play an
      important role in both health and wellbeing.

      Secondary Objectives:

      This study has two secondary objectives. First, we aim to determine the impact of patient
      mindsets on measures of treatment (treatment efficacy and treatment related adverse events)
      and psychosocial health (stress, coping, mood, emotions). Second, we aim to understand the
      relationship between patient mindsets and biomarkers of immune and inflammatory processes in
      patients undergoing cancer treatment

    <measure>Quality of Life Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), a widely used patient reported health outcome measure. The FACT-G consists of 27 questions. Each question is answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores on the FACT-G indicate better quality of life. Questions fall into four subscales measuring four domains of quality of life: physical wellbeing (7 questions), social/family well-being (7 questions), emotional well-being (6 questions), and functional well-being (7-questions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring mindsets</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient mindsets will be measured using the Illness Mindset Inventory (IMI). The IMI is a 20-item measure of mindsets about chronic illness. The Cancer version of the IMI consists of two subscales: mindsets about the nature of cancer and mindsets about the role of the body. Each item is rated on a 6 point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Cancer Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of Cancer Recurrence will be measured using the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS). The CWS is a 6-item measure that assesses worry about the risk of developing cancer in cancer survivors. All items use a 4-point scale of frequency, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (almost all the time). The CWS will be measured at only one time-point (CP-7), 6 weeks after the completion of treatment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker Analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be analyzed for the following biomarkers of interest.
C-reactive protein (CRP)
-6 / Interleukin (IL) IL-8
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring stress with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This 10-item measure is the most commonly used measure of perceptions of stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring coping with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Coping will be measured using the Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI). The CBI is a 27-item measure of self-efficacy for coping with cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring affect with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Affect will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The PANAS is a 20 item scale measuring positive and negative affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measuring emotional regulation with cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion Regulation will be measured using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The ERQ is a 10-item self-report scale designed to measure use of strategies to alter emotion: reappraisal of cognitions and suppression of expressions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will only recruit patients â‰¥ 18 years who are fluent in English and are without
             cognitive impairment. We have no gender, race, or ethnicity restrictions. Diagnosis of
             cancer (breast, lung, GI or colorectal, or lymphoma) and treatment given with curative
             intent.

          -  Patients diagnosed with lung cancer, breast cancer, GI/Colorectal cancer, or Lymphoma
             to be treated with curative intent will be eligible for this study.

          -  Participants will be recruited if they are receiving at least one course of systemic
             treatment. As we are recruiting participants near the point of diagnosis, we will
             target individuals who have not received prior therapy for cancer.

          -  Neither ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Status will be employed

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document is
             required for participation in this study.

          -  Treatment plan includes course of systemic treatment involving no less than 4 and no
             more than 12 infusions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgical procedures, if applicable, must take place either before the initiation of
             systemic treatment or after the last infusion.

          -  There are no restrictions regarding the use of other investigational agents; however,
             use of any investigational agents will be recorded.

          -  No active major mental health diagnoses including severe depression, severe anxiety,
             bipolar / manic depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or
             any psychotic disorder. Patients with mild depression or anxiety, or depression or
             anxiety that is well managed with treatment, will not be excluded

          -  Pregnant / nursing patients will not be excluded from the study

          -  Patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer (cancer survivors) will be excluded from
             this study. Cancer survivors may already have preconceived notions about the nature of
             a cancer diagnosis and the course of treatment, and therefore may not respond to our
             intervention in the same way as individuals who are encountering a cancer diagnosis
             for the first time.

          -  Patients who are HIV-positive will not be excluded.

          -  Patients who have major comorbidities that would substantially reduce life expectancy
             despite successful cancer treatment (i.e., comorbid end stage heart disease or kidney
             disease) will be excluded from this study.
