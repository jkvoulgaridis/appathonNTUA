      A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Bermekimab in Patients With Moderate to Severe
      Atopic Dermatitis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of bermekimab in
      patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The primary objective of the study is to
      analyze the safety and efficacy of different dose regimens of bermekimab compared to placebo
      treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The study is multicenter and will
      consist of three groups:

      Treatment Arm 1: Bermekimab every week (qw)

      Treatment Arm 2: Bermekimab every other week (q2w)

      Arm 3 (Placebo): Placebo every week (qw)

    <measure>Proportion of patients with EASI-75 (≥75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score [EASI]) from baseline at week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a score of 0 to 6. The EASI assessment tool is provided in the Study Reference Manual.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with ≥4-point improvement (reduction) in the weekly average peak daily Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score from baseline at week 16 in patients with baseline score ≥4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during a daily recall period using a study diary. Patients will be asked to complete the following question:
• For maximum itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with ≥4-point improvement (reduction) in the weekly average overall Pruritus Numeric Rating (NRS) from baseline at week 16 in patients with baseline score ≥4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during a daily recall period using a study diary. Patients will be asked to complete the following questions:
• For average itch intensity: &quot;On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your itch overall (on average) during the previous 24 hours?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with ≥4-point improvement (reduction) in the weekly average Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score from baseline at week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a unidimensional 11-point measure of pain intensity in adults. Patients will be given a diary to complete each night before bed, in which they will select a number from 0-10 (0 = no pain , and 10 = worst imaginable pain&quot;) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. Patient diaries will be collected and responses will be assessed weekly until study completion.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with a Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 and a reduction in this measure of at least 2 points at week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA is provided in the study reference manual.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with EASI-90 (≥90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score [EASI] from baseline) at week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a score of 0 to 6.

    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) from baseline to week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QOL. The format is a simple response (0 to 3 where 0 is &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 is &quot;very much&quot;) to 10 questions, which assess QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QOL. The DLQI is provided in the study reference manual.</description>

             least 3, based on the average of daily pruritis numerical rating scale scores for
             maximum itch intensity reported during the 7 days prior to randomization.

          -  Has applied a stable dose of topical moisturizer twice daily for at least 7
             consecutive days immediately prior to the baseline visit and is willing to continue
             this regimen on a daily basis for the duration of the study.

          -  ≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at screening and baseline visits.

          -  Documented recent history (within 6 months prior to screening) of inadequate response
             to treatment with topical medications, or patients for whom topical treatments are
             medically inadvisable (because of important side effects or safety risks).

               1. Inadequate response is defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or a
                  low disease activity state (comparable to an IGA score of 0-2), despite treatment
                  with a daily regimen of topical corticosteroids of medium to higher potency (with
                  or without topical calcineurin inhibitors as appropriate), applied for at least
                  28 days or for the maximum duration recommended by the product prescribing
                  information, whichever is shorter.

               2. Patients with documented systemic treatment for atopic dermatitis in the
                  preceding 6 months are also considered to be inadequate responders to topical
                  treatments and are potentially eligible for treatment with MABp1, after
                  appropriate washout.

               3. Important side effects or risks are those that outweigh the potential treatment
                  benefits, and include: intolerance to treatment, hypersensitivity reactions,
                  significant skin atrophy, and adverse systemic effects.

               4. Acceptable documentation includes contemporaneous chart notes that record topical
                  medication prescription and treatment outcome, or investigator documentation
                  based on communication with the patient's treating physician.

             antibody at the screening visit

          -  At baseline, presence of any conditions listed as criteria for study drug
             discontinuation

          -  Presence of skin comorbidities that may interfere with study assessments

          -  Severe concomitant illness(es) that, in the investigator's judgment, would adversely
             affect the patient's participation in the study. Examples include, but are not limited
             to, patients with short life expectancy, patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c ≥
             9%), patients with cardiovascular conditions (eg, stage III or IV cardiac failure
             according to the New York Heart Association classification), severe renal conditions
             (eg, patients on dialysis), hepato-biliary conditions (eg, Child-Pugh class B or C),
             neurological conditions (eg, demyelinating diseases), active major autoimmune diseases
             (eg, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), other severe
             endocrinological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, pulmonary or lymphatic diseases. The
             specific justification for patients excluded under this criterion will be noted in
             study documents (chart notes, case report forms [CRFs], etc.)

             during the study

          -  Women unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential and
             sexually active. Adequate birth control is defined as consistent practice of an
             effective and accepted method of contraception throughout the duration of the study
             and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug. These methods include hormonal
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, double barrier contraception (ie, condom +
             diaphragm), or male partner with a documented vasectomy.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Any other medical or psychological condition (including relevant laboratory
             abnormalities at screening) that, in the opinion the investigator, may suggest a new
             and/or insufficiently understood disease, may present an unreasonable risk to the
             study patient as a result of his/her participation in the study, may make patient's
             participation unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments. The specific
             justification for patients excluded under this criterion will be noted in study
             documents (chart notes, case report forms, etc.)
