    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profiles, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of oral abexinostat monotherapy in
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed standard of care, and thereby to
      determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the oral monotherapy of abexinostat.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profiles, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of oral abexinostat monotherapy in
      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed standard of care, and thereby to
      determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the oral monotherapy of abexinostat.

      Three (3) dose groups are pre-set to include 40 mg BID, 60 mg BID and 80 mg
      BID,respectively.The pre-set dose group is subject to change during the study and the actual
      dosage increment is determined by the Data safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). A total of
      12-16 subjects in the RP2D dose group will be required to accept PK blood sampling for the
      analysis of PK profiles and parameters. The patients will continue treatment until the
      occurrence of a DLT event, disease progression, intolerant toxicity, withdrawal of ICF,
      treatment discontinuation determined by the investigator, lost to follow-up, death, or
      termination of the study, (whichever occurs first).
