  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased activity in the hippocampus (i.e. hyperactivity) during a memory task in the
      magnetic resonance (MR) scanner was found both in healthy elderly participants as well as in
      patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a prodromal of Alzheimer's disease).
      Additionally, individuals with increased hippocampal activity showed elevated amyloid-ß load
      over time, accompanied with an increased progression rate to Alzheimer's disease. Reducing
      hippocampal hyperactivity with pharmacological treatment improved memory functions in
      patients with MCI. The investigators will apply real-time fMRI based neurofeedback to
      downregulate hippocampal activity and thereby test if this is beneficial for memory
      functions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is an insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disease
      accompanied by extracellular deposits of beta-amyloids (⁠aβ) and the increase of cognitive
      dysfunctions. Several functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in the prodromal
      stage of AD have found increased hippocampal activity during a memory task to be predictive
      of memory worsening and disease progression. In this study the investigators are aiming to
      reduce hippocampal hyperactivity with real-time functional magnet resonance imaging (rtfMRI)
      based neurofeedback.

      This study will use a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded parallel
      group design. Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy participants will be
      assigned to receive rtfMRI from either the hippocampus (experimental group, N=40) or from
      another brain area (alternate region of interest (ROI) feedback group, N=40). All
      participants will be instructed to downregulate their hippocampal activity to a target level.
