  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, researchers want to gain more information on children suffering
      from abnormal stomach and intestine function (based on the Rome criteria) and treated
      Iberogast. The Rome criteria have been developed by experts to support doctors to diagnose
      stomach and intestine disorders. This study will focus on children aged from 3 to 14 years in
      age treated by their doctor with the herbal drug Iberogast for their stomach and intestine
      complaints for one week. Researcher want to learn more about the efficacy of Iberogast by
      observing the changes of symptoms related to the stomach and intestine disorders. In addition
      information on the safety of the drug and how well the drug is tolerated by the patients will
      be collected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptoms Profile (GIS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The score was developed by Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH in co-operation with a gastroenterological expert group and validated (Holtmann et al. 2004, Adam et al., 2005). It consists of 10 individual symptoms that were regarded as being typical for dyspepsia. They were evaluated based on a 5-stage Likert scale. The score was adapted to the special situation of children and adolescents with functional gastrointestinal disorders as part of the study concept. The change in the summary score during therapy serves as evaluation criterion for the efficacy of the therapeutic measure. The symptoms profile essentially involves all the symptoms of functional dyspepsia mentioned by the German Society for Gastrointestinal and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) or international Rome criteria. Its usability was confirmed by the validation procedure.</description>

        The selection of the children to be documented was the sole responsibility of the physician
        whereby the information of the Rome III criteria on functional gastrointestinal diseases in
        children as well as the prescribing information on Iberogast could be consulted as
        guideline. Only the therapeutic necessity was determining for the use of all medicines. The
        treating physicians received standardised information regarding the ailment picture (Rome
        III criteria) before the beginning of the study and during the investigator meetings.
