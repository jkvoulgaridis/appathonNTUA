  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of lasers to treat various problems in dentistry is growing as it has in medicine.
      One application is the use of lasers to treat periodontal disease. It has been suggested that
      the laser may reduce the need for surgical treatment by reducing pockets. The goal of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of laser treatment for periodontal disease. Laser
      therapy will be used in addition to traditional non-surgical scaling and root planing (deep
      cleaning). The information obtained from this study will provide an objective assessment of
      adjunctive laser therapy compared to conventional periodontal therapy and will attempt to
      show the benefits, if any, lasers can provide in the treatment of chronic periodontal
      disease.
