  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avicena is developing new non-invasive methods (hardware and software) for diagnosis of a
      variety of heart conditions. This study is designed to compare data obtained using Avicena's
      device, the Vivio, to data obtained from transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for the
      diagnosis of moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a disease of the
      valve (aortic valve) that separates the left ventricle of the heart from the aorta. When AS
      is severe, the heart cannot pump adequate amounts of blood into the arterial tree. AS is
      often silent until the disease is severe. This study compares a rapid test using Vivio to a
      longer and more expensive test that is the current gold standard for diagnosis of AS, TTE.

  <detailed_description>

      The study proposed here is a research study to develop the Vivio system for diagnosis of
      severe AS. The data gathered in this study will be used to optimize the Avicena software
      algorithm used to make the diagnosis of AS.

      The Vivio device is an optical-type tonometer that operates based on capturing the vibrations
      of the skin due to the arterial pulse pressure wave as it propagates through the underlying
      carotid vessel. When applied to the neck over the subject's carotid pulse, an arterial
      waveform (pressure tracing) and heart sounds are sensed, and sent to an iPad using Bluetooth,
      then sent to Avicena for analysis.

      After informed consent subjects will undergo a brief cardiac-focused history and examination.
      All subjects will have bilateral exams with the Vivio (~5 minutes each) conducted by a study
      doctor or nurse, and a standard clinical resting TTE conducted by a certified technician. The
      entire study visit should take 1.5 hours, and there is no follow up.

        Severe, symptomatic AS incidence increases with age, so that most patients do not
        experience symptoms until after age 60. For this reason, to enrich for the population of
        patients with potential AS, subjects over age 65 will be studied.
