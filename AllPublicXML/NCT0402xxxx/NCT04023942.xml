  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite standardized intervention strategies, weight loss and weight loss maintenance largely
      differ from person to person. Factors which may contribute to these individual differences is
      current object of research.

      In order to investigate predictors and barriers for weight management and to investigate two
      different dietary interventions and two different digital tools for weight maintenance, the
      LION-Study was designed as follows: Step I (screening, baseline phenotyping), step II (weight
      loss intervention with formula diet), step III (weight maintenance intervention with 4
      intervention groups: low carb/newsletter; low carb/app; low fat/newsletter; low fat/app) and
      step IV (follow-up). Participants are required to attend visits at seven time points.

      At screening (month 0) a telephone-based screening interview takes place, in order to test
      eligibility of the potential participant. If the person is eligible, two consecutive baseline
      face-to-face visits are planned during step I. After completion of the eight weeks weight
      loss intervention (month 3), an additional visit takes place followed by three consecutive
      visits in the weight maintenance step (month 6, 9 and 15). The study ends with a final visit
      after the follow-up (month 27). Additional contacts (face-to-face and telephone) take place
      during the weight loss intervention step. Participants will regularly receive a bag with the
      required formula diet meals. During these &quot;pick up&quot; appointments, the study team actively get
      in face-to-face contact with participants.

      At the different visits, data are collected by questionnaires, medical investigations (e.g.
      MRI, motor function, resting metabolic rate), blood withdrawal as well as urine, feces and
      saliva sampling.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the effect of two diets (low carb/low fat) and two digital
      tools (app/newsletter) on long-term weight loss maintenance 12 months after weight loss.

      Secondary objective is to identify genetic, epigenetic, physiological, psychological and
      lifestyle factors that predict the success of weight loss and weight loss maintenance.

      Step I - Screening and baseline phenotyping When a potential suitable participant is
      interested, a screening interview to check eligibility will take place by phone after oral
      agreement is given. The structured screening interview is carried out by means of a
      questionnaire in the format of a Case Report Form (CRF). Suitable persons are provided with
      participant´s information and data protection sheet and with the &quot;declaration of consent&quot;.
      Sufficient time for consideration is given between the screening interview and visit 1A,
      where written consent is signed.

      After the telephone-based screening interview, eligible participants are required to provide
      written consent. Participants will undergo clinical examinations at two visits (V1A + V1B),
      serving primarily for phenotyping as well as for detection of potentially unknown exclusion
      criteria. The order of some measurements carried out during V1A and V1B as well as the type
      of lipid challenge is randomized.

      Data collection V1A:

        -  Resting metabolic rate

        -  Metabolic response to meal challenge

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Blood parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Sampling of blood samples for further research questions

      Data collection V1B:

        -  Metabolic response to meal challenge

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Blood parameters

        -  Urine parameters

        -  Hand Strength Measurement

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Sampling of blood, urine and saliva

        -  Optional: Adipose tissue distribution by MRI measurement; parameters for physical
           strength, motor function and body static condition; 24h urine collection; fecal samples

      Step II - Weight loss intervention Once participant is still deemed eligible after V1A and
      V1B, the formula-based low calorie diet (LCD) starts as weight loss intervention. Formula
      products will be provided once per week. An additional daily intake of 200 g raw or cooked
      non-starchy vegetables is allowed. Participants fulfill a food diary to record eaten products
      including drinks and vegetables and to record well-being or side effects. Furthermore,
      participants are phenotyped by a continuous glucose measurement during the first four weeks
      of intervention.

      Data collection V2:

        -  Anthropometry

        -  Vital parameters

        -  Blood and urine parameters

        -  Clinical, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity), psychological, environmental and
           social factors (questionnaires and protocols)

        -  Resting metabolic rate

        -  Hand strength measurement

        -  Documentation of safety
