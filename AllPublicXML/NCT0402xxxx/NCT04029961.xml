  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an immersive virtual reality
      (VR)-based education program with the form of patient education commonly provided by clinics
      (e.g. an educational video) at delivering education to breast cancer patients as they prepare
      for radiation therapy treatment. Self-evaluation questionnaires completed by participants
      will be used to measure changes in informational needs and anxiety, stress, preparedness and
      satisfaction levels pre/post education between the VR-based education and video education
      groups in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 45 percent of breast cancer patients experience anxiety, potentially even
      reaching levels that are considered clinically-relevant. Prior research in this area has
      described the informational needs of breast cancer patients at different time points as they
      proceed through the radiotherapy treatment process. Of high importance seems to be addressing
      patients' informational needs through sensory and procedural information as a mechanism of
      anxiety reduction.

      The study team created an immersive VR-based education program that enables breast cancer
      patients to experience the procedure and emotions associated with radiation therapy prior to
      their actual treatment by offering controlled virtual exposure to the clinical environments
      involved in the treatment process. An educational video on the process of receiving radiation
      therapy is considered standard education at the majority of the clinical sites involved in
      this study.

      Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly assigned to either the VR-based
      education group or the video education group.

      Participation in this project will provide insight into aspects of patient education that are
      most effective at reducing anxiety and stress levels and meeting patients' informational
      needs when undergoing radiation therapy treatment.

    <time_frame>Directly pre/post education (education appointment), directly following first radiation therapy (RT) treatment (first RT appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI will be administered as a self-evaluation questionnaire at several time points. The STAI consists of two scales: one for measuring trait anxiety and one for measuring state anxiety. Both of the scales have ranges from 20 - 80, with higher scores representing higher anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Directly pre/post education (education appointment), directly following first radiation therapy treatment (first RT appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale for Stress will be administered as a self-evaluation questionnaire at several time points. Participants will indicate where they fall in terms of stress level from 0 (no stress at all) to 100 (most stressed ever).</description>

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale for Preparedness will be administered as a self-evaluation questionnaire at several time points. Participants will indicate where they fall in terms of preparedness for their RT treatment from 0 (not prepared at all) to 100 (completely prepared).</description>

    <time_frame>Directly pre/post education (education appointment), directly following first radiation therapy treatment (first RT appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale for Satisfaction will be administered at several time points. Participants will indicate where they fall in terms of satisfaction with the radiation oncology department from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 100 (completely satisfied).</description>

    <time_frame>Directly pre/post education (education appointment), directly following first radiation therapy treatment (first RT appointment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Informational Needs Scale will be administered as a self-evaluation questionnaire at several time points. Participants will indicate how important it is for them to have information on a set of items related to radiation therapy treatment from 1 (not important) to 9 (very important). Participants will also indicate whether they feel their needed level of information for each item has been met, partially met, or unmet.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is 18 years of age or older

          2. Patient is female

          3. Patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer

          4. Patient will be receiving whole breast radiation therapy without supraclavicular nodal
             irradiation

          5. Patient is scheduled for an outpatient radiation oncology visit

          6. Patient has the ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the
             willingness to sign it

          7. Patient has the ability to complete a series of self-reported questionnaires

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-English-speaking patients (as the VR education program includes English narration)

          2. Patients with visual defects that affect their ability to watch a movie

          3. Patients with auditory defects that affect their ability to listen with headphones

          4. Patients who have worked in the field of radiation oncology as they would have
             previously undergone treatment-related education

          5. Patients who have been treated previously with radiation oncology as they would have
             previously undergone treatment-related education

          6. Patients that have been diagnosed with epilepsy, conditions causing seizures, or have
             any previous history of seizures because a very minute number of HMD users have
             experienced a seizure as a result of using the device

          7. Patients with a reported history of cognitive disability as their ability to
             understand educational content may be impaired

          8. Patients with a history of severe motion sickness because a side effect of using a HMD
             in a very small number of users is motion sickness

          9. Patients with a pacemaker, hearing aid(s), and/or defibrillator, while patients with
             other types of electronic medical devices / implants will be assessed for eligibility
             on a case-by-case basis because there could be potential interference with the HMD
