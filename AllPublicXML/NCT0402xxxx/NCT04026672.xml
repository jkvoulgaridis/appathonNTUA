  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presented as an online survey, this study seeks to better understand how Thorne customers are
      using and experiencing the new Hemp Oil + product and how they feel it compares in the
      marketplace. Hemp Oil + is a combination product with a proprietary blend of hemp, clove,
      black pepper, hops, and rosemary extracts. People who have independently elected to purchase
      and use Hemp Oil + before the study starts will be invited to voluntarily participate. If
      they meet study requirements and give consent they will answer questions online about their
      experience with Hemp Oil +. Questions address general demographics and wellness, general
      impressions of the product, how it compares to other products, and any effect it has had on
      their gastrointestinal health, physical discomfort, sleep, and mood. The survey is expected
      to take 15-30 min of participant time. Data will be analyzed to determine whether the
      customer experience with Hemp Oil + is as favorable as it seems from anecdotal reports.
      Analysis will also be conducted to find patterns that can inform future studies, marketing,
      and customer education efforts.
