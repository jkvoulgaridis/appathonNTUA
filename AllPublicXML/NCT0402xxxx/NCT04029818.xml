  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability of Bifidobacterium BSL_PS404 in
      reducing LDL-cholesterol levels in healthy individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong correlation between LDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases.

      Conjugated bile acids help to break down and emulsify dietary fat into micelles that promote
      their absorption by the enterocytes. The disruption or alteration of these micelles may
      interfere with the absorption of cholesterol.

      Several intestinal bacteria strains are capable of carrying out numerous biotransformations
      of bile salts during their enterohepatic circulation, such as the hydrolysis of the
      conjugated bile acids by the action of hydrolases. The mechanism proposed to explain the
      cholesterol-lowering activity of these probiotic strains is that, due to the greater bile
      salt hydroxylation in the intestine, the formation of micelles would decrease and, therefore,
      the absorption of cholesterol and lipids would be decrease too. In addition, probiotics may
      also increase the excretion of bile acids in the stool, possibly by binding or absorbing
      them. This increase in fecal secretion of bile acids would require an increase in the hepatic
      catabolism of cholesterol for the synthesis of bile acids. All these processes may help to
      reduce LDL-cholesterol levels Bifidobacterium BSL_PS404 is a bacterium isolated from maternal
      milk with QPS category that presents a high hydrolase activity that exceeds in more than 20%
      the activity of other reference strains.
