  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction is an integral part of breast cancer care. There are two main types of
      breast reconstruction: alloplastic (using implants), and autologous (using patient's tissue).
      The latter creates a more natural breast mound, and avoids long-term concerns requiring
      surgical re-intervention associated with implant-based surgery. The deep inferior epigastric
      perforator (DIEP) flap is the gold standard technique in autologous breast reconstruction.
      Complications that do occur with DIEP flap surgery often stem from poor flap
      perfusion/oxygenation. Hence, the development of strategies to enhance flap perfusion (e.g.,
      optimal perioperative fluid therapy) is essential. Current perioperative fluid therapy is
      usually guided by subjective criteria which leads to wide variations in fluids administered.
      We will randomly assign DIEP flap patients to receive optimal (cardiac output-guided) fluid
      therapy in combination with dobutamine (a medication which has potential to improve flap
      oxygenation) versus the current standard of care. Flap oxygenation will be monitored in all
      patients for up to 48 hours postoperatively. Optimal fluid therapy in combination with
      dobutamine may improve flap oxygenation and thereby, reduce complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effects of perioperative hemodynamic therapy
      (guided by cardiac output monitoring) on tissue oxygenation during (and after) DIEP flap
      breast reconstruction surgery. We hypothesize that a low-dose, perioperative dobutamine
      infusion combined with goal-directed fluid therapy guided by cardiac output monitoring will
      improve flap perfusion (and, thus, oxygenation) in patients undergoing DIEP surgery.

      The primary outcome is tissue oxygenation, measured via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), 20
      minutes following vascular re-anastomosis of the DIEP flap within the perfusion zone that is
      furthest away from the perforator vessels. Tissue oxygenation will be measured in the zone
      which is the farthest from the perforator vessels. This zone is the most vulnerable surgical
      area to ischemia and, therefore, the most likely to reflect the potential benefits of the
      proposed intervention.

      Secondary outcomes include: (1) tissue oxygenation at baseline (preoperatively), hourly
      intraoperatively, 1, 2, 4, 8 hours postoperatively, as well as the morning of postoperative
      days 1 and 2; (2) the need for intraoperative surgical vascular re-intervention (i.e.,
      re-anastomosis); (3) postoperative complications resulting from flap mal-perfusion (i.e.,
      partial/total flap loss and/or fat necrosis); (4) the need for postoperative surgical
      re-intervention for flap-related issues; (5) the amount of intravenous fluids (crystalloids,
      colloids, blood products) and vasopressors (e.g., phenylephrine, ephedrine, norepinephrine,
      etc) administered intraoperatively as well as 4 hours postoperatively; (6) incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), infection, and hematoma; (7) hospital length of
      stay; and (8) overall patient satisfaction. Differences in perioperative pH, lactate and
      hemoglobin levels, will also be compared between groups.

      Study Design and Duration This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Forty
      participants will be randomized to one of two groups (n=20/group) using computer-generated
      randomization. Patient randomization will be concealed in envelopes and opened only by the
      attending anesthesiologist prior to anesthesia induction. Blinding will be maintained until
      study completion (n=20/group) and verification that all outcome data has been successfully
      collected for all study participants. Each participant will be monitored perioperatively
      until postoperative day 2 (or until discharge from hospital) and will receive a 30 day
      follow-up telephone call.

      Patient Population

      Eligible consenting patients scheduled to undergo an elective DIEP flap breast reconstruction
      surgery under the care of Dr. Martou at the Kingston General Hospital site of Kingston Health
      Sciences Centre.

      Intervention Group: The intervention will commence from the induction of general anaesthesia
      and continue until 4 hrs after surgery. Ringer's lactate (3ml/kg/hr) will be commenced upon
      admission to the operating room to satisfy maintenance fluid requirements. Cardiac output and
      stroke volume will be measured by minimally invasive cardiac output monitor (FloTrac system,
      Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) which attaches to the arterial line
      already in place in this surgical population. No more than 500ml of intravenous fluid will be
      administered prior to commencing cardiac output monitoring. In addition to the maintenance
      fluid described previously, patients will receive 250ml fluid challenges with crystalloid as
      required until they are no longer fluid responsive. Albumin 5% will also be allowed for fluid
      challenges at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. The absence of fluid
      responsiveness will be defined as the absence of a sustained rise in stroke volume of at
      least 10% for 20 minutes or more, at which point and the patient will be considered fluid
      optimized. At this point, a low-dose dobutamine infusion at a fixed rate (2.5 μg/kg/min) will
      be commenced and maintained until 4h postoperative. The infusion rate will be halved and/or
      discontinued if the patient develops a tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 100bpm) for more than 30
      minutes despite adequate anesthesia/analgesia and fluid status (based on the above mentioned
      intervention). Further fluid challenges will be performed by the attending anesthesiologist
      with the aim to maintain a maximal value of stroke volume throughout the case.
      Postoperatively, the patient will remain in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) for a
      minimum of 4 hrs (as per current standard of care) at the end of which, the cardiac output
      monitor will be disconnected from the arterial line, the dobutamine infusion will be
      discontinued, and the patient transferred to a level 2 critical care unit. Ringer's lactate
      at 2ml/kg/hr will be infused to satisfy maintenance fluid requirements until oral fluid
      intake is permitted by the surgical team, at which point the maintenance infusion will be
      stopped. The postoperative maintenance infusion rate will be reduced compared to the
      intraoperative period (3ml/kg/hr) to account for the reduction in insensible fluid losses in
      the postoperative period. Data collection and follow-up for such patients will be performed
      as per standard of care.

      Control group: Patients in the control group will also receive a baseline infusion of
      Ringer's lactate at 3ml/kg/hr to satisfy maintenance fluid requirements, which will be
      commenced upon admission to the operating room. The anesthetic management will otherwise be
      according to standard practice. This will include 250ml fluid challenges with a crystalloid
      administered at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, which is generally guided
      by pulse rate, arterial pressure, urine output, and/or core-peripheral temperature gradient.
      Albumin 5% will also be allowed for fluid challenges at the discretion of the attending
      anesthesiologist. No specific cardiac output monitoring device will be used to guide fluid
      therapy. Likewise, perioperative dobutamine will not be used unless clinically indicated to
      improve cardiac function. It will not be used as described in this protocol (i.e.,
      intervention group) as it is not currently part of our standard practice in these surgeries;
      and there is not yet documented evidence to support its use in all DIEP flap patients. We are
      hoping that this study addresses this gap in knowledge and provides evidence as to whether
      there is benefit to indicate using it as part of standard of care. Postoperative care will be
      similar to the intervention group (except for the cardiac output monitoring and dobutamine
      infusion in PACU).

      A tissue oximeter device (SnapshotNIR, KENT Imaging, Calgary, Canada) will be used in all
      patients. This is a portable non-invasive monitor that measures tissue oxygen saturation
      using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology. Measurements are taken within seconds
      upon hovering the monitor over the skin area where the oxygen levels are intended to be
      measured. Upon admission to the operating room, pre-operative, baseline measurements will be
      recorded over the abdominal flap, followed by sequential recordings upon induction and hourly
      thereafter until completion of the surgical procedure. The surgical team, led by Dr. Martou,
      will guide the measurements to ensure that they are consistently taken from the same surgical
      area throughout the case. Furthermore, the surgical team will have access to the
      intraoperative KENT measurements, which will be used to guide surgical decision-making in an
      attempt to reduce postoperative flap (perfusion-related) complications and ensure the best
      possible surgical outcomes. The attending anesthesiologist, however, will be blinded to the
      KENT measurements throughout the perioperative period, whereas the surgical team will be
      blinded to group allocation, i.e., intervention vs. control. The ischemic period during which
      the flap is transferred (reflected by a fall in the oxygen saturation of the flap21) as well
      as the time of flap revascularization (characterized by increased oxygen saturation21) will
      be recorded. Upon completion of the surgical procedure, another NIRS-based monitor
      (Somanetics INVOS 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter, Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) will be
      utilized. A sticker will be applied over the flap for continuous monitoring of the graft
      oxygenation for up to 48h postoperative. Postoperative measures will be recorded at
      incremental time periods including 1, 2, 4, and 8h, as well as on the morning of
      postoperative days 1 and 2, by the KENT device as well as the continuous monitor (Somanetics
      INVOS). All measures will be consistently taken at the same location.22 Note that
      intraoperative oximetry continuous monitoring with the Somanetics INVOS Oximeter is not
      possible as the sensors cannot be sterilized.

      All surgical procedures will be performed by the same surgeon to minimize variability in
      patient selection and surgical technique, both predictors of clinical outcomes in
      microsurgery.23 Elective DIEP flap surgical procedures and anesthetic management will all be
      completed in accordance with the standard of care. Perioperative management will be identical
      in both groups, apart from the hemodynamic monitoring and interventions as described below.
      In the operating room, room temperature will be set at 20oC and standard monitors will be
      applied. Invasive monitoring in the form of an arterial line will be established as per
      current practice. General anesthesia will be induced with propofol and fentanyl followed by
      rocuronium to facilitate endotracheal intubation; and maintained with sevoflurane
      (Etsevo=1.5-3.0%) and additional doses of fentanyl and/or hydromorphone administered at the
      discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Extra doses of rocuronium will be administered
      throughout the case for muscle relaxation. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg (or within
      20% of baseline) will be targeted throughout the perioperative period. Likewise, all patients
      will receive standard measures to maintain oxygenation (SpO2 ≥95%), end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2)
      between 35-40 mmHg, hemoglobin (&gt;8 g/dl), and heart rate (&lt;100 bpm). A warming device (enFlow
      IV Fluid/Blood Warming System, GE Healthcare, Boston, MA, USA) will be used for intravenous
      fluids, as well as a forced-air patient warming system (3M Bair Hugger Normothermia System,
      3M, St. Paul, MN, USA) in order to maintain normothermia (core temperature 36-37.5 oC).
      Arterial blood gasses will be checked every 2 hours (or more often at the discretion of the
      attending anesthesiologist) to specifically monitor the pH, SpO2, PaO2, PaCO2, base excess,
      hemoglobin, and lactate levels as surrogates for tissue perfusion perioperatively. Urine
      output will be recorded hourly. The total amount of vasopressor, perioperative fluid
      (crystalloids and Albumin 5%) and blood products, if any, will be recorded. In addition, the
      following demographic and surgical characteristics will be included: age, body mass index,
      preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit, levels, American Society of Anesthesiologists
      classification, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and total surgical and anesthetic time.
      Prophylactic iv dexamethasone 4mg on induction of general anesthesia, and ondansetron 4mg 15
      min prior to completion of the surgical procedure will be given for prevention of nausea and
      vomiting. All patients will be managed postoperatively in a high dependency unit (level 2
      critical care) intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with hydromorphone (or an
      alternative in the case of adverse reactions) for post-operative pain management as per
      current standard of care. The postoperative goals (up to 48h postoperative) will be similar
      to the intraoperative period, namely: MAP ≥65 mmHg (or within 20% of baseline), SpO2 ≥95%,
      PaCO2 35-45 mmHg, hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dl, core temperature between 36-37.5 °C, and heart rate
      &lt;100 bpm. Patients will be called 30 days after surgery to document any occurrence of
      complications and they will be asked about their overall satisfaction.

      Rescue Medication &amp; Risk Management All anesthesia and surgical procedures are according to
      standard of care except for the low dose dobutamine infusion intraoperatively and potentially
      up to 4 hours postoperatively, the use of cardiac output monitoring intraoperatively, and
      non-invasive measurements of tissue oxygenation until 48 hours postoperatively. Patients will
      be intensively monitored and medications will be administered as considered medically
      necessary (conversely, no medications deemed medically necessary will be withheld as a result
      of study participation). The main potential side-effect associated with dobutamine is
      tachycardia. In order to mitigate this risk, our protocol proposes a very low-dose infusion.
      In addition, the dobutamine infusion rate will be halved and/or discontinued if the patient
      develops a tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 100bpm) for more than 30 minutes despite adequate
      anesthesia/analgesia and fluid status. In addition, all patients will be intensively
      monitored while in hospital for any adverse events/complications all of which will be
      carefully considered in terms of whether they are related to the study intervention or
      otherwise and action will be taken accordingly.

      Premature Withdrawal / Discontinuation Criteria One of the limitations of a dobutamine
      infusion is tachycardia. The infusion rate will be halved and/or discontinued if a patient
      develops a tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 100bpm) for more than 30 minutes despite adequate
      anesthesia/analgesia and fluid status (based on the above mentioned intervention). If the
      reduced dose does not correct the tachycardia, then the infusion will be turned off. In
      addition, if at any point attending staff raises concerns about the patient being at an
      increased risk because of study participation, the intervention will be stopped and the
      patient removed from the investigation. Also if at any point the patient decides they want to
      withdraw their consent (even afterwards), they will be excluded from the study and none of
      the information collected from them will be used for research purposes. The study
      intervention only applies during surgery and potentially for 4hrs after. All study
      participants will be in a fully monitored setting for the duration of study intervention and
      beyond for up to 48 hours postoperatively. They will have immediate access to any additional
      care or intervention if required. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be monitored
      and documented. Study staff will mandatorily report all SAE's and serious unexpected adverse
      drug reactions (SUSARs) to the investigator for evaluation as soon as they become aware of
      it. All adverse events will be immediately reported to the Queen's University Health Sciences
      and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board and to the Health Canada, Therapeutic
      Products Directorate.

      If patients are withdrawn from the study, we will continue to enroll patients consecutively
      until we have met our stipulated sample size of 20 patients per group. For patients who are
      withdrawn, we will retain any data collected (especially demographic information) and so we
      can compare those who were withdrawn to those who completed the study to determine if they
      differ in this respect (e.g. are older, all male etc.). However, if at any point the patient
      decides they want to withdraw their consent (even afterwards), they will be excluded from the
      study and none of the information collected from them will be used for study purposes.

      Efficacy Variables and Analysis Our primary objective is to establish whether the use of
      minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring for guidance of intravenous fluid
      administration, combined with low-dose dobutamine infusion (via a treatment algorithm), will
      increase tissue oxygenation in patients undergoing DIEP flap surgery, measured by
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The primary outcome is tissue oxygenation, measured via
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), 20 minutes following vascular re-anastomosis of the DIEP
      flap within the perfusion zone that is furthest away from the perforator vessels. Tissue
      oxygenation will be measured in the zone which is the farthest from the perforator vessels.
      This zone is the most vulnerable surgical area to ischemia and, therefore, the more likely to
      reflect the potential benefits of the proposed intervention.

      Tissue oxygenation will also be measured at baseline (preoperatively), hourly
      intraoperatively, 1, 2, 4, 8 hours postoperatively, as well as the morning of postoperative
      days 1 and 2;

      Safety Variables and Analysis:

      Invasive monitoring in the form of an arterial line will be established in all patients for
      intensive monitoring (hemodynamics etc.), as per standard perioperative care for this
      surgical procedure. In addition, cardiac output monitoring will be used to guide intravenous
      fluid administration (including dobutamine) in the intervention group. Other safety variables
      collected will include postoperative complications resulting from flap mal-perfusion (i.e.,
      partial/total flap loss and/or fat necrosis); (2) the need for surgical re-intervention for
      flap-related issues; (3) the amount of intravenous fluids (crystalloids, colloids, blood
      products) administered intraoperatively; (4) incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting,
      infection, and hematoma; and (5) hospital length of stay. Differences in perioperative pH,
      lactate and hemoglobin levels will also be compared between groups.

      Statistical Analysis

      Data will be collected in a password protected Excel file designed for the study, and entered
      into IBM SPSS (version 25.0 for Windows, Armonk, New York 2018) for statistical analysis.
      Descriptive analyses, including means, standard deviations, medians and quartiles for
      continuous data, and frequencies and percentages for categorical data, will be completed for
      all demographic and surgical characteristics, and study outcomes. The underlying
      distributions of all continuous data will be assessed for normality using the Shapiro Wilk
      test. Tissue oxygenation will be compared using independent samples t-tests if the data are
      normally distributed, or the Mann-Whitney U in the event that they are not. Secondary
      outcomes will be compared between the two groups using the Fisher's Exact or Pearson
      chi-square tests (as appropriate depending on cell sizes) for categorical data, and
      independent samples t-tests (or the Mann-Whitney U depending on the underlying distribution)
      for continuous data. Repeated measures ANOVA, with group as a factor, will be used to compare
      the tissue oxygenation over time (baseline, 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours post-operatively; as well as
      baseline, post-operative day 1 and day 2 data). A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be used as the
      criteria for statistical significance and no adjustment will be made for multiple
      comparisons. The possibility of a type I error will be acknowledged and the actual p-values
      will be presented for all comparisons.
