  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine perceptions about daily weighing for pregnant women with
      overweight or obesity by testing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
      daily weighing for reducing excess gestational weight gain (GWG) within the context of a low
      intensity, digital-health based intervention delivered remotely with electronic feedback to
      participants.

    <description>Participants will be asked to use the scale to track their body weight daily at home for six weeks. They will receive a weekly email contact with weight change feedback and either a nutrition or physical activity tip for the week. The study procedures represent minimal risks, and participants will be reminded and encouraged to maintain their regular prenatal care contacts with their provider.</description>
