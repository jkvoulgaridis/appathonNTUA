  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled phase II
      clinical study. It is planned to recruit 74 patients with acquired thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anfibatide as an
      adjuvant therapy for plasma exchange in patients with acquired TTP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 periods: screening(up to 7 days), treatment and follow-up(up to 3
      months). Subjects are assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Anfibatide or placebo during plasma exchange
      with the use of a computerized randomization schedule. The administration is 5 IU/60kg
      intravenous infusion and 0.002 IU/kg/h continuous intravenous infusion. Plasma exchange as
      the main treatment method is performed daily on the 5th day of solstice and then adjusted to
      every other day. Fresh frozen plasma（FFP）and cryoprecipitate-reduced plasma are preferred.
      Subjects will receive the study drug immediately after daily plasma exchange.
