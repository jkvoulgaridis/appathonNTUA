  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is common and well known in children,
      persists into adulthood in more than 60% of cases, with significant impact on quality of
      life. Professional domain is particularly impaired.

      The investigators hypothesize that ADHD symptoms causes professional difficulties, on the
      emotional, cognitive, physical and relational levels.

      The main objective of this study is to better characterize these professional difficulties at
      to follow-up these difficulties after one year. Difficulties will be assessed by
      questionnaires and semi-directive interview.

      The secondary objective is to determine what factors modulate these difficulties and what
      compensation strategies are implemented to address the patients.
