    <textblock>
      This study investigates diagnostic performance of a ring-type wearable device for detecting
      atrial fibrillation. This is a prospective cohort registry study began after the date of IRB
      approval and until 31th Dec. 2019. The eligible criteria are (1) those who admitted the
      institution for elective direct-current cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation, and
      (2) aged 19 years or more. The exclusion criteria are (1) those aged less than 19 years, (2)
      those who are not eligible to perform cardioversion by any reasons. This study aims to
      recruit 200 participants in total. The participants are required to record
      photoplethysmographic signals by the ring device in addition to routine procedures of
      direct-current cardioversion, hence, the study is at minimal risk.

      1. Study title: Diagnostic Performance of a Ring-type Wearable Device Using Deep Learning
           Analysis of Photoplethysmographic Signals for Detecting Atrial Fibrillation.

        2. Study type: Investigator initiated study.

        3. Study design: Prospective observational cohort registry design.

        4. Sponsor: Sky Labs, Inc., Republic of Korea.

        5. The aim of the study: To evaluate diagnostic performance of a ring-type wearable device
           for detecting atrial fibrillation.

        6. Study period: From the date of IRB approval to 31th Dec. 2019.

        7. The size of study population: 200 participants

        8. The eligibility criteria:

      (1) Those with persistent atrial fibrillation (2) Those who admitted the institution for
      elective direct-current cardioversion (3) Those aged 19 years or more 9. The exclusion
      criteria:

      (1) Those with other forms of cardiac arrhythmias (2) Those aged less than 19 hears (3) Those
      who are not eligible to perform electrical cardioversion 10. Procedures of the study

        1. A participant is under the routine procedures of direct-current cardioversion.

        2. On admission, a participant is given with detailed information of the study.

        3. After the informed consent, the only additional procedure due to the study is recording
           photoplethysmographic signal by wearing a ring-type device.

        4. Recorded signals are evaluated without encompassing persornal information. 11. Financial
           benefits to the participants: None.
