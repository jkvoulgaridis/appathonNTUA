          2. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within
             6 months of enrollment (Cohort 1) or randomization (Cohort 2) date with no evidence of
             cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

          3. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements

          4. Have HBV DNA &lt;LLOQ at Screening

          5. ALT normal or, if elevated, &lt;2× ULN with a documented etiology for elevation such as
             non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) confirmed by either ultrasound or controlled
             attenuation parameter (CAP) score &gt;280 on elastography

          6. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of IP. If the urine
             pregnancy test is positive, a follow-up serum test is required for confirmation

          7. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study
             treatment. Men with female partners who are of childbearing potential must agree that
             they or their partners will use a highly effective method of contraception throughout
             the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study treatment. Male subjects must not
             donate sperm throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study
             treatment.

               -  Women of childbearing potential are sexually mature women who have not undergone
                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or who have
                  not been postmenopausal (ie, who have not menstruated at all) for at least 1
                  year.

               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are hormonal contraceptives (oral,
                  injectable, patch, intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total
                  abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. Note: The double-barrier method (eg, synthetic condoms,
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic
                  abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus
                  interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide only are not
                  acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception.

          8. Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF);
             consent must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures

        In addition, subjects must meet the cohort-specific criteria listed below:

             NUCs can include tenofovir, entecavir, telbivudine, lamivudine, adefovir, and
             tenofovir-5TC.

          2. HBsAg &lt;1000 IU at Screening

          3. Planning to discontinue NUC therapy

        Cohort 2:

          1. HBeAg-negative subjects on documented NUCs for ≥1 year with undetectable HBV DNA by
             PCR documented on at least 1 occasion in the last 6 months. NUCs can include
             tenofovir, entecavir, telbivudine, lamivudine, adefovir, and tenofovir-5TC.

          2. Planning to continue NUC therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior liver biopsy evidence of metavir F3 or F4 disease

             allowed)

          4. Laboratory parameters not within defined thresholds:

             transporting polypeptide 1 (OATP1) including, but not limited to, atazanavir,
             rifampin, cyclosporine, eltrombopag, gemfibrozil, lopinavir/ritonavir, and saquinavir

         12. Use of another investigational agent within 3 months of Screening

         13. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere
             with compliance
