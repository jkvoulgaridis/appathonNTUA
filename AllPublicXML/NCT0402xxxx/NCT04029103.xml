      Aim: To develop the Mobile Diabetic Foot Personal Care System (m-DAKBAS) related to foot care
      for diabetic individuals and to evaluate its effectiveness.

      Method: The study involved 88 patients who applied to the Diabetes Polyclinic
      (intervention=44; control=44). While the intervention group used m-DAKBAS (for 6 months), the
      control group was provided with a verbal foot care training once, as a standardized procedure
      of the hospital. Data were collected using the &quot;Socio-demographic Form&quot;, &quot;Diabetic Foot
      Knowledge Form - DFKF&quot;, &quot;Foot Self Care Behaviours Scale -FSCBS&quot;, &quot;Diabetic Foot Care Self
      Efficacy Scale - DFCSES&quot;, and &quot;m-DAKBAS Assessment Form&quot;.

      Diabetic foot, one of the important complications of diabetes, is a health problem that
      affects quality of life in a negative way, that has high treatment and care costs and
      mortality rates, long hospitalization duration and thus with all these aspects a
      psychological, physical, social and economic priority. Despite all these, diabetic foot
      complications and amputations could be decreased with the help of a good foot care, education
      and a multidisciplinary team work. Mobile technologies have been continuously increasing
      worldwide for the management of diabetes, and the use of these technologies is recommended by
      international institutions as well.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a Turkish mobile application that would
      increase patients' knowledge levels about foot health and care, improve their behaviours and
      self-efficacy, and evaluate its effectiveness so that it could be possible to prevent foot
      ulcer and the related amputations in individuals with diabetes. The Mobile Diabetic Foot
      Personal Care System (m-DAKBAS) developed for this purpose enables to increase individuals'
      self-confidence, improve communication with the health personnel, involve patients in their
      own care in an interactive way, and take responsibility.

      The usability of the application was indicated by the patients' feedback, and in line with
      the purpose of the mobile application, improvements in the patients' knowledge, behaviours
      and self-efficacy about foot care in diabetes.

    <description>Diabetic Foot Knowledge Form (DFKF) included 20 questions that aim to measure the knowledge level of individuals with diabetes about diabetic foot and foot care. The questions had three options (True, False, I don't know). Each correct answer was scored 1 point. Higher scores indicate higher knowledge levels</description>

    <description>Foot Self Care Behaviours Scale is composed of 15 items which were assessed as 1=Never, 2=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, 4=Frequently, 5=Always). Scores range between 15 and 75. Higher scores indicate better self care behaviours</description>

    <description>Diabetic Foot Care Self Efficacy Scale has nine items which are rated on an 11-item visual scale that range from 0=I find it totally insufficient and 10= I find it totally sufficient. Scores to be obtained from the scale range between 0 and 90. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy</description>

    <description>m-DAKBAS application was downloaded to the mobile phones of the participants who met the research criteria and accepted to participate in the study; the participants were given a username and a password for the confidentiality. They were instructed how to use the application after a number of trials.
The participants were asked to send their blood sugar levels each time they measured it and foot observations daily through the application. Using the admin panel, the researcher followed the participants' frequency of using the application and the data they sent throughout 24 weeks and tried to find solutions to the problems experienced (for example: hyperglycaemia, insulin dosage adjustments). The participants were provided with feedback in line with these data; SMS reminders were sent if the tasks were not completed.</description>
