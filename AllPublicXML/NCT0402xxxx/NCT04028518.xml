      The primary purpose of this trial is to compare the efficacy of different doses of
      investigator product and comparator product in patients with acute ischemic stroke in 4.5
      Hours after stroke onset, and provide a basis of drug administration for phase Ⅲ clinical
      trial.

      The secondary purpose of this trial is to compare the safety of different dose of
      investigational product and comparator product in patients with acute ischemic stroke in 4.5
      hours afterstroke onset .

      This study is a multicenter, prospective randomised, open blinded endpoint study.

      Patients with acute ischemic stroke need to undergo CT or MRI to exclude intracranial
      hemorrhage and perform NIHSS score before enrollment. Subjects who have passed the screening
      criteria according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to
      low-dose test drugs, high-dose test drugs or reference drugs for thrombolytic therapy at a
      ratio of 1:1:1. The random stratification factor is the thrombolysis time window (&quot;≤3h&quot; vs
      &quot;3~4.5h&quot;).

      The start of administration of the study drug is recorded as 0h, CT or MRI and NIHSS score,
      laboratory test, and electrocardiogram were performed at 24 hours; NIHSS score was performed
      at 72 hours; NIHSS score，laboratory test and electrocardiogram were performed on the14th
      day(the start of administration is recorded as Day 1 ,then the 14th day after administration
      should be recorded as Day 15 ); mRS score and Barthel index score were performed on the 30th
      day (Day 31); mRS score and Barthel index score were performed on the 90th day (Day 91).

    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. The range of scores is from 0 (normal) to 42 (profound effect of stroke on patient).</description>

    <description>The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0-5. A separate category of 6 is usually added for patients who expire. Standardized interviews to obtain a mRS score are recommended at 3 months (90 days) following hospital discharge.
The scale runs from 0-5, running from perfect health without symptoms to Severe disability 0. -No symptoms.
1. -No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
2 .-Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
3. -Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
4. -Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
5. -Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.</description>

    <description>The Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) measures functional disability by quantifying patient performance in 10 activities of daily life. These activities can be grouped according to self-care (feeding, grooming, bathing, dressing, bowel and bladder care, and toilet use) and mobility (ambulation, transfers, and stair climbing). 5-point increments are used in scoring, with a maximal score of 100 indicating that a patient is fully independent in physical functioning, and a lowest score of 0 representing a totally dependent bed-ridden state.</description>
