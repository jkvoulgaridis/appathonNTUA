      Special metals (e.g. Germanium, Titanium, and π element) can be used to produce far-infrared
      radiation. The applications of these metals in promoting blood circulation are worth
      investigating. This clinical trial recruited subjects for using tape made up of Ge, Ti, and π
      element developed by Green Energy Nano Technology Co., Ltd. We assumed that the experimental
      tape can improve the participants' peripheral blood circulation and their quality of life. In
      this clinical trial, the clinical efficacy and safety of the test products were assessed
      using physical examination and questionnaires.

      This study is made of two open-labeled, two-arm studies. 20 to 80 years old patient diagnosed
      with varicose veins were included in the study. Besides, patient with the following
      characteristics was excluded: vulnerable group, patient with an open wound at lower limb
      which cannot be taped, unable to express willingness clearly, Dyslexia, and inability to
      ambulate.

      The final number of total participant is 86 participants and 66 out of 86 participants were
      assigned to the first study which is divided into 2 groups, the experimental and control
      group. The experimental group received the experimental tape as treatment, and the control
      group didn't receive any treatment. The participants will fill in the questionnaires
      including visual Analogue Scale and quality of life on the first day of the study, and fill
      the same questionnaires seven days later.

      Furthermore, the rest of the 20 participants were assigned to the second study. The
      researchers evaluate their peripheral blood circulation by Segmental Blood Pressure over
      Pulse Volume Recording (SBP/PVR), Maximum Venous Outflow over Segmental Venous Capacitance
      (MVO/SVC), and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) before they received the treatment, then the
      researchers inspect the same indexes after they received the treatment right after the first
      tests.
