  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pituitary adenomas are usually benign monoclonal neoplasms caused by a mixture of pituicyte
      alterations together with a changed endocrine and paracrine regulatory milieu. Thus, it can
      cause serious health problems such as abnormal target organ function, pain, disability and
      even death. In clinical practice, we found many patients with pituitary adenomas are usually
      accompanied by hyperlipidemia, which is the main cause of cardiovascular diseases. However,
      it has been unclear if there is an association between pituitary adenomas and serum lipid
      profile. In the present study, we aim to focus on the patients with pituitary adenomas and
      their lipid profile before and after operation including first occurrence and recurrence.

        Patients diagnosed with pituitary adenomas and underwent an endoscopic transsphenoidal
        approach at the Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated with Shandong University. All
        adenomas were resected by transsphenoidal surgery and identified by histological diagnoses.
