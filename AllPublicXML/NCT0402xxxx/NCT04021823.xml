  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational, non-invasive clinical study different neurobiological analyses will be
      performed in a group of patients with severe treatment resistant major depression
      participating in an efficacy study of deep brain stimulation of the superolateral branch of
      the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB) - FORESEE III.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a sub-project of the FORESEE III study (Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial to
      assess Efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the slMFB in Patients with Treatment
      Resistant Major Depression). The FORESEE III study itself is a randomized, sham-controlled,
      double blind (patient and observer blinded) clinical trial to assess the antidepressant
      effect of DBS compared to sham.

      The aim of this sub-project is to analyze the time-course of biological correlates of
      treatment resistant major depression as well as neurobiological markers of treatment response
      to treatment with DBS in a well-characterized patient population during 12 month of DBS.

      Specific neurobiological analyses include testing of

        1. epigenetic markers (DNA methylation in candidate genes of depression and epigenome-wide
           association studies, EWAS) and

        2. markers of neuroinflammation (cytokines, neuropeptides and other immune factors),

        3. micro RNAs and transcriptome signatures as well as

        4. markers of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light protein). All markers will be tested
           in plasma samples before neurosurgery as well as at several time points during DBS and
           sham condition intervals. Additionally

        5. hemodynamic parameters will be analysed at test stimulation of the slMFB during
           neurosurgery.

      The results will be correlated with clinical and other biological response parameters of the
      FORESEE III study and are hypothesized to indicate treatment response as well as allowing
      prediction of response to DBS. All neurobiological analyses will be linked in a tightly
      integrated and comprehensive translational approach.

    <description>Neurofilament light protein is part of the neuroaxonal cytoskeleton and can be released into plasma following neuroaxonal damage. In plasma it will be measured by single-molecule array (SiMoA) assays.</description>

    <description>Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation crucially govern gene function and have been shown to be temporally dynamic and responsive to environmental stress. Epigenetic patterns in blood, saliva or other peripheral material have been suggested to partly reflect central epigenetic processes.
DNA will by isolated and undergo bisulfite conversion. Using pyro- and direct sequencing, samples will be analyzed for DNA methylation in candidate genes of depression.</description>

    <description>A new method of analysis (Proseek® Multiplex Inflammation, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) will be used to determine any change in patterns of relevant neuropeptides and inflammatory markers. This multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) will simultaneously analyze 92 different proteins, including cytokines, neuropeptides and other immune factors.</description>
