      This study was a cross-sectional, retrospective clinical observation study investigating the
      incidence and influencing factors of nocturnal symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease
      through the Parkinson's disease sleep-related scale. At the same time, the effects of
      nocturnal symptoms on the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease were studied.
      About 1,500 Parkinson's patients will be recruited into the study who come from Shanghai,
      China.
