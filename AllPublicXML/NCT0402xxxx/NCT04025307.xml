  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is as an open-label study to be conducted at multiple study centres across New
      Zealand and Australia designed to characterise the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      assessment of the anti-tumour efficacy of bacTRL-IL-12 after intravenous (IV) infusion.

      The study will consist of a screening period (Day -14 to Day -2), treatment and observation
      (Day 1 to Day 22), safety follow-up period (Day 28 to Day 31), and efficacy follow-up period
      (until progression, death, revocation of consent, or lost to follow-up).

    <description>bacTRL-IL-12 is a live, genetically modified Bifidobacterium longum (B longum), for administration via IV infusion. The probiotic bacteria selectively colonize solid tumour tissues and are engineered to deliver genetic material encoding the pro-inflammatory transgene Interleukin-12 (IL-12). Plasmid DNA encoding the IL-12 transgene is delivered to the patient's cells within the tumor microenvironment, whereupon IL-12 is expressed to stimulate local and systemic anti-tumour immune responses.</description>

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 or 1;

          5. Adequate haematological status (regardless of transfusions) defined as:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L;

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L;

               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL;

          6. Adequate renal function, defined as estimated serum creatinine clearance &gt; 45mL/minute
             calculated using Cockcroft-Gault equation

          7. Adequate coagulation function, defined as:

               -  International Normalised Ration &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for that
                  laboratory

               -  Partial thromboplastin time &lt;1.5 x ULN

               -  Exception: monitoring parameters must be within therapeutic range for subjects
                  receiving anti-coagulation therapy

          8. Adequate hepatic function, defined as:

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN unless considered due to Gilbert's disease;

               -  Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase &lt; 1.5 x ULN or &lt; 3 x ULN
                  with documented liver metastases;

          9. Recovery from the toxicities of previous anti-cancer drugs or radiotherapy to Grade 0
             or 1 (or to baseline if condition was pre-existing);

         10. A female subject is eligible to participate if she in not pregnant, not breastfeeding,
             and at least 1 of the following conditions applies:
