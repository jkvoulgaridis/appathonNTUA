  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the impact of the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP) coupled with intensive breastfeeding support to help overweight or obese pregnant women
      lose weight postpartum, improve their blood sugars and blood pressure, and increase duration
      of breastfeeding their infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial seeks to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a
      combined breastfeeding, DPP-based program in a cohort of overweight/obese women to be
      followed during pregnancy through 6 months postpartum. The pilot trial will have three study
      arms: DPP + breastfeeding (Tx1), DPP only (Tx2), and usual care (Tx3). Specific aims are: 1)
      To test the efficacy of Tx1 to improve 6-month postpartum weight loss among women with a BMI
      &gt;/= 25. 2) To test the efficacy of Tx1 to improve 6-month postpartum mean blood glucose
      (HbA1c) and mean arterial blood pressure among women with a BMI &gt;/= 25. 3) To test the
      efficacy of Tx1 to increase any breastfeeding through 6 months postpartum among women with a
      BMI &gt;/= 25.

    <measure>Breastfeeding Knowledge Assessment, Sociodemographic Characteristics, and Health Status (survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this survey is to learn more about what pregnant women know about breastfeeding, to asses sociodemographic characteristics, and to assess health status. The survey consists of 58 items, which are multiple choice. Many include a Likert-type scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree (i.e.: Breast milk changes as my baby grows.) Some questions are open-ended (i.e.: Please share with us what other pre- and post-birth healthcare services including breastfeeding you would like to see offered or any additional comments you may have.) This survey is not scored, but will be used to assess change in breastfeeding knowledge pre- and post- intervention.</description>

    <description>To assess levels of self-efficacy. Survey consists of 14 items. All items are preceded by the phrase &quot;I can always&quot; and are anchored with a 5-point Likert-type scale where 1 indicates not at all confident and 5 indicates always confident. All items are presented positively, and scores are summed to produce a range from 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating higher levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Kaiser Physical Activity Survey (KPAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 6 months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>To assess multiple domains of physical activity and total physical activity before and after pregnancy. Survey consists of 38 items; 4 domains: household and family care activities, occupational activities, active living habits, participation in sports/exercise. Activity indices were created for each domain of activity by summing the domain-specific categorical responses and dividing by the number of items, giving an average value that ranged from 1 to 5. Total activity index is calculated as the sum of all four indices:
Total activity = (household/caregiving index*0.25 + occupational index*0.25 + active living index*0.25 + sports/exercise index*0.25) * 4.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to Tx1 will receive education in both the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and in Breastfeeding. At baseline, this includes 16 DPP sessions (core curriculum), one 2-hour breastfeeding session, and participation in a professional peer support group. The 2-hour breastfeeding session is pre-recorded into four (4) 30-minute sessions and archived on a secure, private Facebook group. Participants will have access to all four breastfeeding sessions by week 24 of pregnancy and they need to complete all sessions by week 30 of pregnancy. At delivery, the patient will receive usual lactation support in the hospital, additional breastfeeding assessment and support (at day 3, day 10, week 3 and week 6), followed by 6 DPP sessions (post-core curriculum).</description>

    <description>Phase 1 (core curriculum) of the Diabetes Prevention Program consists of 16 sessions and will take place during Week 18 of pregnancy through Week 33. Participants will receive the DPP curriculum via virtual pre-recorded sessions to which participants will have access. A research coordinator will follow up with each study participant by phone once weekly. If participants do not make adequate progress, the coordinator will assess how much extra time the participant will need to complete each session and will work with the participant if needed. Phase 2 (post-core curriculum) consists of 6 sessions and will be completed after delivery, between Week 6 and Week 20 postpartum. Participants will re-engage into the DPP with an orientation session at Week 6 postpartum. The same session completion format and procedure for inadequate progress will be followed as during pregnancy.</description>
