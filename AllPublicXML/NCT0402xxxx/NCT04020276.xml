  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a noninvasive local therapy with proven
      efficacy in a number of solid tumor types. However, colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases
      have been shown to be particularly resistant to SBRT, and often are found to have
      significantly worse rates of control compared with other histologies. Higher SBRT dose was
      recently shown to improve local control in CRC pulmonary metastases, however, increasing dose
      delivery with SBRT has been limited based on the risk of toxicity to adjacent structures, and
      the ability to visualize them during treatment. This is particularly relevant in treating
      liver tumors, as tumor and small bowel movement can often make tumor targeting and
      organs-at-risk (OAR) avoidance especially difficult. MRI-guided SBRT for liver tumors is both
      safe and feasible and offers an as yet unprecedented opportunity to achieve the highest
      possible safe dose to liver tumors.

      The purpose of this trial is to identify a safe maximum tolerated dose level for MRI-guided
      SBRT treatment of bowel and liver metastases, respectively.

      Eligible participants will be on study for up to 12 months.
