  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a retrospective clinical observational cohort study. All patients with chronic
      hepatitis B (CHB) whose HBsAg decreased by less than 10% were treated continuously with
      interferon in the Department of Hepatology, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Beijing Medical
      University, Beijing Capital University, 2008.10-2017.4. The total interferon treatment time
      of the enrolled subjects was 48 weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the following
      two observation cohorts: 1) patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with continuous
      interferon for 48 weeks; 2) intermittent interferon For 48 weeks of treatment for patients
      with chronic hepatitis B, the interferon treatment interval was 3 months. HBV DNA content,
      HBsAg/anti-HBs, HBeAg/anti-HBe and biochemical markers, serum AFP and liver imaging (liver
      ultrasound) were collected before treatment (baseline) and during treatment. The primary
      outcome measure was the rate at which HBsAg disappeared at 48 weeks of treatment. The
      secondary evaluation index was the 48-week HBeAg seroconversion rate. To investigate the
      efficacy, influencing factors and safety of interferon intermittent treatment of chronic
      hepatitis B.
