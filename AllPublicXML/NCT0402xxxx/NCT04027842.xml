  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown beneficial effects of prewarming on preventing inadvertent
      perioperative hypothermia (IPH). Warming the surface of the body before the induction of
      anesthesia can reduce the temperature difference between the core and periphery, thereby
      reducing the degree of core-to-peripheral thermal redistribution. It has been proved that
      initiation of warming before surgery can be more useful for preventing IPH than warming only
      during surgery. Nevertheless, there are not many researches on effects of short period (&lt;30
      min) prewarming, especially in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Accordingly, the
      investigators designed this study to test if IPH can be effectively prevented when 10 minutes
      of prewarming is added to intraoperative active warming in patients undergoing gynecologic
      laparoscopic surgery.

    <description>Participants in Prewarming group was warmed with forced air warming device (WarmTouch WT 6000 Warming Unit, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) over the entire body for 10 minutes before anesthesia was induced in the operating theater. All participants received active warming with forced air warming system from the initiation of anesthetic induction until end of surgery.</description>

    <description>In Non-prewarming group, no active warming was conducted before induction of anesthesia. Only standard care was provided with introperative active warming with forced air warming system from the initiation of anesthetic induction until end of surgery.</description>

    <description>In the operating theater, participants allocated in Prewarming group received 10 min-prewarming, which is cutaneous warming before induction of anesthesia. For prewarming, forced air warming system (WarmTouch WT 6000 Warming Unit, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used and the warming temperature of the device was set to 45°C.</description>
