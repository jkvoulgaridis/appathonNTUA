  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be examining slow-wave characteristics in depressed patients receiving
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) using direct current electroencephalogram (dcEEG) by
      anesthesia induction agent.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot project using dcEEG to look at infra-slow waves in depressed patients
      receiving ECT randomized to ketamine or methohexital where ketamine suppresses infra-slow
      waves. The rationale for this project is to identify biomarkers of treatment adequacy in ECT,
      which could lead to decreased morbidity and mortality with the procedure and lessen the
      burden of depression in our patient population.

    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Measures global cognitive function. 0-30 with higher score indicates better cognitive function
Dot Counting Test measures effort. Time to completion and errors recorded. Higher times/error rates indicate decreased effort
Test of Premorbid Function estimates premorbid intellectual function. Negative change indicates greater cognitive &amp; memory function impairment
Autobiographical Memory Test. Free recall of retrospective autobiographical memories. 0-20 with higher score indicating improved memory function
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. Free recall, and recognition memory. Retention % calculated. Higher percentage indicates improved cognitive function
Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference &amp; Verbal Fluency Test. Processing speed, sequencing and cognitive flexibility
