  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) alone or in association with
      antiCTLA4 (Ipilimumab) are established as indisputable treatment of metastatic melanoma, with
      unprecedented overall survival, and are indicated for first-line treatment including patients
      with BRAF mutation. Given their high molecular weight, their penetration in the brain
      sanctuary is uncertain and relies on disruption of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) which occurs
      occasionally.

      SonoCloud® is an implantable device delivering low intensity pulsed UltraSound (US). Along
      with systemic injection of an US resonator, SonoCloud® demonstrated safe and efficient at
      repetitively opening the BBB. The investigators anticipate that BBB opening could help at
      increasing brain penetration of monoclonal antibodies and potentially boosting immunity in
      the brain. This could translate in controlling brain disease with the same magnitude as for
      extra-cranial disease. This would also open avenues for optimizing the treatment of brain
      metastases in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in many other cancers.

    <description>Dose with the highest probability of BBB opening efficacy without toxicity directly related to the ultrasound emission.
Toxicity evaluation:
Safety will be assessed clinically and using brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An electroencephalogram will be performed only if clinically needed. Dose-Limiting-Toxicities (DLTs) evaluation will be done during the first 4 weeks of treatment for Nivolumab treatment and 6 weeks for Nivolumab + Ipilimumab treatment. DLTs directly related to the ultrasound emission are defined as occurrence of an adverse effect during the first administration of treatment, such as: :
neurological deficit within 2 days after the procedure and persistent at day 15;
localized brain edema not preexisting to the procedure;
occurrence of cerebral median line deviation not controlled by routine treatment or requiring salvage surgical procedure;
partial epilepsy induced or enhanced after the procedure and not control</description>

    <description>The SonoCloud System is an active implantable medical. The SonoCloud is indicated to locally and transiently increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to facilitate the passage of substances into the cerebral parenchyma.
The SonoCloud System consists of :
an implantable ultrasound transducer,
a needle connection device,
an external radiofrequency generator, and
an ultrasound resonator. The SonoCloud® is designed to be fixed to the skull. The device is placed in a burr hole or in place of a bone flap and ultrasound energy is delivered directly to the brain tissue, without traversing the skull bone. The device is activated by connecting the implant to the external generator system using the transdermal needle. Once connected to the external generator, the implant delivers low-intensity pulsed UltraSound (US) for duration of 120-270 seconds. A total of 3 US dose levels will be evaluated (0.78, 0.9 and 1.03 MPa).</description>
