  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast feeding is the primary step for healthy generations. Breast milk protects against
      diseases of childhood period starting from infancy till adulthood. Inspite of the benefits of
      breast milk due to various reasons a lot of women all around the world and in our country can
      not begin breast feeding and leave it at an early stage even if they start once. According to
      Turkey Population and Health Investigation (TPHI) data of 2013; while the rate of only breast
      feeding among; 0-1 month babies is 57.9%, among babies under 6 months this rate falls to
      10.0%. In the case of maternals not carrying out the whole breast feeding conditions
      situations such as milk secretion decrease, troubles related to breast, babies declining
      breast and ending breast feeding at an early stage are seen. These problems are related to
      the self-effıcacy that maternal feels towards breast feeding. The researches show that in
      addition to the maternal, father`s attitude throughout pregnancy is also effective on
      starting breast feeding, sustaining and maintaining it efficiently.

      With this research it has been aimed to evaluate the effect of individual and group breast
      feeding training of future mother and father at postpartum period on breast-feeding
      self-effıcacy and attitude.

      Research data has been gathered at Turkey Public Hospitals Institution Izmir North Public
      Hospitals Association of T.R Ministry of Health Tepecik Education and Reserach Hospital
      between the dates 01 March-30 September 2014.

      As a result; it has been seen that breast feeding training is not alone enough to improve
      self sufficiency and attitude, and maternals have to be supported by health staff at
      postpartum period in hospital. It is suggested to include also fathers to the breast feeding
      training provided at pregnancy period.

      Breastfeeding training was given to the mother and father candidates in the individual and
      group education group. At this stage, standard care and service in the hospital was offered
      to the mothers and fathers in the control group. A follow-up plan was prepared for all the
      mothers and fathers after the discharge from the phone.

    <intervention_model_description>The pregnant women and partners who came to the hospital were evaluated in terms of sample criteria and randomized sampling was divided into three groups.
In order to be able to perform randomized sampling, the selection of the groups to the individual breastfeeding education, group breastfeeding education and control group was determined by throwing a coin.
After the first group was identified, a research group was taken for each day.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Questionnaires were prepared separately for parents in each follow-up. Breastfeeding status, nipple cracking, breastfeeding support status were evaluated in the first week, sixth week and fourth month in the mother follow-up forms.
The questionnaire to be applied during pregnancy consists of three topics and a total of 25 questions.
There are questions about the sociodemographic characteristics (10), fertility characteristics (9) and breastfeeding characteristics (6) of the mothers.
In the questionnaire to be applied in the first week after birth, there are questions about the characteristics of birth and breastfeeding (30).
In the sixth week, there is a questionnaire (18) containing questions about breastfeeding and finally a questionnaire containing questions about breastfeeding status (18) at the fourth month.
During the first week, sixth week and fourth month follow-up, fathers' breastfeeding support status was questioned.</description>

    <measure>Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale:</measure>
    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed by Cindy-Lee Dennis to measure breastfeeding self-efficacy and consists of 2 sub-scales and 33 items. The cronbach alpha value of the scale developed by Cindy-Lee Dennis was measured as 0.95. The validity and reliability of the breastfeeding self-efficacy scale in Turkish was made by Eksioglu. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.91 and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the &quot;Technical&quot; sub-dimension was 0.89. Breastfeeding self-efficacy increases as the total score increases.The lowest score is 33 and the highest score is 165. The scale was administered to mothers four times. The first application was performed before the training in antenatal period and the other applications were done in the first week, sixth week and fourth month.</description>

    <measure>IOWA Infant Feeding and Attitude Scale (IIFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by De La Mora and Russell, the IIFAS was developed to assess the attitudes of mothers to breastfeeding and consists of 17 items. The cronbach's alpha value of the scale was 0.86. The validity and reliability study in our country was conducted by Eksioğlu et al. And the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated as 0.71. It is designed to estimate the time of breastfeeding as well as choice of infant feeding method.
Scale; It consists of 17 items evaluated with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
Nine of the items showed positive formula feeding, whereas these items were counter-rated.
The total score was between 17 and 85, and the higher the mean score of the scale, the higher the positive attitude of breastfeeding, and the lower the mean score of the scale, the higher the tendency towards formula feeding.
The scale was applied to the parents four times.</description>
