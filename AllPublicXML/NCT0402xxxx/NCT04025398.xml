  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with intellectual disabilities have great difficulty in adapting to social situations
      and relationships. Cognitive impairment associated with intellectual disability are important
      factors to understand their difficulties in processing social information. In the field of
      recognition of facial emotions in particular, basic cognitive processes such as visuospatial
      and attentional functions, are heavily involved. Cognitive remediation is a management tool
      widely used by practitioners to help patients who experience cognitive difficulties.
      Currently, no program can meet specific and validated the problems are adults with
      intellectual disabilities manner in their daily functioning

      Réhabilitus is a remediation program focused on attentional functions and visuospatial, to
      limit the presence of behavioral disorders among adults with intellectual disabilities. The
      main objective is to validate the effectiveness of Réhabilitus program on behavioral
      disorders in adults with intellectual disabilities without autism spectrum disorder
      associated.
