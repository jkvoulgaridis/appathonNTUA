  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether elastic band resistance exercise (EBRE) as a home-based rehabilitation routine can
      control the glycated heamoglobin (HbA1c) level and improve the muscle strength, dynamic
      balance, and physical function in older patients with comorbid T2DM and knee OA?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: Randomised controlled trial. Participants: Seventy patients diagnosed with T2DM
      together with knee OA. Intervention: Patients in the experimental and control group were
      instructed by clinical staff to perform home-based exercises and followed up through phone
      calls. The experimental group performed exercises using an elastic resistance band with 10
      repetitions/set × 5 sets/day × 3 days/week. The control group underwent active joint
      range-of-motion exercises and isometric contraction exercises. The intervention regimens
      lasted 12 weeks.
