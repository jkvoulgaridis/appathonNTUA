  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that priming attachment security is associated with improved
      attitudes towards therapy, increased engagement and decreased levels of depression and
      anxiety. Within the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme a consistent
      problem has been identified of high dropout rates at step 2 services (i.e. where mild to
      moderate anxious and depressed patients receive guided self-help interventions). The current
      study incorporates a feasibility and pilot design. The feasibility element will explore
      issues related to study design to determine suitability for conducting a future randomised
      control trial (RCT). The pilot study will look at the processes outlined in the protocol to
      determine whether the study components all work together. Moreover, it will preliminarily aim
      to explore the effectiveness of the attachment security priming intervention on symptoms of
      depression and anxiety, as well as impaired functioning. Both elements of the study will
      determine whether any changes are needed to the study design or protocol, and whether a
      future RCT is suitable and necessary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted in an IAPT primary care service in North Yorkshire. The study
      will be recruiting 50 participants experiencing mild to moderate depression who are deemed
      suitable for 'behavioural activation' low intensity guided self-help intervention. Following
      telephone screening for intervention, clinicians will ask clients if they wish to hear more
      about participating in a research study. If participants say yes, their contact details will
      be passed on to the researcher who will send them the study information sheet and consent
      form in the post. If the participant consents to taking part in the research, they will be
      randomised to receive either treatment as usual (low-intensity guided self-help utilising
      behavioural activation for depression) or treatment with security priming intervention
      (treatment as usual with an additional security priming task). They will have between 6-8
      sessions as routinely delivered within the service and will be asked to complete measures of
      depression, anxiety and impaired functioning on a sessional basis. The principal investigator
      at the study site will collect information regarding attendance to therapy, dropout rates,
      and 'stepping' clients up to higher-intensity therapies as primary outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>The feasibility element of the study will aim to explore service users' willingness to participate in the study; clinician's willingness to recruit participants; whether the recruitment method is effective in recruiting participants; and to assess attrition rates.
The pilot study aims to look at the processes involved in the study as outlined in the protocol, and whether any of these require changes to inform a larger scale RCT; this includes whether the recruitment, randomisation and treatment processes can be carried out effectively. Moreover, the study aims to determine whether the attachment security priming intervention appears to be effective in reducing therapy drop-out; increasing attendance to therapy; and decreasing rates of clients' being stepped-up to step 3 high-intensity services. Secondary to this, the study aims to assess whether priming attachment security appears to have an impact upon levels of depression, anxiety and impaired functioning.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The participant will not explicitly be told which condition they are in by the researcher or the clinician working directly with them. However, they are likely to be able to infer this from the treatment being delivered, having read the information sheet regarding the study. The clinician working with the participant will be aware what condition they are in so that they are able to deliver the appropriate intervention.</masking_description>

    <description>In addition to their treatment as usual (low-intensity guided self-help behavioural activation for depression), participants will complete an initial attachment security priming task during the first session with their allocated clinician. Participants will be prompted in their intervention workbook with a caption regarding what a secure attachment relationship represents. They will be asked to think of a person/ people with whom they feel they have this relationship, and list them. Following this, they are asked to plot these individuals on a diagram of concentric circles in relation to how close they feel this person is to them. The closer to the middle of the diagram the individual places each person, the closer they feel their relationship to that person is.
Prior to each session with their clinician, they will be prompted to complete a repeated security priming task in order to increase feelings of security prior to therapy sessions.</description>
