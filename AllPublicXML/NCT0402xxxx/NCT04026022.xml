  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is an examination whether a modified perioperative pain management system,
      that integrates the 2017 European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) guidelines for treatment
      of postoperative Delirium, can improve patient's wellbeing in comparison to the current
      certified standard management.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate whether the integration of the 2017 ESA guidelines for
      treatment of postoperative Delirium in a pain management, can improve patient's wellbeing in
      comparison to the current certified standard management. Adherence to the modified management
      includes minimizing nil per os time, renouncing benzodiazepines, 1.8 ltr crystalloid infusion
      per day, simplified standard medication option and postoperative 12µg/h Fentanyl TTS for 72h
      (for wound pain).

    <description>Wellbeing assessed with the &quot;Anaesthesiological Questionnaire&quot; (ANP) which is a self-rating method for the assessment of postoperative complaints and patient wellbeing. The rating scales from 0 to 3, with 0=&quot;none&quot; and 3=&quot;strongly&quot;. Higher wellbeing values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Pain will be assessed with the (verbal) Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and statistically evaluated for differences between the two study groups. NRS scales from 1 to 10, with 1 describing the lowest pain score and 10 the highest pain score. Lower NRS describes a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated perioperatively with a new pain management, that has been modified to integrate the 2017 ESA guidelines on prevention/treatment of postoperative delirium. Moreover patients will be administered a 12µg/h Fentanyl TTS in the ER or PACU. The ER TTS will only be administered if the patients still has mild to intense pain after initial i.v. treatment as well as reposition of the fractured hip. Further aspects of the modified management are: avoiding benzodiazepines, allowing oral fluids up to 2 hours before surgery, intraoperative monitoring of anaesthesia depth and at least 1,8 ltr crystalloid infusion per day</description>
