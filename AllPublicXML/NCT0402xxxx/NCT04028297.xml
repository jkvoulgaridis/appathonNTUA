  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze in patients with undifferentiated shock, the concordance
      of initial treatment before and after Focus cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) in comparison with the
      reference one established by an adjudication committee

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focus cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) has already demonstrated its ability to reduce diagnosis
      uncertainty in patients with undifferentiated shock. However, adequacy of initial treatment
      has not been investigated.

      In patients with undifferentiated shock, after clinical evaluation, the physician states its
      hypothesis and initial treatment intention in closed list. He realizes a FoCUS, states
      another time the hypothesis and begins treatment according to FoCUS results. An adjudication
      committee with all the patient's file will state the reference hypothesis and treatment
