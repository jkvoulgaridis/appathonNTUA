      This is a virtual study which will invite females over the age of 18 who have had 2 or more
      UTIs in the past 6 months to participate. The investigators are looking at the impact of a
      daily dietary supplement with the recurrence of UTIs. Participants will be blinded and
      randomized randomized into the Control Group or Groups 1 or 2. Control Group will receive a
      Placebo Drink-Mix and Placebo Capsules. Group 1 will receive the Uqora Drink-Mix and Placebo
      Capsules. Group 2 will receive the Uqora Drink-Mix and Uqora Capsules. Each group will
      receive 180 day supply of the products.

    <textblock>
      Urinary Track Infections (UTIs) are the second most common infection in the United Stated.
      There is growing concern about the amount of antibiotic use and drug resistance. Patients
      with frequent UTIs are encouraged to keep well hydrated. Some are encouraged to drink
      cranberry juice or cranberry extract. In 2016 a published study demonstrated no difference.
      The investigators hypothesize that the Uqora dietary supplement will decrease the frequency
      of UTIs.

      The study was designed as a prospective randomized blinded study. Results will be patient
      reported results along with any confirmation of a documented UTI. Participants will be asked
      to keep a weekly diary logging the supplement intake. The participant will also be asked to
      complete the King's Health Questionnaire, a urinary health questionnaire and quality of life.
      The data will be entered by the participant into a portal using a personalized login and
      password.

        The study will consist of 360 female subjects aged 18 and older with at least 2 UTIs in the
        past 6 months. The subjects will be otherwise healthy. The geography of subject enrollment
        will be spread across the United States.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is female

          -  Is 18 years of age or older

          -  Is able to swallow pills

          -  Has been treated with antibiotics for 2 or more UTIs in the past 6 months

          -  Is otherwise in good health Subjects will be deemed to be in good health if they do
             not report any of the existing medical conditions asked about in the screening
             questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has any of the following medical conditions: multiple sclerosis; diabetes; chronic
             kidney stones ○ Subjects with multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and/ or chronic kidney
             stones will be excluded from the study because these subjects are more likely to have
             complicated UTIs.

          -  Uses a wheelchair ○ Subjects that use a wheelchair will be excluded from the study as
             these subjects are more likely to have complicated UTIs.

          -  Regularly uses a catheter

             ○ Subjects that use catheters will be excluded from the study as these subjects are
             more likely to have complicated UTIs.

          -  Is pregnant

             ○ Pregnant women and women that become pregnant will be excluded from the study
             because of an increased likelihood these subjects will drop out from the study on
             recommendation from their physicians or other healthcare provider.

          -  Is currently taking Uqora brand products for UTI prevention

             ○ Subjects will be asked if they are currently taking other products for UTI
             prevention. If the subject indicates she is currently taking a Uqora product, she will
             be excluded from the study. If the subject indicates she is taking additional products
             for prevention (not Uqora products), she will not be excluded from the study and she
             will be eligible to be enrolled and randomly assigned into 1 of the 3 groups.

          -  Is currently taking antibiotics prophylactically for the purpose of UTI prevention ○
             These subjects will be excluded from the study because they have been instructed by
             their physician or other healthcare provider to take antibiotics on an ongoing basis,
             which would have a significant impact on the recurrence of UTIs.
