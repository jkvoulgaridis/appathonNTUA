      A prospective cohort study was performed in patients with angina pectoris who were treated
      with oral Chinese patent medicine and Western medicine.Collect primary and secondary efficacy
      indicators such as the incidence of cardiovascular events, using clinical samples to detect
      genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, intestinal flora and sclerotia.To explore the clinical
      efficacy of Chinese patent medicine in the treatment of coronary heart disease with angina
      pectoris, and provide reliable data support for its clinical application.
