    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the postoperative changes after a major surgery in head
      and neck cancer patients. Each participant will be evaluated three times: (1) One day before
      surgery; (2) one month postoperative and (3) three months postoperative. Assessments included
      blood pressure, anthropometric measurements, physical measurements and questionnaires on
      quality of life, nutritional status and cancer symptoms.
