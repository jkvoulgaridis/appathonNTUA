      A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with angina pectoris who were treated
      with oral Chinese patent medicine and Western medicine.The hospital's medical record
      management system was used to collect symptoms of angina pectoris, dose and frequency of
      nitroglycerin use, clinical biochemical test and imaging examination.To explore the clinical
      efficacy of Chinese patent medicine in the treatment of coronary heart disease with angina
      pectoris, and provide reliable data support for its clinical application.
