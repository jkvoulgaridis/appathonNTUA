      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic
      conditioning combined with intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 50 cases of ischemic stroke who undergo intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5
      hours from onset are included. The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote
      ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis. The
      control group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2
      times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis . Two groups will be followed up for 90
      days to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning combined with
      intravenous thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke.

Additionally,the patients will be treated with standard medical treatment according to Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China 2014.</description>
