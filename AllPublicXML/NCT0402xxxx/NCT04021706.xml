  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with low muscle mass also usually have low bone mass, making them vulnerable to falls,
      fractures and other injuries. This project will determine the effectiveness of treatment with
      a ghrelin receptor agonist in improving short term indicators of muscle and bone health in
      adults with low bone and muscle mass. The results of this trial will inform the design of a
      larger, definitive randomized trial designed to establish efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with both osteopenia and sarcopenia (osteosarcopenia) have greater risk of falls and
      fractures than those with osteopenia or sarcopenia alone. Drugs are available to reduce
      fracture risk but currently exercise is the only effective strategy to combat muscle loss.
      Unfortunately, the majority of adults who start a self-monitored exercise program drop out
      after 6 months and other options are needed. Ghrelin receptor agonists have been under
      development to treat anorexia and weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia. The agonist
      anamorelin has significantly increased weight and lean tissue mass in these patients.
      Anamorelin mimics the hormone ghrelin which not only increases appetite, but also acts on the
      pituitary to increase pulsatile growth hormone (GH) secretion. Pulsatile GH stimulates the
      production of insulin-like growth factor 1 which is anabolic to both muscle and bone. GH
      levels decline with age and this is thought to contribute to the age-related muscle and bone
      losses in adults. The central hypothesis is that anamorelin will increase muscle mass,
      improve muscle function, and increase bone formation in adults with osteosarcopenia. To test
      this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, 2-armed,
      parallel-group intervention trial in 40 osteosarcopenic men and postmenopausal women age 50
      and older. Participants will be randomized to anamorelin (100 mg per day) or placebo and
      treated for 12 months. The primary endpoint is increase in appendicular lean tissue mass
      measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary endpoints are: increases in muscle
      strength (isometric leg strength) and function (6-minute walk and modified short physical
      performance battery), an increase in total body muscle mass, an increase in the bone
      formation biomarker, amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and an increase in total lean
      (non-fat, non-bone) tissue mass. The proposed treatment supplies the anabolic stimulus to
      build both muscle and bone. Anamorelin has not been tested in adults with osteosarcopenia.
      The investigators propose to evaluate this treatment in osteosarcopenic adults who are most
      in need of treatment and who are also most likely to benefit. Data obtained from this pilot
      study are critical to determine the feasibility and guide the design of a definitive trial to
      evaluate this ghrelin receptor agonist as potential therapy to mitigate the dual hazards of
      osteopenia and sarcopenia.
