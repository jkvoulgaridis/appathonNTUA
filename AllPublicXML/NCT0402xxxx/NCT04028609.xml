    <textblock>
      This study tests an intervention designed to avoid 30-day readmissions following a medical
      hospitalization by patients who have co-occurring mental illness. The Intervention is
      delivered by community health workers in the inpatient setting and 30 days following hospital
      discharge to the community.

    <textblock>
      This study will test the efficacy of a brief intervention delivered to adults with
      co-occurring medical and mental health conditions by community health workers designed to
      avoid 30-day readmissions following medical hospitalization. Adult inpatients of a university
      hospital will be randomly assigned to the intervention plus services as usual versus services
      as usual alone, and assessed at baseline and 30 days following discharge. Chi square will be
      used to assess the primary outcome of admission within 30 days of discharge and changes in
      patient activation, mental health symptoms, medication adherence, and perceived competence
      for health maintenance. Also examined will be study condition differences in post-discharge
      inpatient service utilization and cost.

    <time_frame>30 days post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a dichotomous indicator variable that reports the occurrence of an inpatient admission to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from a previous hospitalization. Score ranges from 0 (no readmission) to 1 (readmission).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the construct of a person's self-perceived ability to engage in health care. Items assess patients' self-perceived level of knowledge, skill, and confidence in their ability to manage their own health. Total score ranges from 13 to 52 with higher values indicating greater activation. Total score is calculated by summing items to create a raw score which is then divided by the number of items answered and multiplied by 13 and transformed to a Z score based on calibration tables.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Competence for Health Maintenance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the construct of self rated ability to manage one's health condition, engage in routine health care, and recover from a medical condition. Total score ranges from 1 to 7 with higher values indicating greater competence. Total score is calculated by averaging scores of the 4 items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the construct of self-reported adherence to prescribed medications by asking about forgetting to take medication, deciding not to take medication, and feeling inconvenienced by having to take medication. Total score ranges from 0 to 8 with higher values indicating greater adherence. Total score is the sum of all item responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the construct of self-reported physical and emotional health by asking about functioning (e.g., climbing stairs, doing housework) and emotional well-being (e.g., feeling calm and peaceful, being downhearted or blue). Total score ranges from 12 to 44 with higher values indicating better health. Total score is the sum of all item responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care Climate Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the construct of a patients' perception of their medical care as as providing needed information, acknowledging their feelings, and supporting their autonomy. Total score ranges from 1 to 7 with higher values indicating greater autonomy. Total score is calculated by averaging the item scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Usual Source of Medical Care</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>These items from a national household survey ask respondents about their access to and type of usual source of medical care. Both items are categorical self-report questions designed to yield descriptive information with no scoring.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This a questionnaire that measures the construct of patients' satisfaction with their medical provider by asking them to rate their doctor's communication, time spent, and overall satisfaction. Total score ranges from 6 to 30 with higher values indicating greater satisfaction. Total score is calculated by adding the item scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-2</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry (pre-intervention), 30 days post discharge (post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a screening questionnaire for depression and anhedonia that measures the extent to which respondents report that they are sad, hopeless, and have little interest in doing things. Total score ranges from 0 to 6 with higher values indicating greater likelihood of depressive disorder. Total score is calculated by adding the 2 item scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
