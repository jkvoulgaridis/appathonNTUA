                  multidisciplinary Heart Team, for at least one month 5. Patient is high-risk for
                  open-heart surgery based on the assessment of the multidisciplinary Heart Team

          4. Active ulcer or gastro-intestinal bleeding in the past 3 months

          5. History of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy or refusal of future blood transfusion

          6. Patients in whom TEE is not feasible

          7. Patients who are pregnant or lactating, or plan to get pregnant in the next 12 months.
