  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether metformin combined with exenatide once
      weekly (EQW) is more effective than metformin alone in the treatment of overweight/obese
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Background therapies were Diane-35 or/and
      progesterone capsule. 80 participants were randomized to use either metformin or
      metformin+EQW for 12 weeks. Greater changes in body weight were anticipated in patients
      treated with EQW+metformin than metformin alone in those treated with metformin.

    <description>This system divides the face, chest, and upper back into 6 areas: the forehead, right cheek,left cheek, nose, chin, and torso (chest and upper back combined). Each acne lesion is described and scored as a comedo (1 point), papule (2 points), pustule (3 points), or nodule (4 points); absence of an acne lesion in an area results in a score of 0 points. The local score for each anatomic area is determined by multiplying the score of the most severe lesion by an area factor (1 to 3), and the local scores of the 6 areas are then added together to obtain the total score. Acne severity is graded as none (total score, 0 points), mild (total score, 1-18 points), moderate (total score, 19-30 points), severe (total score, 31-38 points), and very severe (total score N38 points)</description>
