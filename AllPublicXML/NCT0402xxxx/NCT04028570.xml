  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find the maximum tolerated dose level for malignant pleural mesothelioma
      patients receiving background radiation + boost radiation, and surgery. Boost radiation is an
      experimental form of radiation that involves targeting non-uniform high doses of radiation to
      bulky pleural masses. We hypothesize the immunologic abscopal effect is an important
      component in controlling disease, and may be stimulated with highly hypofractionated doses.
      Doses will increase with every three patients who will be enrolled in the study until the
      background radiation reaches 1800 cGy or the maximum tolerated dose, whichever is lower.

      This study aims to find the maximum tolerated dose level for mesothelioma patients receiving
      background radiation + boost radiation, and surgery. 3 patients will start with a background
      radiation therapy (RT) dose of 0 cGy, and boost RT of at least 2100 cGy. If the radiation is
      manageable (radiation related AEs grade &lt; 4), the next set of 3 patients will be enrolled,
      and the background radiation dose will be increased by 600 cGy. This will continue until the
      background radiation dose reaches 1800 cGy. If 1 patient exhibits dose limiting toxicities
      (AEs grade 4 &amp; 5), the dose level will repeat with the next 3 patients. If 2 or more patients
      exhibit DLTs, the previous dose level will be determined as the maximum tolerated dose level.
      Surgery will be scheduled to occur approximately 1-2 weeks after completing radiation
      therapy, and will subsequently be followed up as per study schedule.

    <description>This study involves a 3+3 design. The starting cohort (n=3) will receive a neoadjuvant Background dose to the affected hemithorax (starting at 0 cGy) as well as concomitant Boost dose (of at least 2100 cGy) to a part of the gross tumour volume (GTV). The radiation will be delivered over 3 alternate days over 5-7 calendar days followed by macroscopically complete extensive pleural resection (either extra-pleural pneumonectomy or extended pleurectomy decortication, at the surgeon's discretion) after 7 to 14 days. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) seen, then the Background RT dose will be increased by 600 cGy (up to 1800 cGy) and the cohort (n=3) for the next dose level will be accrued. If only 1 DLT seen, then an additional 3 patients will be treated on this dose level. If 2 or more DLTs seen at any given dose level, then the previous dose level will be defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients will be stratified by type of resection.</description>
