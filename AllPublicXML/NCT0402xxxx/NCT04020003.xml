  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the curative effect of Levosimendan on ARDS
      patients through omni-directional and multi-angle objective quantitative indexes, and to
      study the responsiveness of ARDS with or without right ventricular insufficiency to the
      treatment of Levosimendan, and to indirectly confirm whether Levosimendan had lung protective
      mechanism other than calcium sensitization to ARDS patients, such as inhibiting inflammatory
      reaction to reduce pulmonary capillary leakage and alveolar epithelial cell injury.
      Relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle improves pulmonary ventilation function. To provide new
      methods and ideas for clinical treatment of ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the basis of the above research, the investigators speculate that Levosimendan can improve
      cardiac function, enhance diaphragm contractility and decrease pulmonary artery through this
      sensitizing effect, and protect ARDS lung function by regulating the release and oxidation of
      inflammatory mediators and nitroso oxidative stress. The hemodynamic and pulmonary protective
      effects of ARDS patients were improved by regulating K-ATP channels, relieving blood vessels
      and bronchospasm and improving ventilation and diffusion function in ARDS patients, so as to
      further improve the survival rate of these patients and shorten the mechanical ventilation
      time and ICU stay time. The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of Levosimendan
      on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function in patients with ARDS, to determine
      whether it can reduce the fatality rate of ARDS and shorten its ICU residence time, and to
      evaluate the evaluation of ARDS with or without right ventricular insufficiency and to
      provide a new idea and method for drug treatment of ARDS.

Levosimendan group: on the basis of routine group treatment, 12.5 mg of levosimendan 5% GS 50ml was given on the same day, and the micro-pump was continuously pumped for 24 hours. The initial dose was 0.5 ml/ h, and if the blood pressure was not significantly decreased, the blood pressure was gradually increased to 2.4 ml/ h at the maximum dose, until the pump was over. The above treatment is repeated every 7 days until the offline success or the patient leaves the ICU.</description>
