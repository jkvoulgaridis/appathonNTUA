      This study aimed to collect and analyze clinical specimens of patients with classic
      infectious diseases in the real world. To investigate the epidemiological distribution of
      classic infectious diseases (brucellosis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, kala-azar) and
      treatment options suitable for China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brucellosis is present in humans and animals in nearly 170 countries and regions around the
      world. In the 1950s and 1960s, brucellosis was seriously prevalent in China. In the 1970s,
      the epidemic gradually declined. It was basically controlled in the 1980s and early 1990s,
      but since the mid-1990s, the epidemic has continued to rise rapidly, and brucellosis It has
      become one of the fastest infectious diseases reporting the rising incidence rate. In 2016,
      47,139 cases were reported, with an incidence rate of 3.44/100,000. The provinces with the
      most reported cases are Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
      Shanxi Province and Heilongjiang Province. However, in the southern non-pastoral areas of
      Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province, brucellosis outbreaks have occurred in recent years,
      and the incidence rates in Henan and Fujian provinces have continued to rise.

      Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, also known as epidemic hemorrhagic fever, is an
      infectious disease caused by the Hantavirus. The main clinical features are fever, exudation,
      hemorrhage, hypotensive shock, and kidney damage. It was once epidemic viral infection in
      China after viral hepatitis. In the 1980s, the number of cases reported exceeded 100,000.
      More than 1650,000 patients have been reported in China since 1950, including more than
      47,000 deaths, with a total case fatality rate of approximately 2.89%. The number of people
      in the province accounted for more than 80% of the total number of people in the country.
      From 2004 to 2015, Shaanxi Province and the three northeastern provinces were the hardest hit
      areas of national hemorrhagic fever.

      There are reports of sporadic leishmaniasis in China, but they are rare and lack
      corresponding epidemiological data. In 2015, 507 new cases of visceral leishmaniasis were
      reported, which was a high level in the past 10 years. However, the incidence rate remains at
      a low level of 0.0372/100,000. In recent years, visceral leishmaniasis is mainly distributed
      in the northwestern part of China, and there are many cases reported in the southwestern part
      of the country. The three areas with the highest incidence rate are Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
      Region, Gansu Province and Sichuan Province. The cases in non-endemic areas are mainly adults
      who go to work in popular areas, and mainly male physical workers, while the popular areas
      are mainly infants and young children.
