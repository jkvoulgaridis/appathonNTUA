  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure control is crucial for individuals' wellbeing. However, many daily aspects
      such as diet could impair blood pressure control. In addition, many people living under
      different conditions in different countries are affected by some kind of gum disease. These
      people experience gingival bleeding, bad breath, teeth mobility and pain. Throughout gum
      disease development the number of oral germs in the mouth increases including their levels in
      tongue surface. Oral bacterial are able to convert nitrate widely found in food in nitrite
      which influences blood pressure. Frequently treatment of gum diseases general combines manual
      instrumentation with mouthwashes. However, it has been suggested that reduction of oral
      bacteria by mouthwashes, especially chlorhexidine, is accompanied by decreased conversion of
      nitrate to nitrite and that this minor nitrite availability would increase blood pressure.
      Therefore, this is a point to be clarified for patients, physicians and dentists.

      This study will investigate the relation between treatment with mouthwashes and blood
      pressure of patients with destructive gum disease based on nitrite levels in saliva,
      bacterial levels in tongue and values of arterial blood pressure which will be monitored over
      6 months. In addition, usual clinical parameters and alteration of oral cells' DNA will be
      also monitored overtime. Patients will be treated under local anesthesia and manual
      instrumentation within 24 hours. They will receive oral care products too. There will be 3
      treatment groups (manual instrumentation + chlorhexidine mouthwash [2 times a day for 3
      weeks], manual instrumentation + placebo mouthwash [2 times a day for 3 weeks] and manual
      instrumentation + no mouthwash) and 2 dental appointments before treatment. After treatment,
      patients will be examined at 7, 14, 21, 90 and 180 days. Saliva, plaque and cell sampling
      will be fast and by no invasive methods.
