  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one in five children in the United States has a mental health problem that interferes
      with daily functioning and requires intervention, and yet less than 50% of children who need
      mental health care receive any services. Families and especially from low-income and
      ethnically diverse backgrounds, experience a range of barriers to engaging in services for
      their children including: lack of recognition of problems and knowledge of available
      treatments, connecting to services, trust in providers, stigma; low income and ethnically
      diverse populations are especially affected by these barriers. In this work, the
      investigators propose to carry out initial testing of a research- and theory-based model of
      Parent Peer Navigation services to help engage families with children with significant but
      pre-clinical problems in mental health services in order to prevent future poorer outcomes
      for children, who otherwise may never receive services, or only receive services when their
      mental health issues become severely debilitating for themselves and their family.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parent peer navigation (PPN), provided by other caregivers who have lived experience raising
      a youth with mental health conditions, holds promise as a service that can aid in improving
      both youth and caregiver outcomes by overcoming system- and individual-level barriers to
      care. This proposed study will support initial testing of a research- and theory- based
      Parent Peer Navigation (PPN) model created by one of the nation's leading advocacy
      organizations for caregivers of children and youth with mental health challenges, the
      federally funded Family-Run Executive Directors Leadership Association. This model, called
      the National Parent Peer Support Practice Model (Practice Model) has an associated training
      program and aims to effectively engage parents/caregivers in necessary treatment for their
      children by helping them connect with assessment, treatment and community-based resources and
      prepare them to independently navigate the child serving system, community-based resources,
      and ongoing opportunities for support once the PPN provider is no longer involved. The
      Practice Model incorporates five theory- and research-based components of support: (1)
      information/educational, (2) instructional/skills development; (3) emotional/ affirming, (4)
      instrumental; and (5) advocacy. The study will focus on children in early stages of
      impairment as a result of mental health challenges for which prevention of further disability
      is possible. It will take advantage of implementation of the Practice Model through two
      non-profit family-run organizations (FROs) and will occur in three phases, beginning with
      preparatory work to develop recruitment strategies in collaboration with local schools,
      formalize implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity) and
      other measures followed by a Feasibility Study to finalize recruitment, procedures and
      measurement frames. Finally, in Phase 3, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized
      trial to provide a preliminary test of the impact of the Practice Model on key caregiver and
      child outcomes. Children who are experiencing mental health challenges but have not had
      exposure to formal mental health services will be identified by collaborating schools and
      referred for family support. Consenting families will be randomly assigned to a treatment
      group who will receive PPN services based on the Practice Model from participating FROs, or a
      comparison group who will be referred to a Family Support Organization which provide other
      types of resources (e.g., referrals, information). The investigators predict that youth and
      parents receiving PPN will show significantly greater rates of access, engagement and
      retention in services as compared to the comparison group. The investigators also predict
      that at 6 months following PPN onset, children in the treatment group will exhibit improved
      social/emotional functioning and that parents in the treatment group will exhibit increased
      empowerment and decreased parenting stress, as compared to those in the comparison group.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ a randomized trial to provide a preliminary test of the impact of Parent Peer Navigation (PPN) on key caregiver and child outcomes. We will recruit children and families through schools in Pennsylvania and Wyoming, connected to participating Family Run Organizations, who will then be referred randomly to either a (1) Family Support Organization (FSO) that provides only information and referrals by staff who are not family members with lived experience or (2) one of the FROs (Allegheny Family Network in Pennsylvania or UPLIFT in Wyoming) that provides PPN by family members with lived experience. Children and families will be nested within schools nested within states.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Brief Form of the Services Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA) obtains for each service setting, information about the specific type of service used, provider, duration and frequency of use, and reason for use.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement in the PPN intervention will be assessed with the Working Alliance Inventory, Short Form (WAI-S), a 12-item adaptation of the Working Alliance Inventory to assess: (1) agreement on goals; (2) agreement on tasks; and (3) the development of bond.

    <description>In this arm, families receive PPN services from a trained provider with lived experience whose role is to effectively engage parents/caregivers in necessary treatment for their children by helping them connect with assessment, treatment and community-based resources and prepare them to independently navigate the child serving system, community-based resources, and ongoing opportunities for support once the PPN is no longer involved. PPN providers use the foundational competencies and skills to educate, inform and support families who are just entering the child-serving systems due to emerging behavioral health issues of their child.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Resources provided by Family Support Organization</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The active comparator is service provided by Family Support Organizations (FSOs), which provide information and resources for families about disabilities, special education and other services as well as workshops and parent support groups. Unlike PPN services, FSO staff members are not &quot;veteran caregivers&quot; of a child with mental health challenges, do not provide personalized service delivery, do not provide a comprehensive assessment of family needs, and do not prepare families to make use of services through support for their initial and continued involvement in them. Finally, whereas PPNs participate in comprehensive training and coaching, training for FSO staff tends to be more general and consists primarily of being aware of local resources to which families may be referred.</description>

    <intervention_name>Parent Peer Navigation</intervention_name>
    <description>Parent Peer Navigation (PPN) is implemented by trained providers with lived experience, who are supported by training and coaching protocols. The role of PPN provider is to engage caregivers in necessary treatment for their children and prepare them to independently navigate the child serving system, community-based resources, and ongoing opportunities for support. PPN providers will support families who are just entering he child-serving systems for 6 months on a weekly basis during which they will: help link families with formal and informal supports; instill confidence and coping skills; assist in the development of goals and crisis plans; and serve as an advocate for resolution of issues. Also, the PPN provider helps the family to learn to navigate systems and advocate for their needs, prepares families for meetings and treatment sessions, helps identify ways for parents to practice self-care; and promotes family choice and shared decision making.</description>
