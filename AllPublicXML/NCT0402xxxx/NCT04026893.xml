  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study will explore the feasibility of initiating a deceased donor uterine transplant
      program in addition to the existing living donor IRB at BWH.

      Using the template established by teams around the world, we will identify emotionally and
      socially stable females of reproductive age with intact ovaries who are unable to gestate a
      child due to congenital or acquired uterine factor infertility. After careful screening,
      participants will undergo egg harvest, in vitro fertilization, and embryo cryopreservation
      using standard methods. Women who successfully complete the fertilization of at least six
      euploid embryos will be eligible to be placed on the waitlist for a deceased donor uterus
      transplant. After a successful transplant and a period of observation to ensure normal
      menstrual cycle and graft viability (anticipate six months), embryo implantation will be
      undertaken.

      Following an embryo transfer, gestation will be carefully monitored by our high-risk
      pregnancy specialists. Medical research interventions include the surgical implantation of a
      uterus utilizing techniques by teams that have applied this approach successfully, close
      post-transplant follow up including immunosuppression therapy tailored to established
      standards during pregnancy minimizing fetal risks, and careful management of pregnancy. After
      childbearing is complete (at most two gestations), the donor uterus will be removed either
      during Cesarean or during an elective procedure. In addition, open ended interviews and
      surveys will be conducted to elicit ethical and psychosocial concerns arising from the
      experience of subjects and their families, health care providers, and the wider community.
      The investigator's intent is to monitor outcomes for transplant recipients as well as the
      live born infants for 30 days after removal of the transplanted uterus.

      It is estimated that the time from screening to a potential live birth will be a minimum of
      22 months, but likely between 24 - 36 months depending on organ availability.

    <description>The recipient will be started on anti-rejection medications (as is routine for transplant recipients) prior to the OR. Standard of care anesthesia and line placement will take place. The recipient will be appropriately identified as an organ recipient and the donor organ identified per required transplant protocols already in place. The recipient team will then connect the vasculature and appropriate supporting structures for the uterus transplant. Once the organ has been re-perfused, the remainder of the operation will take place and the patient will be moved to the Intensive Care Unit and later to the transplant patient floor for standard monitoring.</description>
