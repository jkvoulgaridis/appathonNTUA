  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to compare clinical outcomes, implementation metrics (i.e.,
      patient reach and clinician adoption), and clinician preferences of two designs (customized
      vs. commercial) of a clinical decision support (CDS). Beta blocker prescribing for patients
      with heart failure will be used as a test case. The best practices in CDS design, including
      the user-centered design will be incorporated into the customized CDS and compared to a
      commercially-available CDS in the electronic health record using a cluster randomized trial.

    <description>The commercial CDS is available to all institutions using the Epic electronic health record vendor, but violates some CDS design best practices, notably not being tailored to the end users of a given health system. The recommendation will be to initiate an evidence-based beta blocker for heart failure.</description>
