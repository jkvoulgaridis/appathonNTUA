    <textblock>
      Urinary kallidinogenase may assist recovery acute ischemic stroke. This study evaluated the
      impact of urinary kallidinogenase on NIHSS score, modified Rankin scale (mRS) score and
      fasting glucose levels in patients with AIS combined with diabetes mellitus and impaired
      fasting glucose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AIS and abnormal glucose metabolism were enrolled in this prospective cohort
      study and divided into two groups. The HUK group were treated with urinary kallidinogenase
      and standard treatment, the control group received standard treatment. NIHSS scores, mRS
      scores and fasting blood glucose were evaluated and compared.

    <description>Based on NIHSS score，multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the factors related to non-general recovery (90-day NIHSS was reduced by &lt;90%) for all patients.
Evaluation of NIHSS score: General recovery was when NIHSS score was reduced by 90%-100%; Non-general recovery referred to when NIHSS score was reduced by &lt;90%.</description>

Based on mRS，multivariate analysis was also performed to evaluate the factors related to poor curative effect (90-day mRS ≥3) for all patients.
Evaluation of mRS score: mRS score of 0-2 points referred to a good curative effect, and 3-5 points referred to a poor curative effect.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18-75 years (male or female)

          -  Patients were admitted to hospital within 72h of stroke onset

          -  Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke according to the criteria stated in the Guidelines
             for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in China (2010), and patients
             were confirmed as acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease by head computed tomography
             (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)

          -  NIHSS score ranged from 3-21 points

          -  Patients were previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, in which they were in line
             with the 2006 WHO diagnostic criteria for diabetes, or they had fasting blood glucose
             of 6.1-6.9mmol/L and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of&gt;6.1%

          -  Patients could cooperate with the test and evaluation of relevant indicators in the
             trial.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with severe heart, liver and kidney dysfunction

          -  Patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease and who still suffered from serious
             neurological dysfunction that had an influence on the trial

          -  Patients with physical disabilities, joint deformities or muscle lesions

          -  Patients were confirmed with intracranial hemorrhage by CT

          -  Patients were allergic to the study drug

          -  Patients who had participated in other clinical trials within 1 month

          -  For any reason, the researchers believed that the subject was unlikely to complete the
             study (such as cerebral infarction caused by cerebral embolism, intracranial
             arteritis, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
             leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and moyamoya disease; patients undergoing thrombolysis
             or thrombectomy after admission; patients and their families were unable to cooperate
             with follow-up.)
