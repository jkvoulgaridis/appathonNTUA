          5. Cohort 4 only: Prior treatment with fulvestrant, or known hypersensitivity to

                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  TAS-120 administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient
                  inappropriate for entry into this study

          7. Brain metastases that are untreated or clinically or radiologically unstable (that is,
             have been stable for &lt;1 month)
