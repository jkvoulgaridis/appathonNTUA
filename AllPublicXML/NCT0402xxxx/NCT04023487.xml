    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate (1) the efficacy of REAL-T, a lifestyle-based telehealth
      intervention, in improving glycemic control (HbA1c) and psychosocial outcomes, (2) which
      effects are retained over a 6-month follow-up period, and (3) the mediating mechanisms
      responsible for the intervention's effects. Half of participants will receive REAL-T, while
      the other half will receive their usual care.

      Evaluation of a Complex Behavioral Intervention for Young Adults with Diabetes: The
      Resilient, Empowered, Active Living-Telehealth (REAL-T) Study will address the unmet
      self-management and psychosocial needs of young adults (YAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

      We will conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial (n=210) to compare the 6-month
      REAL-T intervention to usual care in improving glycemic control (A1c and continuous glucose
      monitor-derived measures), psychosocial well-being, and hypothesized intervention mediators.
      In addition, we will perform health economic analyses to determine the extent to which REAL-T
      is cost-effective or produces cost savings.

      The study's specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of REAL-T in improving glycemic control and psychosocial
      well-being.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Over a 6-month intervention period (including 3 and 6 month measures), YAs
           with T1D who receive REAL-T demonstrate improvements in glycemic control, in comparison
           to YAs with T1D who receive usual care.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Over a 6-month period (including 3 and 6 month measures), YAs with T1D who
           receive REAL-T demonstrate gains in psychosocial well-being in comparison to YAs with
           T1D who receive usual care.

      Aim 2: Assess the post-intervention durability (at 3 and 6 months post-intervention) of
      REAL-T's effects on glycemic control and psychosocial well-being.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Among YAs with T1D, improvements in glycemic control that result from
           REAL-T relative to usual care are maintained at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Among YAs with T1D, improvements in psychosocial well-being that result
           from REAL-T relative to usual care are maintained at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

      Aim 3: Examine mediating mechanisms of the REAL-T intervention's effects on glycemic control
      and psychosocial well-being through structural equation modeling (SEM).

        -  Hypothesis 1: Improvements in diabetes self-care behaviors mediate positive intervention
           effects on glycemic control and psychosocial well-being.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Improvements in self-efficacy mediate positive intervention effects on
           psychosocial well-being and partially mediate positive effects on diabetes self-care
           behaviors.

        -  Hypothesis 3: Improvements in habit strength for diabetes self-care behaviors partially
           mediate positive intervention effects on the performance of diabetes self-care
           behaviors.

    <measure>Change in diabetes-related quality of life, using the &quot;Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life-15&quot; (ADD-QoL-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>15-item questionnaire assessing diabetes-related quality of life (qol). Each item contains two parts. Part A is: &quot;If I did not have diabetes, [the question topic] would be&quot;, followed by 5 options ranging from &quot;very much better&quot; (or similar; scored as -3) to &quot;worse&quot; (or similar; scored as 1). The fourth option is always &quot;the same&quot; and scored as 0. Part B is: &quot;[the question topic] is&quot; followed by 4 options ranging from &quot;very important&quot; (scored as 3) to &quot;not at all important&quot; (scored as 0). For each question, scores on parts A and B are multiplied, and the 15 products are summed for a total score. Questions 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, &amp; 11 have preliminary yes/no questions, and when a &quot;no&quot; response is given, parts A and B are skipped and the score for that question is 0. The minimum score on each question is -9 and the maximum is 3, with total scores ranging from -135 to 45. Positive scores reflect perceived positive impact of diabetes on qol; negative scores reflect perceived negative impact on qol.</description>

    <measure>Change in functional health and well-being, using the &quot;SF-12v2Â® Health Survey&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form 12-item Health Survey Ver. 2 (SF-12v2) is a 12-item questionnaire assessing functional health &amp; well-being over the last 4 weeks in 8 health domains (physical functioning, role participation with physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional health problems, mental health), all from the patient's point of view. These 8 domains can be summarized into a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). Higher scores indicate a better health state. MCS and PCS scores range from 0-100. Scores are calibrated using general population-derived normative data so that 50 is the avg score or norm. Results can be further summarized into a single preference-based health utility number ranging from 1 (equivalent to perfect health) to 0 (equivalent to being dead), using a complex scoring algorithm (SF-6D) derived from surveying a general U.S. population's preferences for specific health states.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in autonomy of taking insulin and/or checking blood sugar, using the &quot;Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire&quot; (TSRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>19-item questionnaire, adapted for type 1 diabetes, assessing the degree to which a person's motivation for a particular behavior or a set of behaviors is relatively autonomous or self-determined. Each item can receive a value ranging from 1 - 7 as selected by the participant. The scale has 2 sub-scales: the autonomous regulatory style and the controlled regulatory style. Calculating the scores for the sub-scales consists of averaging the items on that sub-scale. A Relative Autonomous Motivation Index can be formed by subtracting the average for the controlled reasons from the average for the autonomous reasons. Scores range from 1 to 7, with 7 indicating a strong identification with the given autonomy style. The autonomous regulatory style represents the most self-determined form of motivation.</description>
