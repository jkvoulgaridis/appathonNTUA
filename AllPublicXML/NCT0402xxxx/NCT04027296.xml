  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the GLORI-COPD score in
      ambulatory care, to enable the screening of COPD patients at risk of complications, requiring
      early management

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease with a high prevalence in
      France, but which remains under-diagnosed due to the trivialization of symptoms and
      difficulty in accessing diagnostic investigations. It is associated with other
      co-morbidities, with an impact on the occurrence of complications and quality of life. Early
      management of the most severe patients would allow better control of these risks of
      complications. Our objective is to better identify patients with COPD at risk of
      complications in general practice, taking into account the totality of the patient, to
      improve their management.
