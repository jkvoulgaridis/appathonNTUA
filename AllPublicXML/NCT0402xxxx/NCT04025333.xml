    <textblock>
      This study aims at understanding the needs and concerns of the ethnic minority in Hong Kong,
      including their behavior, attitudes, and experiences related to smoking and smoking
      cessation. Specifically, how the level of smoking-related knowledge among them differ from
      the rest of the Hong Kong people, will be explored. In addition, whether Hong Kong smoking
      policy influenced the smoking pattern of them will be investigated.

    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the most significant preventable cause of death and disease, causing 6
      million deaths annually worldwide. Despite the fact that tobacco use in Hong Kong has been
      decreased from 23.3% in 1982 to 10.1% in 2017, the remaining 620 600 daily smokers[3] cannot
      be overlooked or undervalued.

      Hong Kong is a predominantly Chinese society, but it has a sizeable South Asian ethnic
      minority (EM). According to the Census &amp; Statistics Department, the number of ethnic
      minorities in Hong Kong increased significantly by 70.8% over the past 10 years.
      Nevertheless, few smoking and health promotion activities and smoking cessation services have
      been tailor-made for ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. The barrier of supplying smoking
      cessation service to the ethnic minority group is that their smoking motivation, willingness
      to quit, obstacles of quit smoking, attitude towards Hong Kong tobacco law and smoking
      cessation services are not sure. This will be the first research exploring their knowledge,
      attitude and experience of cigarette smoking.
