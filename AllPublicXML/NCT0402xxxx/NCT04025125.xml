  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to generate evidence-based recommendations for the management of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in People Living with HIV (PLWH). The overall objectives of
      this application are to demonstrate the effect of cardiology referral on CVD outcomes in a
      racially/ethnically diverse cohort of PLWH, and to generate qualitative data with which to
      develop of a future intervention. Our central hypothesis is that cardiology referral reduces
      incident CVD events in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM) populations with HIV
      compared to nonreferral. Our hypothesis has been formulated based on our own work identifying
      that race and provider specialty impact cardiovascular risk management. The rationale for our
      research is that, once it is known how URM populations with HIV access cardiology referrals,
      and the impact on CVD outcomes, an intervention can be appropriately designed resulting in
      new and innovative approaches to the management of URM PLWH at elevated CVD risk.

        Aims 1 and 2 not recruiting patients

        Aims 3 population of interest:

          1. Race equals Black/African-American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native
             Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or More than one race, and/or Ethnicity equals Hispanic or
             Latino;

          2. Documented evidence of HIV positive status (HIV positive diagnosis and prescription of
             antiretroviral therapy (ART));

        Aims 1 and 2 are not recruiting as retrospective review of electronic health records.

        Aims 1 and 2 Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient health records may be accessed from subjects who meet the following criteria:

          1. Race equals Black/African-American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native
             Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or More than one race, and/or Ethnicity equals Hispanic or
             Latino;

          2. Documented evidence of HIV positive status (HIV positive diagnosis (ICD10 codes
             B20-B24, or ICD9 codes 042, V08) and prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART));

          3. Documented evidence of elevated AtheroSclerotic CardioVascular Disease risk (ACC/AHA
             ASCVD 10 year risk ≥5%24, or Framingham Cardiovascular Disease 10 year risk ≥5%25)
             after HIV diagnosis. The date when the patient first meets either of these CVD risk
             thresholds and with 1 prior encounter not having CVD risk score defines the index
             time-point for Aim 1 of this study. These risk calculations depend on sex, age, body
             mass index, diabetes, current smoking, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic
             blood pressure, and treatment for hypertension (defined from diagnosis codes). If
             cholesterol measures are not available, then body mass index may be used in place of
             lipids in the Framingham risk calculation; NOTE: must have a prior encounter within
             365 days within health system prior to index

          4. Presence of a modifiable risk factor: hypertension, diabetes, elevated total
             cholesterol, elevated LDL cholesterol and/or tobacco use.

        Aims 1 and 2 Exclusion criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 years of age or &gt;99 years of age at index event;

          2. Pre-existing ASCVD prior to index event, including a previous diagnosis of any acute
             myocardial infarction, heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, stable or unstable
             angina, arterial revascularization (includes coronary arterial or peripheral), stroke,
             transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of
             atherosclerotic origin determined by ICD codes;

          3. Encounter with cardiology specialist within 1 year prior to index

          4. Evidence of ART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (i.e., Truvada [emtricitabine/tenofovir
             disoproxil fumarate] or post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g., Truvada plus raltegravir)
             without HIV diagnosis.
