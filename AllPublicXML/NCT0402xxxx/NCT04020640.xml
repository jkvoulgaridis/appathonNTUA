      Research Aim: We assessed human milk intakes of Thai infants during the first 6 months
      comparing exclusive (EBF), predominant (PBF) and partial (PartBF) breastfeeding.

      Methods: One-hundred and ten apparently healthy Thai lactating mother-infant pairs were
      followed from birth. Human milk intakes were determined at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, using the
      DTM method. Daily energy and protein intakes were assessed using 3-day non-consecutive
      24-hour recalls. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected using a questionnaire. For
      comparisons among breastfeeding practices, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used
      for normally distributed data, or Kruskal-Wallis Test with Mann-Whitney U Test for not
      normally distributed data.

      Human milk intakes were comparable between the EBF and PBF infants during the first 6 months,
      and provided the sole source of energy and protein; infant formula largely replaced breast
      milk among PartBF infants.
