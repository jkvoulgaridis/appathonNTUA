    <measure>Confirm that PCD-1000A PET/CT System is Effective for Its Intended Use</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PCD-1000A PET/CT system's performance will be evaluated for oncology PET imaging on cancer patients to verify that the system performs as expected.
â€¢ Verify that all supported clinical protocols from PET acquisition, reconstruction, to presentation (filtering) perform as expected. Images acquired by PCD-1000A PET/CT will be compared with images acquired during a standard-of-care PET/CT scan by a commercially available PET/CT system just prior to imaging with the PCD-1000A PET/CT System. Image quality evaluation will include assessment of uniformity of the liver, delineation of the lungs, presence of artifacts and using Likert scale.</description>
