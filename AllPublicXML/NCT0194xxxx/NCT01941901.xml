      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of calcium electroporation on cutaneous
      metastases, and compare calcium electroporation with standard treatment: electrochemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blinded phase II clinical study. We will compare the effect of calcium electroporation
      for the treatment of cutaneous metastases with standard treatment: electrochemotherapy with
      intratumoral injection of bleomycin. Separate randomisation will be performed and the lesions
      will be treated with either intratumoral injection of calcium or bleomycin. It is a once only
      treatment and the patients will be followed up for 6 months.

      It is a non-inferiority study and we accept a difference in response on 15%.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with cutanoues tumors of any cancer histology were included, and metastases were marked, numbered and photographed. Syringes with either calcium or bleomycin were prepared by a pharmacist, blinded for the treating clinician. After injection of study drug (calcium or bleomycin), electroporation was performed. Metastases were followed and at the 6 month follow-up response was recorded for treated metastases and the actual drug used for each metastasis was revealed.</intervention_model_description>
