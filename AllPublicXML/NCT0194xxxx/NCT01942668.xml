  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, multicenter trial of postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus who meet the study entry criteria will be
      randomized to one of five treatment arms (four active and one placebo) and followed for 12
      months. During the Screening period all subjects will be provided with a diary to self-assess
      the frequency and severity of their vasomotor symptoms. Subjects experiencing a minimum daily
      frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will participate in a VMS
      Substudy during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The Substudy subjects will be stratified by
      treatment arm within the sites, and only Substudy subjects have the possibility of being
      randomized to placebo. Subjects who qualify for the study except for experiencing a minimum
      daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will be stratified
      within sites to one of the four active treatment arms and followed for 12 months, but will
      not participate in the VMS Substudy. (However, VMS information will be collected from all
      subjects during the first 12 weeks of treatment.) All Study Subjects: Postmenopausal women
      with an intact uterus who seek relief from hot flushes and meet all other inclusion/exclusion
      criteria are eligible for 12 months of study treatment.

      VMS Substudy Subjects: A subset of All Study Subjects who have ≥7 per day or ≥50 per week
      moderate to severe hot flushes (as determined during Screening) are eligible for the 12-week
      VMS Substudy and for a total of 12 months of study treatment.

      Clinical evaluations will be performed at the following time points:

        -  Screening Period (Week: - 8.5) (up to -60 Days)

        -  Visit 1 Randomization (Week 0) (Day 1)

        -  Visit 2 Interim (Week 4)

        -  Visit 3 Interim (Week 8)

        -  Visit 4 Interim (Week 12)

        -  Visit 5 Interim (Month 6)

        -  Visit 6 Interim (Month 9)

    <description>Endometrial biopsies centrally evaluated by 2 primary pathologists using criteria from Blaustein's Pathology text. Pathologists classified bx into 1 of following 3 categories: Cat.1: Non-endometrial malignancy/non-hyperplasia; Cat.2: Endometrial hyperplasia; Cat.3: Endometrial malignancy. Consensus reached when 2 primary pathologist agreed on any of above categories; if primary pathologists disagreed on presence of hyperplasia, result of 3rd pathologist was utilized and final decision regarding presence of hyperplasia was based on diagnosis of majority. If all 3 reads disparate, final diagnosis based on most severe dx. Incidence rate calculated as: I=A/B where I=incidence rate at M12 evaluation, A=all new subjects with biopsies positive for endometrial hyperplasia during study but post-Baseline, B=all subjects w/biopsies following M11 meeting criteria specified plus all subjects w/biopsies positive for endometrial hyperplasia by any pathologists before M11.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be a female between the ages of 40 and 65 years (at the time of randomization) who is
             willing to participate in the study, as documented by signing the informed consent
             form.

          2. Be a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus and a Screening serum estradiol level
             of ≤50 pg/mL. Postmenopausal is defined herein as:

               1. ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or

               2. at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a Screening serum FSH level of
                  &gt;40 mIU/ml, or

               3. ≥ 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy.

          3. Be seeking treatment or relief for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

          4. To participate in the VMS Substudy, a subject must also report ≥7 moderate to severe
             hot flushes per day, or ≥50 per week, at the baseline assessment during Screening
             (subjects whose hot flushes are less frequent may still participate as non-Substudy
             subjects.

             Note: A minimum of 14 consecutive days of complete hot flush diary data are required
             during the baseline assessment at Screening, and these consecutive days must occur
             within the last 14 days prior to the Randomization visit (not counting the
             Randomization visit day itself). The most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to
             randomization (Day -7 to Day -1) will be used to determine the baseline number of
             mild, moderate and severe hot flushes for each subject.

          5. Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 34 kg/mP2P. (BMI values should be
             rounded to the nearest integer [e.g., 34.4 rounds down to 34, while 26.5 rounds up to
             27]).

          6. Be willing to abstain from using products (other than study medication) that contain
             estrogen, progestin, or progesterone throughout study participation.

          7. Be judged by the principal or sub-investigator physician as being in otherwise
             generally good health based on a medical evaluation performed during the Screening
             period prior to the initial dose of study medication. The medical evaluation findings
             must include:

               1. a normal or non-clinically significant physical examination, including vital
                  signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature).
                  Sitting systolic blood pressure is ≤140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≤90
                  mmHg at Screening. A subject may be taking up to two antihypertensive
                  medications.

               2. a normal or non-clinically significant pelvic examination.

               3. a mammogram that shows no sign of significant disease (can be performed within
                  previous 6 months prior to initial dose of study medication). Subjects must have
                  a BI-RADS 1 or 2 to enroll in the study. An incomplete mammogram result, i.e.
                  BI-RADS 0, is not acceptable. The site must obtain a copy of the official report
                  for the subject's study file, and it must be verified that the mammogram itself
                  is available if needed for additional assessment.

               4. a normal or non-clinically significant clinical breast examination. An acceptable
                  breast examination is defined as no masses or other findings identified that are
                  suspicious of malignancy.

               5. a normal Screening Papanicolaou (&quot;Pap&quot;) smear. (Subjects with findings of
                  atypical glandular cells [AGC], AGUS, ASCUS with high risk HPV type upon reflex
                  testing, LSIL, ASC-H, HSIL, dysplastic cells, or malignant cells must be excluded
                  from randomization.)

               6. an acceptable result from an evaluable Screening endometrial biopsy. The
                  endometrial biopsy reports by the two central pathologists at Screening must each
                  specify one of the following: proliferative endometrium; weakly proliferative
                  endometrium; disordered proliferative pattern; secretory endometrium; endometrial
                  tissue other (including benign, inactive or atrophic fragments of endometrial
                  epithelium, glands, stroma, etc); endometrial tissue insufficient for diagnosis;
                  no endometrium identified; or no tissue identified. However, at least one
                  pathologist must identify sufficient tissue to evaluate the biopsy. Additionally,
                  the endometrial biopsy reports by the two central pathologists of Other Findings
                  at Screening must each specify one of the following: endometrial polyp not
                  present; benign endometrial polyp; or polyp other. (See Exclusion criterion #27)

               7. a normal or non-clinically significant 12-lead ECG.

        <description>Mean change in frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms from Baseline to Week 4. The baseline was the most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to randomization. The weekly frequency of moderate to severe hot flushes was calculated from the daily diary record using a forward counting process of 7 day intervals beginning with the baseline date. Weekly frequency equals total number of moderate to severe hot flushes for the subject week.</description>

        <population>Randomized to the VMS Substudy, taken one dose of IP, and had at least 5 days of VMS diary data for baseline measurement of freq. &amp; severity of moderate to severe hot flushes, and had at least 4 days of VMS diary data for 1 on-treatment week of reporting freq. &amp; severity of hot flushes following initiation of IP.</population>

        <description>Endometrial biopsies centrally evaluated by 2 primary pathologists using criteria from Blaustein's Pathology text. Pathologists classified bx into 1 of following 3 categories: Cat.1: Non-endometrial malignancy/non-hyperplasia; Cat.2: Endometrial hyperplasia; Cat.3: Endometrial malignancy. Consensus reached when 2 primary pathologist agreed on any of above categories; if primary pathologists disagreed on presence of hyperplasia, result of 3rd pathologist was utilized and final decision regarding presence of hyperplasia was based on diagnosis of majority. If all 3 reads disparate, final diagnosis based on most severe dx. Incidence rate calculated as: I=A/B where I=incidence rate at M12 evaluation, A=all new subjects with biopsies positive for endometrial hyperplasia during study but post-Baseline, B=all subjects w/biopsies following M11 meeting criteria specified plus all subjects w/biopsies positive for endometrial hyperplasia by any pathologists before M11.</description>

          <description>Mean change in severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms at Baseline to mild, moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 12. The baseline was the most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to randomization. The severity score was derived as follows: mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3. Baseline Weekly Severity Score = (number of moderate hot flushes for 7 days) x 2 + (number of severe hot flushes for 7 days) x 3] / (total number of moderate to severe hot flushes over 7 days). On Treatment Weekly Severity Score = [(number of mild hot flushes for 7 days) x 1 + (number of moderate hot flushes for 7 days) x 2 + (number of severe hot flushes for 7 days) x 3] / (total number of mild, moderate and severe hot flushes over 7 days).</description>

          <description>Mean change in frequency of mild, moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms from Baseline to Week 12. The baseline was the most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to randomization. The weekly frequency of mild, moderate and severe hot flushes was calculated from the daily diary record using a forward counting process of 7 day intervals beginning with the baseline date. Weekly frequency equals total number of mild, moderate and severe hot flushes for the subject week.</description>

        <description>Mean change in frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms from Baseline to Week 12 for the respective CGI category. The CGI score is a seven point scale where subjects were asked to rate the total improvement, whether or not in her judgment it was due entirely to drug treatment, compared to her condition at admission to the study. Scale: Very much improved, Much improved, Minimally improved, No change, Minimally worse, Much worse, Very much worse. Results for the top two responses (Very Much Improved and Much Improved) and No Change or Worsening (Minimally worse, Much worse, Very much worse) were combined for each group and active treatment groups compare to placebo.</description>

        <description>Changes in Vasomotor Domain Score from Baseline to Week 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Vasomotor domain score is mean of = Q1,Q2, Q3, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Vasomotor Domain Score from Baseline to Month 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Vasomotor domain score is mean of = Q1,Q2, Q3, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Psychosocial Domain Score from Baseline to Month 6. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Psychosocial domain score is mean of = Q4 to Q10, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Physical Domain Score from Baseline to Week 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Physical domain score is mean of = Q11 to Q26, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Physical domain score is mean of = Q11 to Q26, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Sexual Domain Score from Baseline to Month 6. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Sexual domain score is mean of = Q27 to Q29, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Overall Scores from Baseline to Week 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The Overall Score is the mean of the 4 domain scores with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Overall Scores from Baseline to Month 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The Overall Score is the mean of the 4 domain scores with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Wk 12 in MOS Total Sleep Score as compared w/Placebo. MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over past 4 wks. Q1 scored on scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 self-reported hrs of sleep per night. Q3-12 scored 1-6 where 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Total score includes items Q1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 12. Scoring method: Answers to Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range (0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20. Answers to Q1, 4, &amp; 12 are rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_1_new =(MOS_1_old - 1) x 25; MOS_4_new =(MOS_4_old - 1) x 20; MOS_12_new=(MOS_12_old - 1) x 20. Total score= average of item scores; ranges =0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome.

MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over past 4 wks. Q1 scored on scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 self-reported hrs of sleep per night. Q3-12 scored 1-6 where 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Total score includes items Q1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 12. Scoring method: Answers to Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range (0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20. Answers to Q1, 4, &amp; 12 are rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_1_new =(MOS_1_old - 1) x 25; MOS_4_new =(MOS_4_old - 1) x 20; MOS_12_new=(MOS_12_old - 1) x 20. Total score= average of item scores; ranges =0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome. If any of individual questions used to obtain total score is missing, total score will be set to missing value.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Wk 12 in MOS Sleep Adequacy individual score as compared with Placebo. The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 weeks. Q1 is scored on a scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 is self-reported hours of sleep per night. Q3-Q12 are scored 1-6 ranging from 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Sleep Adequacy includes items Q4, Q12. Scoring method: Answers for Q4 and Q12 are reversed and rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_4_new = (6-MOS_4_old) x 20; MOS_12_new = (6-MOS_12_old) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range = 0 to 100, where higher score means better outcome.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Month 12 in MOS Sleep Adequacy individual score as compared with Placebo. The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 weeks. Q1 is scored on a scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 is self-reported hours of sleep per night. Q3-Q12 are scored 1-6 ranging from 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Sleep Adequacy includes items Q4, Q12. Scoring method: Answers for Q4 and Q12 are reversed and rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_4_new = (6-MOS_4_old) x 20; MOS_12_new = (6-MOS_12_old) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range = 0 to 100, where higher score means better outcome.</description>

Scoring method: Answers to Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range 0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20, for n=Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Answers to Q1, 4 &amp; 12 are rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_1_new =(MOS_1_old - 1) x 25; MOS_4_new =(MOS_4_old - 1) x 20; MOS_12_new=(MOS_12_old - 1) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range range=0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Month 12 in MOS Sleep Problems Index II individual score as compared with Placebo. The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 weeks. Q1 is scored on a scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 is self reported hours of sleep per night. Q3-12 scored 1-6 where 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Sleep Problems Index II items include Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q12. Scoring method: Answers to Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range 0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20, for n=Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Answers to Q1, 4 &amp; 12 are rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_1_new =(MOS_1_old - 1) x 25; MOS_4_new =(MOS_4_old - 1) x 20; MOS_12_new=(MOS_12_old - 1) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range range=0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome.</description>

The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items measuring 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 wks. Optimal sleep is based on Q2 (self-reported average hrs sleep per night in past 4 wks). Scoring method: hrs of sleep coded 0 (non-optimal) or 1 (optimal) where 1-6 hrs &amp; 9-23 hrs = 0, 7-8 hrs = 1. Change from BL: subject sleeps 7-8 hrs at BL &amp; 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at follow-up, change = -1; subject sleeps 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at BL &amp; 7-8 hrs at follow-up, change = +1; subject sleeps 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at BL &amp; 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at follow-up, change = 0. Mean change from BL: changes are summed to give the Net Total (equivalent to the number subjects w/ improved sleep hrs minus the number subjects w/ worsened sleep hrs), which is divided by the number of subjects to give the mean proportion of net change, where &gt;0 = overall improvement and &lt;0 = overall worsening in the study arm.</description>

It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Vasomotor domain score is mean of = Q1,Q2, Q3, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Vasomotor Domain Score from Baseline to Month 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Vasomotor domain score is mean of = Q1,Q2, Q3, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Psychosocial Domain Score from Baseline to Month 6. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Psychosocial domain score is mean of = Q4 to Q10, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Physical Domain Score from Baseline to Week 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Physical domain score is mean of = Q11 to Q26, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Physical Domain Score from Baseline to Month 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Physical domain score is mean of = Q11 to Q26, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Changes in Sexual Domain Score from Baseline to Month 6. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Sexual domain score is mean of = Q27 to Q29, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Change in Overall Scores from Baseline to Week 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The Overall Score is the mean of the 4 domain scores with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Change in Overall Scores from Baseline to Month 12. The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The Overall Score is the mean of the 4 domain scores with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Wk 12 in MOS Total Sleep Score as compared w/Placebo. MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over past 4 wks. Q1 scored on scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 self-reported hrs of sleep per night. Q3-12 scored 1-6 where 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Total score includes items Q1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 12. Scoring method: Answers to Q3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range (0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20. Answers to Q1, 4, &amp; 12 are rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_1_new =(MOS_1_old - 1) x 25; MOS_4_new =(MOS_4_old - 1) x 20; MOS_12_new=(MOS_12_old - 1) x 20. Total score= average of item scores; ranges =0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome. If any of individual questions used to obtain total score is missing, total score will be set to missing value.</description>

MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over past 4 wks. Q1 scored on scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 self-reported hrs of sleep per night. Q3-12 scored 1-6 where 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Sleep disturbance includes items Q1, Q3, Q7, Q8. Scoring method: Answer to Q1 is rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_1_new =(MOS_1_old - 1) x 25. Answers to Q3, 7, 8 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range(0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20.

Answers to Q3, 7, 8 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range(0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20. Score is average of item scores; score range=0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome.</description>

          <description>Change from Baseline to Wk 12 in MOS Sleep Adequacy individual score as compared with Placebo. The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 weeks. Q1 is scored on a scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 is self-reported hours of sleep per night. Q3-Q12 are scored 1-6 ranging from 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Sleep Adequacy includes items Q4, Q12. Scoring method: Answers for Q4 and Q12 are reversed and rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_4_new = (6-MOS_4_old) x 20; MOS_12_new = (6-MOS_12_old) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range = 0 to 100, where higher score means better outcome.</description>

          <description>Change from Baseline to Month 12 in MOS Sleep Adequacy individual score as compared with Placebo. The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items that measure 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 weeks. Q1 is scored on a scale 1-5: 1=0-15 min, 2=16-30 min...5=&gt;60 mins. Q2 is self-reported hours of sleep per night. Q3-Q12 are scored 1-6 ranging from 1=All of the time to 6=None of the time. Sleep Adequacy includes items Q4, Q12. Scoring method: Answers for Q4 and Q12 are reversed and rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_4_new = (6-MOS_4_old) x 20; MOS_12_new = (6-MOS_12_old) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range = 0 to 100, where higher score means better outcome.</description>

Scoring method: Answers to Q, 5, 7, 8, 9 are reversed &amp; rescaled to realign to be same direction and range (0 to 100 with 0=&quot;best possible&quot; &amp; 100=&quot;worst possible&quot; as follows: MOS_n_new = (6-MOS_n_old) x 20. Answers to Q4, &amp; 12 are rescaled to 0-100 as follows: MOS_4_new =(MOS_4_old - 1) x 20; MOS_12_new=(MOS_12_old - 1) x 20. Score is the average of item scores; score range range=0 to 100, where higher score means worse outcome.</description>

Optimal sleep is based on Q2 (self-reported average hrs sleep per night in past 4 wks). Scoring method: hrs of sleep coded 0 (non-optimal) or 1 (optimal) where 1-6 hrs &amp; 9-23 hrs = 0, 7-8 hrs = 1. Change from BL: subject sleeps 7-8 hrs at BL &amp; 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at follow-up, change = -1; subject sleeps 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at BL &amp; 7-8 hrs at follow-up, change = +1; subject sleeps 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at BL &amp; 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at follow-up, change = 0. Mean change from BL: changes are summed to give the Net Total (equivalent to the number subjects w/ improved sleep hrs minus the number subjects w/ worsened sleep hrs), which is divided by the number of subjects to give the mean proportion of net change, where &gt;0 = overall improvement and &lt;0 = overall worsening in the study arm.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline (BL) to Month 12 in MOS Optimal Sleep Score as compared with Placebo.The MOS-Sleep Self Report Questionnaire is composed of 12 items measuring 6 dimensions of sleep over the past 4 wks. Optimal sleep is based on Q2 (self-reported average hrs sleep per night in past 4 wks). Scoring method: hrs of sleep coded 0 (non-optimal) or 1 (optimal) where 1-6 hrs &amp; 9-23 hrs = 0, 7-8 hrs = 1. Change from BL: subject sleeps 7-8 hrs at BL &amp; 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at follow-up, change = -1; subject sleeps 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at BL &amp; 7-8 hrs at follow-up, change = +1; subject sleeps 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at BL &amp; 1-6 or 9-23 hrs at follow-up, change = 0. Mean change from BL: changes are summed to give the Net Total (equivalent to the number subjects w/ improved sleep hrs minus the number subjects w/ worsened sleep hrs), which is divided by the number of subjects to give the mean proportion of net change, where &gt;0 = overall improvement and &lt;0 = overall worsening in the study arm.</description>
