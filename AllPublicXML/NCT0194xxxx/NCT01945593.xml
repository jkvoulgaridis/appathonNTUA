          <title>Number of Participants With Inhibitory Antibodies to Factor VIII (FVIII)</title>
          <description>Inhibitory antibodies to Factor VIII were measured by the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay. Inhibitors had to be confirmed by 2 separate assessments within a 2 to 4 week period from the central laboratory.</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set (SAS) included all participants with at least 1 BAX 855 infusion. The analysis included participants that developed inhibitory antibodies (IA) to FVIII and participants that did not develop IA to FVIII and had 100 or more exposure days (ED) to BAX 855 across all studies and a FVIII inhibitory test result after the 100th ED.</population>

          <description>The participant or caregiver rated the overall treatment response at 24 (+/- 2) hours after the initiation of treatment using a 4-point efficacy rating scale as Excellent: Full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion and no additional infusion is required for the control of bleeding; Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion and possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution; Fair: Slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion and required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution and None: No improvement or condition worsens.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants with at least 1 BAX 855 infusion. Here ‘N’ refers to the number of participants evaluable for this outcome.</population>

        <description>An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (eg, rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an investigational product (IP), whether or not considered causally related to the IP. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose met one or more of the following criteria: outcome was fatal/resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or resulted in prolongation of an existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; was a medically important event.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bleed Severity</title>
        <description>Hemophilia symptom (haemo-SYM) questionnaire has two subscales: pain and bleed. It was used to asses the bleed severity for participants &gt;=18 years of age as: severity of spontaneous bleeding in my joints (unrelated to injury or activity), spontaneous bleeding in my muscles (unrelated to injury or activity), prolonged bleeding after injury in spite of treatment, intense pain because of bleeding event, joint pain due to active bleed and bleeding during personal hygiene routine, blood in my urine, nose bleeds and assigned a score of 0=Absent, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe and 5=very severe. The score was determined as (mean score/5)*100 where mean score is the mean of the available results in the particular subscale. Higher scores on the Haemo-SYM indicate more severe symptoms. Therefore, negative change scores indicate that symptoms have improved. Here 'n' refers to the number of participants evaluable for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>HRQoL in participants aged &gt;=14 years was measured using the SF-36 questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into 8 domains and scored as:
physical functioning (1=yes, limited a lot to 3=no, not limited at all), role-physical (1=all of the time to 5=none of the time), bodily pain (1=very severe to 6=none), general health (1=poor to 5=excellent), vitality (1=none of the time to 5=all of the time), social functioning (1=all of the time: to 5=none of the time), role emotional (1=all of the time to 5=none of the time) and mental health (1=all of the time to 5=none of the time). The score for each domain is then to be transformed to a 0-100 range as [(actual raw score-lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range]*100. Positive change scores indicate improved HRQoL. in the below table 'FDR' indicates fixed dose regimen, 'PK-tr' indicates pharmacokinetically tailored regimen and 'n' refers to the number of participants evaluable for this endpoint.</description>

        <description>HRQoL in participants aged &lt;14 years was measured using the PedsQL. It capture data for the following domains: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, school functioning, psychosocial functioning, physical health and a total score. Each question of the PedsQL was scored as Never: 100, almost never: 75, sometimes: 50, often: 25, almost always: 0. The mean of the individual question scores was calculated. Lower scores on the PedsQL indicating worse HRQoL. Here, FDR refers to fixed dose regimen, PK-t R refers to PK-tailored regimen. Here 'n' refers to the number of participants evaluable for this endpoint. Here 'n' refers to the number of participants evaluable for this endpoint.</description>
