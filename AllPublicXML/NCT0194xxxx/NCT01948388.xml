    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the utilization of two doses of
      corticotrophin ( ACTH) as a treatment in patients with early onset rheumatoid arthritis as an
      alternative to conventional steroid therapy by evaluating the change from baseline in the
      clinical findings as well as the structural findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
      Corticotrophin (ACTH) may prevent the well documented structural progression damage in RA
      patients using disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy alone.

      Acthar Gel Respository Injection, Corticotrophin( ACTH) administered to newly diagnosed
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis in conjunction with methotrexate, folllowed by a 24 week
      follow-up period. There will be a total of twenty (20) patients and two (2) treatment groups

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of the use of 2 doses of corticotrophin (ACTH) as a treatment in patients with early onset rheumatoid arthritis as an alternative to conventional steroid therapy by evaluating the change from baseline in the clinical findings as measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores. The CDAI is calculated at the specified time points using the formula: CDAI = SJC(28) + TJC(28) + PGA + EGA SJC(28): Swollen 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) Interpretation: A lower CDAI score from Baseline would mean improvement in disease activity and an increase in CDAI score from Baseline would mean an increase in disease activity or a worsening in disease activity. Scores: 0.0-2.8 = Range for Remission; 2.9-10.0 = Range for Low disease activity; 10.1-22.0 Range for Moderate disease activity; 22.1-76 Range for High disease activity.Total range is from 0-100, with the high scores representing high disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the clinical findings as measured by the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) versus the structural findings as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Improvement is measured as a reduction in CDAI score from Baseline to Month 6 and improvement in MRI is regression of erosions, oseitis and synovitis at month 6. Norman MRI score is zero (0).
CDAI: 0.0-2.8 remission; 2.9-10.0 low disease activity; 10.1-22 moderate disease activity; 22.1-76 high disease activity. A decrease in CDAI score is improvement</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score</title>
        <description>To evaluate the effect of the use of 2 doses of corticotrophin (ACTH) as a treatment in patients with early onset rheumatoid arthritis as an alternative to conventional steroid therapy by evaluating the change from baseline in the clinical findings as measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores. The CDAI is calculated at the specified time points using the formula: CDAI = SJC(28) + TJC(28) + PGA + EGA SJC(28): Swollen 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) Interpretation: A lower CDAI score from Baseline would mean improvement in disease activity and an increase in CDAI score from Baseline would mean an increase in disease activity or a worsening in disease activity. Scores: 0.0-2.8 = Range for Remission; 2.9-10.0 = Range for Low disease activity; 10.1-22.0 Range for Moderate disease activity; 22.1-76 Range for High disease activity.Total range is from 0-100, with the high scores representing high disease activity.</description>

Improvement is measured as a reduction in CDAI score from Baseline to Month 6 and improvement in MRI is regression of erosions, oseitis and synovitis at month 6. Norman MRI score is zero (0).
CDAI: 0.0-2.8 remission; 2.9-10.0 low disease activity; 10.1-22 moderate disease activity; 22.1-76 high disease activity. A decrease in CDAI score is improvement</description>
