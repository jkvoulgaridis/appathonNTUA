      1. Exploration of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation（rTMS）on working memory and
           cognitive impairment symptoms of schizophrenia treatment and mechanism.

        2. Analysis of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation stimulation to
           the improvement of negative symptoms and psychotic symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized double-blind sham-controlled trial for 4 weeks. Patients with
      schizophrenia were treated with 20-Hz rTMS for 4 weeks to the left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (added to the ongoing treatment). Negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for
      the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative symptom scale
      (PANSS).The auditory steady state responses (ASSR) were obtained for the assessment of gamma
      oscillation.And cognitive symptoms were assessed by MATRICS cognitive test battery (MCCB)
      Chinese version and n-back task.

    <measure>The Change in the Severity of Negative Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of negative symptoms were measured with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).The SANS contains 30 particular items divided into 5 symptomatological domains: 1) affective flattening and/or blunting, 2) alogia, 3) avolition and/or apathy, 4) anhedonia, and 5) impaired attention. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (severe) with a total scoring range of 0 to 150. Higher scores indicate more impairment.The PANSS contains 30 particular items divided into 3 subscores: 1)positive, 2) negative, and 3) general subscore. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme) with a total scoring range of 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate more impairment. The primary outcomes were the changes in the severity of negative symptoms as measured with SANS total score and PANSS negative subscore after 4 weeks of intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) in Chinese Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MCCB in Chinese Version includes 9 tasks across 7 domains, and a composite score, including Processing Speed (Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia Symbol Coding, Animal Fluency, Trails A), Attention (Continuous Performance Test), Working Memory (WMS-III Spatial Span), Verbal Learning (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised), Visual Learning (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised), Problem Solving (Neuropsychological Assessment Battery), and Social Cognition (Mayer-Salovey- Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test).The results are reported as T scores with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Event-related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alterations in gamma-band ASSR have been thought to be the most robust finding of abnormal neural oscillations in patients with schizophrenia. EEG data were acquired using a 64-electrode cap and alternating current BrainAmp amplifiers (Brain Products GmbH, Germany). We used EEGLAB to perform time-frequency analysis with a short-term Fourier transformation, and then calculated ERSP.</description>

Stimulation will be delivered at 20 Hz with 100 stimulation trains of 20 stimuli each (i.e., 2000 stimuli) and an inter-train interval of 9 sec. Treatment will be applied in sequential order to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Intervention: Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</description>

        <title>The Change in the Severity of Negative Symptoms</title>
        <description>The assessment of negative symptoms were measured with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).The SANS contains 30 particular items divided into 5 symptomatological domains: 1) affective flattening and/or blunting, 2) alogia, 3) avolition and/or apathy, 4) anhedonia, and 5) impaired attention. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (severe) with a total scoring range of 0 to 150. Higher scores indicate more impairment.The PANSS contains 30 particular items divided into 3 subscores: 1)positive, 2) negative, and 3) general subscore. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme) with a total scoring range of 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate more impairment. The primary outcomes were the changes in the severity of negative symptoms as measured with SANS total score and PANSS negative subscore after 4 weeks of intervention.</description>

            <title>Active rTMS</title>
            <description>Active treatment will be delivered at an intensity that is 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT). Stimulation will be delivered at 20 Hz with 100 stimulation trains of 20 stimuli each (i.e., 2000 stimuli) and an inter-train interval of 9 sec. Treatment will be applied in sequential order to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Intervention: Device: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: The MagPro X100 is connected to a Magnetic Coil which transfers the magnetic stimulation to the tissue. The original coils MC-B65 can be used with the MagPro X100.</description>

            <description>Sham rTMS stimulation will be delivered using the same stimulation parameters and at the site of active treatment, but the coil will be reversed. This method produces sound and some somatic sensation (e.g., contraction of scalp muscles) similar to those of active stimulation, but with minimal direct brain effects.

EEG data were acquired using a 64-electrode cap and alternating current BrainAmp amplifiers (Brain Products GmbH, Germany).
