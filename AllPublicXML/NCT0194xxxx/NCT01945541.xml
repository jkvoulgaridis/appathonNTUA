  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a recently developed device, which measures body
      composition (i.e. the water content of the body) in the perioperative setting. Specifically
      the investigators will test the hypothesis, that extracellular water content after surgery
      correlates to the amount of intraoperative infusion and positive fluid balance. Furthermore
      the investigators will test, if preoperative evaluation of body water helps to determine
      intraoperative fluid requirements and to guide fluid administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery receive intravenous fluids during the procedure.
      The amount of administered fluid depends on the type of surgery, cardiovascular stability and
      intraoperative losses like hemorrhage. Fluid overload as well as hypohydration might be
      detrimental and might adversely effect outcome after surgery. Specifically overhydration
      results in significant weight gain, tissue edema and increased morbidity. Technically
      assisted assessment of volume status before surgery may be useful to direct intraoperative
      fluid administration and to prevent postoperative volume overload. As a prerequisite the
      investigators will test a recently developed whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy device to
      determine the pre-to postoperative fluid distribution. This body composition monitor (BCM,
      Fresenius Medical Care, Germany) separates between extracellular and intracellular fluid
      volume non-invasively by applying a frequency sweep from 3-1000 kilohertz through the entire
      patient via electrodes placed on the wrist and ankle.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that

        1. the amount of administered fluid correlates with the amount of overhydration measured
           postoperatively.

        2. that preoperative BCM measurements and thus information about the preoperative hydration
           state might help to guide fluidmanagement and to reduce the amount of over/
           hypohydration postoperatively.
