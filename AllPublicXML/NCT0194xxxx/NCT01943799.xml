  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS-4774 in
      adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) viral infection who have been virally suppressed with
      an oral antiviral (OAV) medication.

    <description>The change from baseline to Week 24 in HBsAg was analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included included treatment, HBsAg baseline level (≤ 1000 IU/mL or &gt; 1000 IU/mL), HBeAg baseline status (positive or negative), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and visit as a repeated measure.</description>

The participant was assigned to Group A if the average was 0, or Group B if the average was greater than 0 and no more than 6 YU, or Group C if the average was greater than 6 YU and no more than 25 YU, or Group D if the average was greater than 25 YU.</desc>
