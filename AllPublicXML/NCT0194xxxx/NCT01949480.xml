  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound
      assisted paravertebral block placement versus traditional &quot;blind&quot; technique for postoperative
      analgesia following thoracotomy or visually assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a difference between paravertebral
      block performed with ultrasound assistance and paravertebral block performed with traditional
      technique in terms of twenty - four hour hydromorphone (dilaudid) consumption and visual
      analogue pain scores at rest or with deep breathing at twenty - four hours. This study will
      determine if ultrasound technique used for placement of paravertebral catheter facilitates
      safety of paravertebral catheterization and improves therapeutic effect of paravertebral
      blockade for pain control after thoracotomy. The investigators will also examine if
      ultrasound assisted paravertebral blockade improves pulmonary status in post-thoracotomy
      patient.

          <description>After final needle placement, a hanging drop technique will be used to rule out intrapleural placement while the patient inhales and exhales deeply. After correct needle placement, 10 mL of 0.5% Ropivacaine will be injected incrementally through each needle after negative aspiration, followed by insertion of the nerve block catheter to a depth 5 cm beyond the tip of the needle. An additional 10 mL of 0.5% Ropivacaine will then be injected in 5 mL increments with negative aspiration in between, through the catheter yielding a total activation dose of 20 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine. The catheter will be secured with Steri-strips and a transparent occlusive dressing.
