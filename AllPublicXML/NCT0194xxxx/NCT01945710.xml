      Study E7389-E044-112 is a Phase 1 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of eribulin-liposomal formulation (E7389-LF) in patients with solid
      tumors. This dose-escalation study will determine the maximum tolerated dose, dosing
      schedules tested, the dose schedule regimen with a more favorable tolerability profile, and a
      preliminary indication of efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance
      to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments),
      multicenter, 2-part, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of
      what the body does to a drug) of eribulin-LF administered intravenously to patients with
      solid tumors. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days (Schedule 1) or 28 days (Schedule 1a or
      2). Part 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics and safety.
      Three to 6 new patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the
      starting dose and subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of eribulin-LF). Enrollment
      in each cohort will be staggered; the second and third participant in every cohort will not
      be dosed until the first patient in that cohort completes 2 weeks of Cycle 1. If no
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed during the first 2 week of Cycle 1 in the
      first patient, the second and third patients in the cohort will initiate treatment.
      Enrollment will be first initiated into cohort 1 of Schedule 1 (dosing on Day 1 of 21 day
      cycle). Interim analysis will be conducted upon completion of this cohort. The following
      decisions will be made based upon the results of the interim analysis 1) proceed with
      escalating to next dose level (cohort 2) of Schedule 1 (dosing on Day 1 of 21 day cycle) and
      initiate cohort 1 of Schedule 2 (dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 of 28 day cycle), or 2)
      discontinue plans to evaluate Schedule 2 and initiate Schedule 1a (dosing on Day 1 of 28 day
      cycle).

      After the last patient in each cohort completes Cycle 1, the safety for DLT determination
      will be evaluated and a decision will be made on whether to escalate the dose in a new cohort
      of 3 to 6 new patients. Dose escalation will halt when the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      reached. The total number of patients to be enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level
      at which the DLT will be achieved. After MTD for each schedule is determined, patients will
      be enrolled into Expansion Part of the study to confirm safety and tolerability of each
      dosing schedule. Nine to 12 patients will be treated with MTD for each schedule for 6 cycles.
      The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 months.

    <time_frame>Schedule 1: Cycle 1 (21 days); Schedule 2: Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1/6 participants experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. MTD was determined by summarizing the number and percentage of participants with DLTs for the first cycle, by study dosing schedule, initial dosing level and overall for the dose escalation part. For participants who continued to Cycle 2, the DLTs which occurred from 1st dose up to the day before Day 1 of Cycle 2 were counted. For participants who discontinued before Cycle 2, the DLTs which occurred from 1st dose up to Day 21 (Schedule 1) or Day 28 (Schedule 2) of Cycle 1 were counted. DLTs were evaluated and graded based on the National Cancer Institutes (NCI)'s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

             ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver
             metastases) AND participant also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific
             ALP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of

             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository], a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or
             have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study
             period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently abstinent, the
             participant must agree to use a double barrier method with spermicide as described
             above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after
             study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have
             been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks

             30 days after study drug discontinuation.

         10. Male participants must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they
             and their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Eribulin-LF</title>
        <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1/6 participants experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. MTD was determined by summarizing the number and percentage of participants with DLTs for the first cycle, by study dosing schedule, initial dosing level and overall for the dose escalation part. For participants who continued to Cycle 2, the DLTs which occurred from 1st dose up to the day before Day 1 of Cycle 2 were counted. For participants who discontinued before Cycle 2, the DLTs which occurred from 1st dose up to Day 21 (Schedule 1) or Day 28 (Schedule 2) of Cycle 1 were counted. DLTs were evaluated and graded based on the National Cancer Institutes (NCI)'s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Eribulin-LF</title>
        <description>Safety was assessed by the monitoring and recording of all adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs (SAEs), regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs, electrocardiograms; and the performance of physical examinations. For each row category, a participant with two or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. Treatment-related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug and TEAEs with a missing relationship to study drug.</description>

Blood samples for Schedule 2 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Day 15 and Cycle 3/Day 1 and Day 15 predose, 15 min after the SOI, 5 min after the EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11. Some participants followed a different pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment schedule prior to protocol amendment 3. Plasma concentrations of eribulin-LF were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of Cmax, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed as nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

        <description>Blood samples for Schedule 1 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Cycle 3/Day 1 predose, 15 min after the SOI, 5 min after the EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9, and Day 11. Blood samples for Schedule 2 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Day 15 and Cycle 3/Day 1 and Day 15 predose, 15 min after the SOI, 5 min after the EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11. Some participants followed a different PK assessment schedule prior to protocol amendment 3. Plasma concentrations of eribulin-LF were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of Tmax, which was then summarized as the median and full range for all participants and expressed as hours.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for Schedule 1 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Cycle 3/Day 1 predose, 15 min after SOI, 5 min after EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9, and Day 11. Blood samples for Schedule 2 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Day 15 and Cycle 3/Day 1 and Day 15 predose, 15 min after the SOI, 5 min after the EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11. Plasma concentrations of eribulin-LF were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of AUC(0-inf), which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in ng*hr/mL.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for Schedule 1 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Cycle 3/Day 1 predose, 15 min after SOI, 5 min after EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9, and Day 11. Blood samples for Schedule 2 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Day 15 and Cycle 3/Day 1 and Day 15 predose, 15 min after SOI, 5 min after EOI, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11. Some participants followed a different PK assessment schedule prior to protocol amendment 3. Plasma concentrations of eribulin-LF were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS method. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of CLr, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in liters/hour (L/hr).</description>

        <description>Urinalysis was performed at Screening, Baseline, Cycle 1/Day 15, and each study visit of every cycle thereafter. If urinalysis suggested a urinary tract infection, or if clinically indicated, a urine microscopy, culture, and sensitivity was to be performed at the institution's laboratory. If urine protein was ≥ 2+ on urinalysis, then a 24-hour urine collection was to be done to quantify the 24-hour urine protein excretion. The samples were analyzed for the amount of eribulin in the urine using liquid LC/MS method of analysis. Urine PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of fe, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in percentage of eribulin-LF.</description>

        <description>BOR to treatment was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. BOR was the best confirmed response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), or not evaluable (NE), recorded from the start of eribulin-LF until disease progression/recurrence or death. CR; disappearance of all target lesions for at least 1 month. PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD; at least 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. SD; PR failed to be achieved in the overall response assessment and there was no PD observed at the end of 6 cycles or later after starting eribulin-LF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1 criteria or target lesions assessed by magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) scans, as determined by independent radiologic review. BOR of CR was confirmed by a subsequent CR assessment at least 4 weeks later. BOR of PR was confirmed by a subsequent CR or PR assessment at least 4 weeks later. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. The null hypothesis ORR was less than or equal to 10% was tested using 1-sided exact test of a single proportion, at 1-sided 0.05 level. ORR was presented with corresponding 2-sided, 95% confidence interval (CI). ORR=CR+PR.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of treatment start until progressive disease or death from any cause in the absence of progressive disease. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study), recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions as assessed by IRR using RECIST v1.1. The duration of PFS was calculated as end date minus date of first drug plus 1, based on assessments by the site Investigator. PFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% Cl.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Shift From Baseline Category to the Indicated Worst Post-Baseline Category</title>
        <description>The effects of eribulin-LF on cardiovascular repolarization were evaluated via 24-hour, 12-lead continuous Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in Cycle 1, Day 1 for Schedule 1 and Day 1 and Day 15 of Schedule 2. Individual ECGs were extracted in triplicate from the Holter recordings at specified time points and were evaluated by a central laboratory. QT intervals were measured from Lead II and were corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Fridericia's (QTcF) and Bazett's (QTcB) correction factors. The primary QTc parameter was QTcF. Secondary parameters (QTcB, QT, QRS, and hazard ratio/heart rate (HR)) and waveforms (T-waves) were evaluated. BL= Baseline, PBL = post-Baseline, A,NCS = abnormal, not clinically significant, A, CS = abnormal, clinically significant</description>
