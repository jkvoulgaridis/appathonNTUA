      This Phase 3 clinical trial is an essential step in the evaluation of an investigational
      medication to see if it may be useful in treating prostate cancer. The purpose of the SPARTAN
      study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the investigational medication to placebo
      in delaying prostate cancer from spreading to other parts of the body. A placebo is a pill
      that looks like the investigational medication but does not contain any active medication, a
      dummy pill.

      Phase 3 studies are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug
      has been obtained in previous Phase 2 studies. These studies are intended to gather the
      additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall
      benefit-risk relationship of the drug.

      Study participants will take the oral investigational medication daily. One cycle of study
      treatment lasts 4 weeks or 28 days. The number of cycles will depend on how you and your
      cancer respond to the study medication.

      In order for the researchers to evaluate and compare the study results, there are two
      different study groups. Study participants will be randomly (like flipping a coin) assigned
      to one of these groups:

        -  One group will receive their current treatment along with the investigational medication

        -  One group will receive their current medications along with a placebo

      The investigational medication will be given to 2 out of every 3 study participants. Neither
      you nor the study staff will know which group you are in. However, in case of a medical
      emergency, your study doctor can quickly find out which treatment group you are in.

      All participants will continue to receive their current treatment along with either the
      investigational medication or a placebo. The selections will be random, and you may remain on
      investigational treatment until your disease worsens, or until significant side effects occur
      or you can no longer tolerate treatment.

    <measure>Metastasis-Free Survival (MFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 43 Months</time_frame>
    <description>MFS was defined as the time from randomization to the time of first evidence of BICR-confirmed bone or soft tissue distant metastasis or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. The MFS data for participants without metastasis or death were performed for US or ex-US regulatory purposes. Radiographic scans (bone scans and computerized tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) were performed for detection of metastasis throughout the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Metastasis (TTM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 43 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to metastasis (TTM) was defined as the time from randomization to the time of the scan that showed first evidence of BICR-confirmed radiographically detected bone or soft tissue distant metastasis. The TTM data for participants without metastasis were performed for US or ex-US regulatory purposes. Radiographic scans (bone scans and CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) were performed for detection of metastasis throughout the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 43 Months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS defined as time from randomization to first documentation of BICR-confirmed radiographic progressive disease (PD) (development of distant/local/regional metastasis)/death due to any cause whichever occurred first. PFS data for participants without loco-regional disease were performed for US/ex-US regulatory purposes. Radiographic scans (bone scans and CT/MRI of chest,abdomen,pelvis) performed for detection of metastasis throughout study. PD based on RECIST v1.1; Subjects with one measurable lesion, At least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference smallest sum on study. In addition, sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter(mm). Also, appearance of one/more new lesions was also considered PD. Subjects with non-measurable disease as per CT/MRI scans, unequivocal progression/appearance of one or more new lesions was considered PD. For new bone lesions detected on bone scans, second imaging (CT/MRI) was required to confirm PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Symptomatic Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 43 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to symptomatic progression was defined as the time from randomization to documentation in the CRF of any of the following (whichever occurred earlier): a) development of a skeletal-related event (pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or need for surgical intervention or radiation therapy to the bone); b) pain progression or worsening of disease-related symptoms requiring initiation of a new systemic anti-cancer therapy; or c) development of clinically significant symptoms due to loco-regional tumor progression requiring surgical intervention or radiation therapy.</description>

        <description>Time to metastasis (TTM) was defined as the time from randomization to the time of the scan that showed first evidence of BICR-confirmed radiographically detected bone or soft tissue distant metastasis. The TTM data for participants without metastasis were performed for US or ex-US regulatory purposes. Radiographic scans (bone scans and CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) were performed for detection of metastasis throughout the study.</description>

        <description>PFS defined as time from randomization to first documentation of BICR-confirmed radiographic progressive disease (PD) (development of distant/local/regional metastasis)/death due to any cause whichever occurred first. PFS data for participants without loco-regional disease were performed for US/ex-US regulatory purposes. Radiographic scans (bone scans and CT/MRI of chest,abdomen,pelvis) performed for detection of metastasis throughout study. PD based on RECIST v1.1; Subjects with one measurable lesion, At least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference smallest sum on study. In addition, sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter(mm). Also, appearance of one/more new lesions was also considered PD. Subjects with non-measurable disease as per CT/MRI scans, unequivocal progression/appearance of one or more new lesions was considered PD. For new bone lesions detected on bone scans, second imaging (CT/MRI) was required to confirm PD.</description>
