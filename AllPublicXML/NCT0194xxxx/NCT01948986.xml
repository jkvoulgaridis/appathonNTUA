        <title>Apparent Clearance (CL/F) for Plasma Ertugliflozin</title>
        <description>CL/F is a calculation of the rate at which a drug is removed from the body via renal, hepatic and other clearance pathways, expressed as volume (milliliters) per unit of time (minutes). Blood samples were taken at pre-dose up to 96 hours post-dose, from which the concentration of ertugliflozin was determined. Geometric Coefficient of Variation was reported as a percent.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were taken at pre-dose up to 96 hours post-dose, from which the concentration of ertugliflozin was determined.
CLr is Renal Clearance (Ae96 / AUC96), where Ae96 is the cumulative amount of drug recovered unchanged in urine to 96 hours post dose and AUC96 was the area under the concentration-time profile form time 0 to 96 hours. Geometric Coefficient of Variation was reported as a percent.</description>

          <title>Renal Clearance (CLr) for Urinary Glucuronide Metabolite PF-06685948</title>
          <description>Urine samples were taken at pre-dose up to 96 hours post-dose, from which the concentration of ertugliflozin was determined.
CLr is Renal Clearance (Ae96 / AUC96), where Ae96 is the cumulative amount of drug recovered unchanged in urine to 96 hours post dose and AUC96 was the area under the concentration-time profile form time 0 to 96 hours. Blood samples were taken at pre-dose up to 96 hours post-dose, from which the concentration of glucuronide metabolite PF-06685948 was determined. Geometric Coefficient of Variation was reported as a percent.</description>
          <population>The analysis population was defined as all treated participants who had at least one concentration measurement for CLr.</population>
