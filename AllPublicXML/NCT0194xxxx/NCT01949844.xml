  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in a patient population with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) as
      defined by the presence of a prior abnormal nuclear (PET/SPECT) myocardial perfusion scan. In
      this study design, PET/SPECT will serve as the comparative standard for presence of
      myocardial ischemia. We intend to determine the accuracy of an improved magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) technique for detection of myocardial ischemia in subjects with suspected CAD.

      This is not a study to specifically evaluate the efficacy or safety of the drugs but rather
      the diagnostic performance of the improved cardiac MRI procedure.

      A total of two imaging protocols will be used as &quot;protocol options&quot; in this study (only one
      of the protocols will be used for each enrolled subject): (1) &quot;Two-day protocol,&quot; which
      involves MRI of subjects who have had a recent abnormal PET/SPECT study and includes an
      optional second-day visit; (2) &quot;One-day protocol,&quot; which involves the subjects undergoing
      stress myocardial perfusion SPECT and MRI in the same day.

      Two blinded readers will interpret MR and SPECT/PET studies by consensus to assess the
      presence of perfusion deficits at stress and rest.

    <description>This pilot study has a single arm/group of subjects with suspected CAD based on the following inclusion criteria:
Prior nuclear myocardial perfusion scan (PET/SPECT) with a visual interpretation of definitely abnormal, or prior myocardial infarction; or,
Clinically stable individuals with suspected coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary angiography.
The study protocol involved only a myocardial perfusion MRI procedure for detection of ischemia (perfusion deficits) using an improved protocol with the administration of a vasodilator drug (Regadenoson/Lexiscan®) and gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent (Optimark®; dose: 0.2 mmol/kg). Lexiscan® was used off-label as a vasodilator drug during the MRI scan (0.4 mg/5mL) supplied by the manufacturer, Astellas Pharma U.S.</description>

    <description>Lexiscan® is being used off-label. The FDA Issued IND # is 119898. For the cardiac MRI, Lexiscan® will be used at the same dosage and administration as prescribed in the package insert - 5 mL (0.4 mg regadenoson) as packaged and supplied by the manufacturer, Astellas Pharma U.S., in single-use pre-filled syringes administered by rapid intravenous injection, followed immediately by saline flush.</description>

          <description>This pilot study involved a single arm/group of subjects with suspected CAD who were recruited to undergo an improved cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol with vasodilator stress (Regadenoson) for detection of myocardial perfusion defects. All subjects were recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: (a) prior nuclear myocardial perfusion scan with a visual interpretation of definitely abnormal, or prior myocardial infarction; or, (b) clinically stable individuals with suspected coronary artery disease on the basis of invasive or noninvasive coronary angiography.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This pilot study did not have a control/placebo arm and did not involve evaluation of the efficacy of a drug but rather the performance of an improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique with reduced image artifacts.</limitations_and_caveats>
