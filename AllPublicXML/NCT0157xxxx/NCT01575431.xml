  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prospectively investigate the relationship of circulating
      endothelial progenitor cells at time of percutaneous coronary intervention to the subsequent
      development of in-stent restenosis or progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research on stem cells has identified a population of bone marrow-derived cells, called
      circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), that incorporate into sites of
      neovascularization and are home to sites of endothelial denudation thus contributing to the
      maintenance of vascular homeostasis.

      Although extensive work has been conducted to verify if EPCs impairment plays a key role in
      coronary atherogenesis, it is still matter of debate if the extension and severity of
      coronary artery disease are associated with reduced or increased numbers of EPCs, as it
      remains unclear if these cells exert favorable or unfavorable effects at sites of
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). One should consider, however, that most previous
      investigations have been hampered by discordant definitions of EPCs and by different timing
      of EPCs sampling, thus determining much uncertainty on the role of EPCs in restenosis and
      atherosclerosis progression. Furthermore, development of de novo lesions and post-PCI
      restenosis, which are pathophysiologically dissimilar, have not been examined concomitantly
      and serially over time.

      Accordingly, the aim of this study is to carry out the first prospective assessment of the
      significance of subpopulations of circulating EPCs in the subsequent occurrence of restenosis
      or progression of coronary atherosclerosis after PCI. To this end, a pool of EPCs subtypes
      that are suggested to play some role in atherosclerosis is measured in a homogenous
      population of candidates to PCI. At variance with previous work, counts of EPCs are obtained
      in baseline conditions before PCI in order to avoid the confounding effect that the procedure
      exerts on EPCs.
