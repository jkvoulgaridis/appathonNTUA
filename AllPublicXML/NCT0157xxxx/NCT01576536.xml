  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test whether genetic variation in the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor
      affects diurnal variation in platelet aggregation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a marked diurnal fluctuation in the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and
      sudden death, with peak incidences occurring in the early morning. Platelet aggregation has
      also been shown to increase in the early morning. The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that alpha 2a-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) genetic variation, specifically haplotype 4,
      affects platelet aggregation. The investigators will compare diurnal platelet aggregation in
      haplotype 4 subjects with subjects in the other haplotype families. In addition, the
      investigators will compare platelet aggregation after the cold pressor test in haplotype 4
      with the other haplotype families. If there are no differences among haplotypes, then the
      haplotypes will be combined to analyze.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Healthy young subjects studied, thus findings may not apply to different populations. Plasma catecholamines are an indirect measure of sympathetic activity--norepinephrine spillover would be more precise, but is technically demanding, not feasible.</limitations_and_caveats>
