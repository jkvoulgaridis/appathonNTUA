    <description>The potential recommended dose (PRD) will be determined following the assessment of efficacy and safety parameters based on the first three doses of Sotatercept administered, up to at least 21 days following the first dose, for all doses evaluated. The PRD of Sotatercept will be defined as the highest dose level at which no more than one out of six subjects experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The recommended dose of Sotatercept will be defined based on the review of the efficacy and safety parameters as well as dose modification data. The efficacy parameter is defined as: - for transfusion dependent B-Thalassemia major and intermedia : the reduction of transfusion burden by ≥ 20% compared to the calculated baseline transfusion burden to each subject ; - for non-transfusion dependent B-Thalassemia intermedia subjects : increase in Hgb level by ≥ 1 g/dl compared to the baseline Hgb, sustained for 12 weeks.</description>
