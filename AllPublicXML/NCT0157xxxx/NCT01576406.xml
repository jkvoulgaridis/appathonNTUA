    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the potential effect of hepatic impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of crizotinib in advanced cancer patients. Advanced cancer
      patients with mild, moderate or severe liver dysfunction as well as patients with normal
      liver function will be enrolled in this study.

    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. In case of target lesions CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and in case nodal disease included in the sum of target lesions. The nodes decreased to normal size (&lt;10 mm). In case of non-target lesions disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses were those who persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response.</description>

    <description>DR was defined as the time from date of first documentation of CR or PR to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. In case of target lesions CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and in case nodal disease included in the sum of target lesions. The nodes decreased to normal size (&lt;10 mm). In case of non-target lesions disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Objective tumor progression as per RECIST version 1.1 was defined as &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment started, or appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. In case of target lesions CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and in case nodal disease included in the sum of target lesions. The nodes decreased to normal size (&lt;10 mm). In case of non-target lesions disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses were those who persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, every 8 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to end of treatment (up to 728 days)</time_frame>
        <population>Response-evaluable population was defined as all participants in the safety analysis population who had an adequate baseline tumor assessment.</population>

          <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</title>
          <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. In case of target lesions CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and in case nodal disease included in the sum of target lesions. The nodes decreased to normal size (&lt;10 mm). In case of non-target lesions disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses were those who persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response.</description>
          <population>Response-evaluable population was defined as all participants in the safety analysis population who had an adequate baseline tumor assessment.</population>

        <description>DR was defined as the time from date of first documentation of CR or PR to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. In case of target lesions CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and in case nodal disease included in the sum of target lesions. The nodes decreased to normal size (&lt;10 mm). In case of non-target lesions disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Objective tumor progression as per RECIST version 1.1 was defined as &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment started, or appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. DR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
