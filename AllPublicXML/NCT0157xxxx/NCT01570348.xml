      This phase II trial studies how well giving a donor bone marrow transplant (BMT) works in
      treating patients with refractory Crohn's Disease. We will select patients with severe
      Crohn's Disease and active inflammation despite the best medical and surgical treatments.
      These patients must be healthy enough to undergo a transplantation procedure. They cannot
      have an active infection, and their heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver cannot be failing. The
      transplant procedure starts with chemotherapy and a small dose of radiation, to weaken a
      patient's immune system so that it will accept bone marrow cells from another person. After
      that other person's bone marrow cells are given to the patient, immune suppressive medicines
      are given to prevent the new cells from being rejected and to stop those cells from damaging
      the patient. After the new donor cells start to work, blood counts will rise and the new
      immune system will start to grow. During this time, there is a risk of infection. Antibiotics
      and anti-viral drugs will be given to prevent infection. When the new donor cells are
      well-established, immune suppressive medicines are discontinued. We will examine parts of the
      intestine that were inflamed before the start of the transplant procedure, to be sure the
      Crohn's Disease has disappeared after the transplant. Patients will be formally evaluated for
      Crohn's activity at around 100 days after transplant, and yearly after that for 5 years.

      BACKGROUND:

      There is strong evidence for genetic susceptibility to Crohn's Disease (CD), with
      environmental factors interacting with genetic polymorphisms. Some patients remain refractory
      to the best available therapies. In patients with intestinal inflammation related to other
      genetic disorders, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has led to disappearance of
      inflammation, for example, in patients with IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy,
      enteropathy, X-linked) and with a mutation in the Interleukin-10 receptor, characterized by a
      severe, early onset, fistulating colitis for which transplantation is the only therapy that
      offers benefit. Eleven patients with typical CD who achieved allogeneic donor chimerism after
      transplant had resolution of signs and symptoms of CD that was sustained for up to 15 years.
      These case series suggest that allogeneic transplantation has substantial potential to cure
      CD.

      HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS:

      The hypothesis is: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can achieve sustained
      remissions in patients with refractory CD, and can be done safely. The specific aims are: 1)
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic HCT as treatment for refractory CD. 2) To
      evaluate treatment effect on CD activity/severity using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      (CDAI) and the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). 3) To evaluate safety by scoring
      regimen-related toxicities, time to engraftment, infectious complications, acute and chronic
      Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and treatment-related mortality. 4) To evaluate the effect
      on quality of life.

      METHODS:

      This study is a prospective single-arm Phase II clinical trial that will enroll 12 patients.

      PATIENT SELECTION: Patients will have documented CD (see eligibility criteria below); signs
      and symptoms that have failed to respond satisfactorily to medical and surgical therapies;
      active intestinal inflammation by endoscopy and histology, and CDAI &gt;= 250 or need for total
      parenteral nutrition or recurrent inflammation after resection. Donors will be a Human
      Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or unrelated donor.

      ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE: Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning
      regimen of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and low-dose Total Body Irradiation (TBI), a regimen
      that has been used successfully in patients receiving haploidentical allografts. Marrow will
      be used as the graft source to reduce the risk of GVHD. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of
      post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide followed by the combination of tacrolimus and
      enteric coated mycophenolic acid. Supportive care includes the use of N-acetyl cysteine
      infusions to reduce the risk of sinusoidal liver injury from cyclophosphamide; prophylaxis
      with ursodiol to prevent cholestatic liver disease; and antimicrobial drugs as prophylaxis
      and preemptive treatment for infections by bacteria, fungi, herpes viruses, and Pneumocystis
      jiroveci. Tissue and blood samples will be archived for future studies and evaluation of
      immune reconstitution at predefined intervals.

      EFFICACY AND SAFETY ENDPOINTS: Safety and efficacy will be based on clinical assessments,
      laboratory testing, and gastrointestinal endoscopy and histology at baseline, at day 100
      post-transplant, and yearly for 5 years. The primary endpoint is event-free survival at 1
      year, defined as alive and free of active CD by endoscopy and biopsy. Transplant-related
      mortality is death occurring at any time after start of allogeneic HCT. Disease activity will
      be evaluated using CDAI. Quality of Life will be measured using the Short Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Questionnaire.

      RISKS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS: The major risks include regimen-related toxicity, infections,
      graft rejection, and GVHD. Autologous stem cells will be reserved in case of graft rejection.
      Recent advances in transplant technique have substantially reduced the mortality risk.
      Balancing these risks is the potential for allogeneic transplant to effect sustained
      remissions and cures of CD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HCT as treatment for
      refractory CD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate treatment effect on CD activity and severity.

      II. To evaluate safety of allogeneic HCT as determined by regimen-related toxicities,
      infectious complications, acute and chronic GVHD, treatment-related mortality, overall total
      mortality, and time to engraftment.

      III. To evaluate the effect of allogeneic HCT on quality of life (QOL) in patients with
      severe refractory CD.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING THERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30-60
      minutes on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients
      undergo 200 cGy of TBI on day -1.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic BMT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on
      days 3-4, tacrolimus IV daily or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 5-180 with taper to
      day 365, and mycophenolate acid enteric coated or mycophenolate mofetil PO three times daily
      (TID) on days 0-35.

      After completion of conditioning therapy and infusion of donor bone marrow cells, patients
      are followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, and then yearly thereafter for up to 60
      months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of CD established by referring physician(s) and confirmed by our review of
             the clinical presentation, clinical course, endoscopic and imaging findings, and
             histology of mucosal tissue specimens

          -  An adverse prognosis, documented by persistent signs and symptoms of CD that have
             failed to respond satisfactorily to medical and surgical therapies in the past,
             including but not limited to systemic immune suppressive drugs and biopharmaceuticals;
             to be considered as refractory to medical and surgical therapy, there must be
             clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evidence of active inflammatory Crohn's Disease
             that has either persisted or recurred despite exhaustive treatment with available
             pharmaceutical and surgical therapies; exhaustive treatment is defined as prior
             exposure to the following, without durable improvement:

               -  Systemic glucocorticoids at or above a prednisone equivalent of 40 mg/day for at
                  least 2 weeks, or until drug toxicity or intolerance develops

               -  Methotrexate (25 mg per week for at least 3 months, or until drug toxicity or
                  intolerance develops) and/or a thiopurine antimetabolite (either 2.5 mg/kg
                  azathioprine or 1.5 mg/kg 6-mercaptopurine in patients homozygous wild-type for
                  the thiopurine-S-methyltransferase [TPMT] gene, or either 1.5 mg/kg azathioprine
                  or 1 mg/kg 6-mercaptopurine in patients heterozygous for TPMT, or doses of these
                  drugs capable of producing a 6-thioguanine nucleotide level of 230-400 without
                  producing a 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotide level above 5700 for at least 3
                  months, or until drug allergy, intolerance or toxicity develops); if a patient is
                  homozygous mutant for the TPMT gene, thiopurines would be contraindicated and
                  their use would not be a requirement for enrollment in this protocol

               -  Use of at least two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies, that is,
                  infliximab (at least 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for at least 3 months, or until drug
                  allergy, toxicity or intolerance or anti-infliximab antibodies develop) and/or
                  adalimumab (at least 40 mg subcutaneously [SQ] every 2 weeks for at least 3
                  months, or until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance develops) and/or
                  certolizumab pegol (at least 400 mg SQ every 4 weeks for at least 3 months, or
                  until drug allergy, toxicity or intolerance develops)

               -  Due to the serious risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and
                  the reluctance of some patients to agree to therapy that carries such risk, prior
                  exposure to natalizumab is not required to meet the definition of exhaustive
                  pharmaceutical treatment; neither will use of natalizumab among patients who are
                  John Cunningham (JC) virus antibody seronegative be an exclusionary criterion

               -  Exhaustive surgical treatment will be defined as indicated operations for
                  complications of Crohn's Disease up to the point where the risks of surgery (for
                  example, mortality or post-operative morbidity such as short bowel syndrome or
                  extensive adhesions with high risk for inadvertent enterotomy) are deemed by
                  patients and their physicians to be unacceptably high; indicated operations for
                  complications of Crohn's Disease include, but are not limited to, surgical
                  resection of involved intestine, stricturoplasty, drainage, curettage, or
                  adhesiolysis of tissues affected by Crohn's disease

               -  Exposure of patients to investigational drug therapies for Crohn's Disease, that
                  is, to drugs that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this
                  indication, will not be a criterion for either inclusion or exclusion

          -  Endoscopic and histologic evidence of active intestinal inflammation consistent with
             CD; in the event that the involved mucosa cannot be readily reached by endoscopic
             biopsy, an imaging test that shows typical changes of CD in the intestinal tract will
             suffice as evidence of active intestinal inflammation; the presence of intestinal
             stomas does not exclude the patient from study

          -  Severe CD as defined by one of the following:

               -  CDAI &gt;= 250

               -  Need for total parenteral nutrition to maintain weight

               -  Recurrent intestinal inflammation caused by CD following surgical resection

          -  Identification of a HLA-matched hematopoietic cell donor without a history of a
             disorder that can be transmitted by hematopoietic cells, including but not limited to
             inflammatory bowel disease, and without nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
             containing 2 (NOD2) mutations in the case of a HLA matched sibling

          -  DONORS will be a HLA-identical sibling or HLA-matched unrelated donor; unrelated
             donors are required to be matched by high resolution allele level typing for HLA-A, B,
             C and DRB1 and intermediate resolution Sequence Specific Oligonucleotide Probes
             (SSOP), identifying alleles in groups of related families historically defined as
             antigens for DQB1; an unrelated donor is considered matched if patient and donor share
             HLA-A, B, C alleles with identical sequences at exons 2 and 3, DRB1 alleles with
             identical sequences at exon 2, and DQB1 results that include the same allele groups

          -  DONORS will have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document for bone marrow harvest.

        Exclusion Criteria:
