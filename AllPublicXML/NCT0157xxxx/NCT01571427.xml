  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Past epidemiological studies have demonstrated that larger social networks, or more frequent
      social interactions, could have potential protective effects on the incidence of Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). However, in those studies, indicators of social interactions were often broad,
      and included distinct elements that affected cognition and overall health. This project will
      examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation has positive effects on
      domain-specific cognitive functions among the elderly. Face-to-face communication will be
      conducted through the use of personal computers, webcams, and user-friendly simple
      interactive Internet programs to allow participants to have social engagement while staying
      at their home and also for the cost effective execution of the study.

      Participants are randomized into the control group (weekly 10 minutes phone check-in only) or
      experimental group (30 minutes daily video chat with standardized/trained conversational
      staff). User-friendly equipment and internet are provided.

    <measure>Changes in the Stroop Color and Word Test (Stroop Test C) Scores (Post-study Test Scores - Baseline Test Scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (primary endpoint) from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the Stroop test, subjects are required to read three different pages of stimuli in a designated time as quickly as possible. First, the individual is asked to name a series of colored squares (Color Naming task, Stroop Test A). Second, the individual is asked to read color words (Word Reading task, Stroop Test B). The final task is the Color-Word Naming task (Stroop Test C) on which the individual is shown the names of colors printed in conflicting ink colors (e.g., the word &quot;red&quot; in blue ink) and is asked to name the color of the ink rather than the word. Each test (A, B, C) is administered for 45 seconds. The number of words correctly named for the Stroop Test C was used here. The maximum score of this test is 100 (range: 0 - 100). The higher score indicates better functions. The changes (post-study - baseline test scores) among the experimental group are compared with those among the control group. The higher change scores mean improved function.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Cogstate Computerized Test: Detection Test (Post-study Test Score - Baseline Test Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (primary endpoint) from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In detection test, the on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Has the card turned over?&quot;. A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as the card flips over the participant must press &quot;Yes&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible.Speed of performance (mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses) is used here. Pre-post trial changes in test results among the experimental group were compared with pre-post changes among the control group using linear regression models. (no drop out reported and therefore no need to use mixed effects models or MMRM). Larger changes mean subjects got slower in reaction at the post-trial assessment. Negative changes indicates subjects got faster in reaction at the post-trial assessment.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Cogstate One Back Accuracy (Post-study Test Score - Baseline Test Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (primary endpoint) from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, the on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Is the previous card the same?&quot;. A playing card is presented face up in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If the card is the same the participant should press &quot;Yes&quot;, and if it is not the same the participant should press &quot;No&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible. Accuracy of performance (arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses) is reported here. Pre-post trial changes in test results among the experimental group will be compared with pre-post changes among the control group using linear regression models. (no drop out reported and therefore no need to use mixed effects models or MMRM). Larger changes mean the score improved at the post trial assessment.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Cogstate Two Back Accuracy (Post-study Test Score - Baseline Test Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (primary endpoint) from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, the on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Is the card the same as that shown two cards ago?&quot;. A playing card is presented face up in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the card shown two cards previously. If the card is the same the participant should press &quot;Yes&quot;, and if it is not the same the participant should press &quot;No&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible. Accuracy of performance (arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses) is reported here. Pre-post trial changes in test results among the experimental group will be compared with pre-post changes among the control group using linear regression models.

    <measure>Changes in CAMCI Total Score (Post-study Test Score - Baseline Test Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (primary endpoint) from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Assessment (CAMCI) is a battery of computerized tasks to assess cognitive performance, developed by the Psychology Software Tools. The software provides standardized score (z-score) based on subject's age, sex and education.* The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Higher Z-score means better cognitive function. A positive change in Z-scores here indicates a favorable outcome. Total score (global cognitive function measure) is used here. Pre-post trial changes in test results among the experimental group are compared with pre-post changes among the control group using linear regression models. (no drop out reported and therefore no need to use mixed effects models or MMRM)

        <title>Changes in Verbal Fluency Letter Test Scores (Post-study Test Score - Baseline Test Score)</title>
        <description>Verbal fluency letter test is a neuropsychological test. In the test, participants have to produce as many words as possible which start with a letter F, A and S (3 separate test for each letter) within 60 seconds. Each test score ranges from 0 to 40. Total of 3 tests scores (F, A and S) ranges from 0 to 120. Changes in test results among the experimental group are compared with changes among the control group using linear regression models. (no drop out reported and therefore no need to use mixed effects models or MMRM) Higher values mean decline is less or test scores improved at post-study assessment.</description>

        <title>Changes in the Stroop Color and Word Test (Stroop Test C) Scores (Post-study Test Scores - Baseline Test Scores)</title>
        <description>In the Stroop test, subjects are required to read three different pages of stimuli in a designated time as quickly as possible. First, the individual is asked to name a series of colored squares (Color Naming task, Stroop Test A). Second, the individual is asked to read color words (Word Reading task, Stroop Test B). The final task is the Color-Word Naming task (Stroop Test C) on which the individual is shown the names of colors printed in conflicting ink colors (e.g., the word &quot;red&quot; in blue ink) and is asked to name the color of the ink rather than the word. Each test (A, B, C) is administered for 45 seconds. The number of words correctly named for the Stroop Test C was used here. The maximum score of this test is 100 (range: 0 - 100). The higher score indicates better functions. The changes (post-study - baseline test scores) among the experimental group are compared with those among the control group. The higher change scores mean improved function.</description>

(no drop out reported and therefore no need to use mixed effects models or MMRM). Larger changes mean the score improved at the post trial assessment.</description>

        <description>In this test, the on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Is the card the same as that shown two cards ago?&quot;. A playing card is presented face up in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the card shown two cards previously. If the card is the same the participant should press &quot;Yes&quot;, and if it is not the same the participant should press &quot;No&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible. Accuracy of performance (arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses) is reported here.

        <description>Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Assessment (CAMCI) is a battery of computerized tasks to assess cognitive performance, developed by the Psychology Software Tools. The software provides standardized score (z-score) based on subject's age, sex and education.* The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Higher Z-score means better cognitive function. A positive change in Z-scores here indicates a favorable outcome. Total score (global cognitive function measure) is used here. Pre-post trial changes in test results among the experimental group are compared with pre-post changes among the control group using linear regression models. (no drop out reported and therefore no need to use mixed effects models or MMRM)
