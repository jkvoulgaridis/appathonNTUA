    <measure>(Behavior) Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R; Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 180 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R; short form) was used to assess effortful control (12 items) and activity level (3 items). The IBQ-R measures early temperament-based inhibitory control,a key component of executive function as children mature. Scores range from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater frequency of behaviors. IBQ-R scores were measured at baseline and then again at study completion (180 days post randomization). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the IBQ-R value at 180 days minus the IBQ-R value at baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>(Development) Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition(Bayley-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 180 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition, (Bayley-III) is an instrument designed to measure the developmental functioning of infants and toddlers between the ages of 1 month and 42 months (age adjustments for prematurity are accommodated with the tool). It provides age specific composite scores for cognitive (91 items,score min 55 max 145), language (98 items, score min 47 max 153), and motor (138 items, score min 46 max 154) skills. For all scales, higher scores are better and lower scores indicate possible delay/deficit. Bayley-III scores were measured at baseline and then again at study completion (180 days post randomization). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the Bayley-III value at 180 days minus the Bayley-III value at baseline). Secondary Outcome for 1st stage of project funded by Allen Foundation, Inc; Primary Outcome for 2nd stage of project funded by March of Dimes and Health Resources and Services Administration</description>

    <measure>Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 180 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The following sleep characteristics were captured based on caregiver-report: nocturnal sleep duration (hours), daytime sleep duration (hours), total sleep duration within a 24-hour period (hours). Larger values represent more time spent in each type of sleep. BISQ scores were measured at baseline and then again at study completion (180 days post randomization). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the BISQ value at 180 days minus the BISQ value at baseline).</description>

    <measure>Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 180 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in body composition from baseline to 6 months post-randomization (weight, recumbent length, head circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA)</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>BITSEA measures socioemotional development in toddlerhood. Scores were summed to provide competence (range: 0-22) and problem (range: 0-62) scores, respectively. The problem scale is further divided into subscales: externalizing (6 items; range: 0-12), internalizing (8 items; range: 0-16), and dysregulation (8 items; range: 0-16). Additionally, 14 items comprise a red flag scale (range: 0-28). Eight items from the competence and nine items from the problem subscales are indicative of behaviors often seen in children with ASD. Each of the 17 ASD items was dichotomized to illustrate the presence (1) (i.e., competence items absent, problem items present) or absence (0) (i.e., competence items present, problem items absent) of each ASD behavior. Items were then summed to derive an ASD score (range: 0-17). Higher competence scores represent better functioning, whereas higher problem (including the problem subscales), red flag, and ASD scores were indicative of poorer functioning.</description>

    <measure>Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test - II, Stage 2 (PDDST-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The PDDST-II is a clinically derived, caregiver-completed screener to assist in differentiating an ASD diagnosis from other disorders in children with developmental concerns, including those born preterm. The PDDST-II comprised 14 yes/no items that indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of developmental concerns. Items were summed (possible range: 0-14) and higher scores represented greater developmental concern, with a cut-score &gt;5 signifying concern for ASD.</description>

    <measure>Other Long-term Outcomes: Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Long-term effect (6 months +) after intervention completion</time_frame>
    <description>Long-term (26-32 months of age) outcomes. This will be evaluated using scores on the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ).The following sleep characteristics were captured based on caregiver-report: nocturnal sleep duration (hours), daytime sleep duration (hours), total sleep duration within a 24-hour period (hours). Larger values represent more time spent in each type of sleep. BISQ scores were measured at baseline and then again at post-intervention follow-up (approximately 8 months after the trial ended). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the BISQ value at post-intervention follow-up minus the BISQ value at baseline).</description>

        <description>Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R; short form) was used to assess effortful control (12 items) and activity level (3 items). The IBQ-R measures early temperament-based inhibitory control,a key component of executive function as children mature. Scores range from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater frequency of behaviors. IBQ-R scores were measured at baseline and then again at study completion (180 days post randomization). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the IBQ-R value at 180 days minus the IBQ-R value at baseline).</description>

        <title>(Development) Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition(Bayley-III)</title>
        <description>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition, (Bayley-III) is an instrument designed to measure the developmental functioning of infants and toddlers between the ages of 1 month and 42 months (age adjustments for prematurity are accommodated with the tool). It provides age specific composite scores for cognitive (91 items,score min 55 max 145), language (98 items, score min 47 max 153), and motor (138 items, score min 46 max 154) skills. For all scales, higher scores are better and lower scores indicate possible delay/deficit. Bayley-III scores were measured at baseline and then again at study completion (180 days post randomization). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the Bayley-III value at 180 days minus the Bayley-III value at baseline). Secondary Outcome for 1st stage of project funded by Allen Foundation, Inc; Primary Outcome for 2nd stage of project funded by March of Dimes and Health Resources and Services Administration</description>

        <title>Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA)</title>
        <description>BITSEA measures socioemotional development in toddlerhood. Scores were summed to provide competence (range: 0-22) and problem (range: 0-62) scores, respectively. The problem scale is further divided into subscales: externalizing (6 items; range: 0-12), internalizing (8 items; range: 0-16), and dysregulation (8 items; range: 0-16). Additionally, 14 items comprise a red flag scale (range: 0-28). Eight items from the competence and nine items from the problem subscales are indicative of behaviors often seen in children with ASD. Each of the 17 ASD items was dichotomized to illustrate the presence (1) (i.e., competence items absent, problem items present) or absence (0) (i.e., competence items present, problem items absent) of each ASD behavior. Items were then summed to derive an ASD score (range: 0-17). Higher competence scores represent better functioning, whereas higher problem (including the problem subscales), red flag, and ASD scores were indicative of poorer functioning.</description>

        <title>Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test - II, Stage 2 (PDDST-II)</title>
        <description>The PDDST-II is a clinically derived, caregiver-completed screener to assist in differentiating an ASD diagnosis from other disorders in children with developmental concerns, including those born preterm. The PDDST-II comprised 14 yes/no items that indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of developmental concerns. Items were summed (possible range: 0-14) and higher scores represented greater developmental concern, with a cut-score &gt;5 signifying concern for ASD.</description>

        <title>Other Long-term Outcomes: Sleep</title>
        <description>Long-term (26-32 months of age) outcomes. This will be evaluated using scores on the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ).The following sleep characteristics were captured based on caregiver-report: nocturnal sleep duration (hours), daytime sleep duration (hours), total sleep duration within a 24-hour period (hours). Larger values represent more time spent in each type of sleep. BISQ scores were measured at baseline and then again at post-intervention follow-up (approximately 8 months after the trial ended). The scores were calculated as a change between two time points (the BISQ value at post-intervention follow-up minus the BISQ value at baseline).</description>
