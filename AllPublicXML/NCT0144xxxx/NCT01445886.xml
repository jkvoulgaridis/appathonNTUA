  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of indigo naturalis oil
      extract and calcipotriol solution in the treatment of psoriatic nails, to show that indigo
      naturalis oil extract may be a good choice for treating nail psoriasis, and potentially an
      effective alternative for those who do not respond well to traditional therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in treating nail psoriasis is
      rarely reported. Recently, the investigators developed a new product, indigo naturalis oil
      extract, which worked well in nail disease. In our randomized, observer-blind,
      vehicle-controlled trial showed that indigo naturalis oil extract is effective and safe in
      treating nail psoriasis. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of indigo
      naturalis oil extract with calcipotriol solution in patients with nail psoriasis using
      controlled, bilateral comparison

      The investigators will enroll 33 patients with nail psoriasis from the ambulatory department
      of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Indigo naturalis oil extract will be consistently applied on
      either the left or right affected nail folds, while calcipotriol will be applied on the
      opposite side, both twice daily for 24 weeks, allowing intra-patient comparison. The nails
      will be assessed by two dermatologists before treatment and at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Single-handed Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (shNAPSI) at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The nails will be assessed by two dermatologists at baseline and after treatment 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 weeks using single-handed Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (shNAPSI) score. shNAPSI evaluation: Each nail is given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) , the total of which is the score for that nail (0-8); the range of shNAPSI of one hand is between 0 and 40, with higher score indicating more severe symptoms. Nail bed psoriasis: presence of any of the nail bed features (onycholysis, hemorrhages, hyperkeratosis, &quot;oil drop&quot; (salmon patch dyschroma): 0 for none, 1 for 1 quadrant only, 2 for 2 quadrants, 3 for 3 quadrants, and 4 for 4 quadrants. Nail matrix psoriasis: presence of any of the nail matrix features (pitting, leukonychia red spots in the lunula, crumbling): 0 for none, 1 if present in 1 quadrant of the nail, 2 if present in 2 quadrants of the nail, 3 if present in 3 quadrants of the nail, and 4 if present in 4 quadrants of the nail.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Target NAPSI for the Single Most Severely Affected Nail</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The target nail will be assessed by two dermatologists before treatment and at week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 using modified target NAPSI score (mtNAPSI, 0-96).
mtNAPSI evaluation: a target nail is divided into 4 quadrants and for each quadrant the nail parameters (oil drop, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, hemorrhages, pitting, leukonychia, red spots on the lunula, and crumbling) are assessed separately: 0 = no sign, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe; the range of mtNAPSI is between 0 and 96, with higher score indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Physician's and Subject's Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician's and Subject's Global Assessment (PGA and SGA) will be assessed by two dermatologists and participant himself/herself respectively after treatment 24 weeks.
A 6-point scale was used for both SGA and PGA: 0 = worse, 1 = 0-24% clearing with little or no change, 2 = 25-49% clearing with slight improvement, 3 = 50-74% clearing with moderate improvement, 4 = 75-99% clearing with striking improvement, 5 = cleared. A score between 3 and 5 was considered to be a positive response and a score between 0 and 2 a poor response.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Target NAPSI for the Single Most Severely Affected Nail</title>
        <description>The target nail will be assessed by two dermatologists before treatment and at week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 using modified target NAPSI score (mtNAPSI, 0-96).
mtNAPSI evaluation: a target nail is divided into 4 quadrants and for each quadrant the nail parameters (oil drop, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis, hemorrhages, pitting, leukonychia, red spots on the lunula, and crumbling) are assessed separately: 0 = no sign, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe; the range of mtNAPSI is between 0 and 96, with higher score indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Physician's and Subject's Global Assessment (PGA and SGA) will be assessed by two dermatologists and participant himself/herself respectively after treatment 24 weeks.
A 6-point scale was used for both SGA and PGA: 0 = worse, 1 = 0-24% clearing with little or no change, 2 = 25-49% clearing with slight improvement, 3 = 50-74% clearing with moderate improvement, 4 = 75-99% clearing with striking improvement, 5 = cleared. A score between 3 and 5 was considered to be a positive response and a score between 0 and 2 a poor response.</description>
