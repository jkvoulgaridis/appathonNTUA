      The purpose of this study is a comparison of pain management in opioid-tolerant spine surgery
      patients using a perioperative dosing goal of 150% of patient's baseline oral morphine
      equivalent (OME), as compared to standard perioperative dosing, which does not currently
      account for patients' baseline opiate use.

    <textblock>
      Spine surgery patients experience high levels of pain and report poor pain management in
      patient satisfaction surveys. Data examined from Allina HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment
      of Healthcare Providers and Systems) pain management questions indicate that spine surgery
      patients report poor pain management. In July, August, and September 2010 patients on the
      Abbott Northwestern (ANW) spine surgery unit reported 62% on the composite pain score
      compared to 69% to 71% for ANW overall. During these same three months, the proportion of
      patients on this unit reporting their pain was always well controlled ranged from 49% to 57%
      compared to 59% to 64% for the hospital overall. Since ANW serves a high number of spine
      surgery patients, this poor pain management reporting is a concern for patient care and
      possibly for future Medicare/Medicaid funding formulas.

      Opioid-tolerant patients pose a particular challenge to pain management. The intervention to
      be tested specifically targets patients who are determined to be opioid-tolerant patients.
      Opioid-tolerant patients are generally patients who have severe chronic pain, and, thus, are
      taking pain medication regularly. Tolerance occurs when chronic exposure to a drug diminishes
      its analgesic effect or creates the need for a higher dose to maintain this effect. Given the
      severe chronic pain conditions of many patients who are presenting for spine surgery, there
      is a high level of opioid tolerance among these patients.

      While there is no agreed upon definition in the literature about a fixed opioid amount that
      constitutes &quot;opioid tolerance,&quot; Abbott Northwestern Hospital has a working definition of
      opioid tolerant patients as those who are receiving ≥ 20 mg of oxycodone (or equivalent)/day
      for &gt; 7 days. This definition is slightly more aggressive than the Institute of Safe
      Medication Practices definition which set the standard at &quot;at least 30 mg oxycodone/day for
      greater than a week.&quot;

      While higher postoperative pain status has been documented in opioid-tolerant patients, very
      little has been done to examine customizing perioperative opioid dosing to improve pain
      management in this population. The proposed intervention is designed specifically to test if
      post-operative pain management can be improved in opioid-tolerant patients using
      perioperative goal-directed parenteral opioid dosing based on 150% of the patient's baseline
      oral morphine equivalent (OME). It is important to note this method of perioperative
      goal-directed parenteral opioid dosing has been used at ANW on spine surgery patients, based
      on clinical decision of the anesthesiologist. However, this strategy has not been tested
      compared to standard care.

      For this study our research questions are:

        1. Does the intervention improve immediate (4 hours) post-operative pain over the
           comparison group?

        2. Does the intervention improve management during the 24 hours (or at discharge) after the
           recovery period over the comparison group?

        3. Is the clinical intervention associated with selected improved post-operative status
           measures compared to the control group?

        4. Is the clinical intervention associated with long-term differences in reported pain
           scores or medication levels as measured by a phone call at 4 weeks after surgery?

    <description>We will be assessing if the intervention improves immediate (4 hours) postoperative pain control as compared to the non-intervention group. Measures that will be used to assess immediate post-operative pain include: Verbal pain scores, opioid consumption, and vital signs. Verbal pain scores were reported using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale which ranges from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst). Higher numerical scores on the scale indicate more pain, thus a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>We will be assessing if the intervention improved postoperative pain management during the first 24 hours after the recovery period (first 4 hours postoperatively) as compared to the non-intervention group. Measures that will be used to assess success: Verbal pain scores, opioid consumption (doses and frequency), and vital signs. Verbal pain scores were reported using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale which ranges from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst). Higher numerical scores on the scale indicate more pain, thus a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>We will be assessing if the intervention improves immediate (4 hours) postoperative pain control as compared to the non-intervention group. Measures that will be used to assess immediate post-operative pain include: Verbal pain scores, opioid consumption, and vital signs. Verbal pain scores were reported using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale which ranges from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst). Higher numerical scores on the scale indicate more pain, thus a worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Immediate Postoperative Pain Control</title>
          <description>We will be assessing if the intervention improves immediate (4 hours) postoperative pain control as compared to the non-intervention group. Measures that will be used to assess immediate post-operative pain include: Verbal pain scores, opioid consumption, and vital signs. Verbal pain scores were reported using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale which ranges from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst). Higher numerical scores on the scale indicate more pain, thus a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Pain Management Improvement at 24 Hours After the Recovery Period</title>
        <description>We will be assessing if the intervention improved postoperative pain management during the first 24 hours after the recovery period (first 4 hours postoperatively) as compared to the non-intervention group. Measures that will be used to assess success: Verbal pain scores, opioid consumption (doses and frequency), and vital signs. Verbal pain scores were reported using the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale which ranges from 0 (no hurt) to 10 (hurts worst). Higher numerical scores on the scale indicate more pain, thus a worse outcome.</description>
