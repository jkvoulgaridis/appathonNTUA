  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major purpose of this research study is to better understand how therapy works on
      different patients. This study is being offered to patients with a diagnosis of advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer who have failed anthracycline based therapy.

      The investigators want to see the response of breast cancer cell when treated with
      Chloroquine used in combination with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is an anti-cancer drug that
      is given through your vein. The chemotherapy used in this study is either Taxane (Paclitaxel)
      or Taxane-like drugs (Abraxane, Ixabepilone or Docetaxel).

      The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity of the combination of
      Chloroquine combined with a Taxane or Taxane-like chemo agents(Paclitaxel, Docetaxel,
      Abraxane, Ixabepilone).

      The laboratories have developed robust preclinical models utilizing both in vitro systems
      such as the mammosphere (MS) culture and in vivo systems such as human breast cancer
      xenografts allowing the investigators to identify agents which selectively target TICs, as
      single agents or in combination. These models are critical since tumor initiating cells
      (TICs) comprise only a small percentage of the tumor bulk, so that clinical tumor regression
      may not be observed with inhibitors that selectively target TIC self-renewal alone.
      Nonetheless, these agents in combination with conventional therapy may effectively kill both
      actively cycling or fully differentiated cells and the TIC subpopulation, leading to long
      term remission and eradication of cancer cells.
