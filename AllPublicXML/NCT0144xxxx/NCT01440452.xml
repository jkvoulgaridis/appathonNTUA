  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see how different amounts of Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) affect cycling on factors in blood and spinal cord in people with spinal cord
      inflammation.

      FES cycling is a method of applying low level electrical currents to the leg and buttock
      muscles to cause the weakened or paralyzed muscles to contract and produce a cycling motion
      of the legs. The FES cycling in this study will be done through a device called the RT300-SL
      Cycle Ergometer (RT300).

      Although this device has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by
      individuals with neurological disorders, we are trying to find out the best way to use it in
      order to obtain the greatest results.

This is a free service that texts your mobile phone daily asking you to rate your mood on a scale of 1 (low) through 10 (high). We will not monitor your entries during the study but only at the final visit when we will get a printout of the course of your mood during the study. After completion of the study we will assist you in removing us from your Mood24/7 account and we will no longer have access to your mood reports outside of the study period.</description>

            <description>For 3 weeks, you will need to come to the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury at Kennedy Krieger Institute (ICSCI) one (1) time per week during which you will perform FES cycling for 1 hour each.
FES Cycling: You will be seated in your own wheelchair in front of the cycle. We will place your legs onto the cycle and secure them with straps. Electrodes (pads that stick to the skin) will be placed on your skin on your legs and buttock. The pads will be connected to a stimulator box through a wire. We will then start the cycle motor and stimulate your leg and buttock muscles with electric current. This will cause your legs to cycle. You will do this for 1 hour.
Lumbar puncture: The study includes 2 lumbar punctures: one at the beginning of the study and one at the end. During a lumbar puncture a small needle will be inserted into the lower back and a small amount of spinal fluid will be drained (about 1 tablespoon).</description>

Electrodes (pads that stick to the skin) will be placed on your skin on your legs and buttock. The pads will be connected to a stimulator box through a wire. We will then start the cycle motor and stimulate your leg and buttock muscles with electric current. This will cause your legs to cycle. You will do this for 1 hour.
Lumbar puncture: The study includes 2 lumbar punctures: one at the beginning of the study and one at the end. During a lumbar puncture a small needle will be inserted into the lower back and a small amount of spinal fluid will be drained (about 1 tablespoon).</description>

Cycling without FES: You will be seated in your own wheelchair in front of the cycle. We will place your legs onto the cycle and secure them with straps. The cycle is configured to work without FES. We will then start the cycle motor. This will cause your legs to cycle. You will do this for 1 hour.

            <description>For 3 weeks, you will need to come to the ICSCI three (3) times per week during which you will perform FES cycling for 1 hour each.
FES Cycling: You will be seated in your own wheelchair in front of the cycle. We will place your legs onto the cycle and secure them with straps. Electrodes (pads that stick to the skin) will be placed on your skin on your legs and buttock. The pads will be connected to a stimulator box through a wire. We will then start the cycle motor and stimulate your leg and buttock muscles with electric current. This will cause your legs to cycle. You will do this for 1 hour.
Lumbar puncture: The study includes 2 lumbar punctures: one at the beginning of the study and one at the end. During a lumbar puncture a small needle will be inserted into the lower back and a small amount of spinal fluid will be drained (about 1 tablespoon).</description>

            <description>For 3 weeks, you will need to come to the ICSCI three (3) times per week during which you will perform cycling without FES for 1 hour each.
Cycling without FES: You will be seated in your own wheelchair in front of the cycle. We will place your legs onto the cycle and secure them with straps. The cycle is configured to work without FES. We will then start the cycle motor. This will cause your legs to cycle. You will do this for 1 hour.
