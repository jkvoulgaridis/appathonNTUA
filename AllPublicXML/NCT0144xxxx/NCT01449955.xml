  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to determine if pairing reactivation of a traumatic
      memory with a single administration of Rapamycin (e.g., Sirolimus) in men with combat-related
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder leads to a reduction of the emotional strength of that
      particular traumatic memory.

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

        1. Traumatic memory reactivation paired with a single dose of Rapamycin will decrease
           objective measures of stress and self-report of stress during replay of the traumatic
           memory, relative to, subjects receiving placebo.

        2. Pairing administration of Rapamycin with traumatic memory reactivation will decrease
           symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder one month and three months later, relative to
           patients receiving placebo.

      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive memories in the form of
      unwanted images, nightmares, and flashbacks as the result of being exposed to a traumatic
      event . Current research efforts have begun to explore the underlying neurochemical changes
      associated with PTSD. Recently, these efforts have focused on the prevention of PTSD in
      persons exposed to trauma. For example, preliminary evidence suggests that interference with
      consolidation of trauma-related memories using the beta-antagonist, propranolol, may prevent
      PTSD in humans with recent traumas. However, given that as much as 90% of the US population
      is exposed to at least one traumatic event during their lifetimes, the utility of this
      treatment is limited by the logistical problems of treating everyone at risk. To date, there
      have been very few systematic studies on humans that focus on changing the underlying
      traumatic memory once PTSD has been established.

      The trauma experience is initially stored in short-term memory, then consolidated into
      long-term memory. However, the long-term stability conferred by the consolidation process
      undergoes a period of labiality as follows. Each time a consolidated memory is activated, the
      memory trace becomes newly labile and must be consolidated again to remain in long-term
      memory5. This process is called reconsolidation. Reconsolidation therefore offers a biologic
      window during which long-term memories can be disrupted. Preclinical studies have begun to
      unravel the biological changes that underlie these processes. Both pharmacological agents,
      including glucocorticoids, and protein synthesis inhibitors can interfere with memory
      consolidation and reconsolidation. In preclinical studies, the global protein synthesis
      inhibitor anisomycin can block reconsolidation, leading to a reduction in strength of
      traumatic memories. Unfortunately, the toxicity of anisomycin is prohibitive for therapeutic
      use. Thus, rather than using a global protein synthesis inhibitor, a more effective and
      selective means of reducing consolidation of an established traumatic memory is to target
      only a subset of protein translation important for synaptic plasticity. The protein kinase
      mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is just such a regulator of a subset of protein
      synthesis critical for synaptic plasticity.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician administered interview which assesses the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress disorder at baseline, and then again 1 month posttreatment. The CAPS is a 25 item semi-structured interview that assesses the 17 DSM-IV PTSD criteria as well as social and occupational impairment. For each item the participant can respond with a rating of 0-8 (with 0 indicating no symptom severity and frequency and 8 indicating extreme symptom severity and frequency). The range of total scores on a CAPS is from 0-136, with a greater score indicating greater PTSD symptom severity. The total score is computed by summing the aforementioned 17 items. Additionally, the CAPS assesses for a positive PTSD diagnosis by assessing for the three DSM-IV criteria of B, C, and D. In order to meet a positive screen for each criteria, a person must screen positive for symptoms by reporting a score of 3 or more on the specific symptom criterion.</description>

    <description>Sirolimus is an FDA approved immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation, and is especially useful in kidney transplants. It is non-toxic to kidneys, unlike other immunosuppressants. In this study, the medication will be administered once to see if it interferes with emotional memory reconsolidation. This is based on the fact that it inhibits the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) through directly binding the mTOR Complex1 (mTORC1). mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis and transcription.
a single dosage of 15mg will be administered during this study.</description>

        <title>Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS)</title>
        <description>Clinician administered interview which assesses the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress disorder at baseline, and then again 1 month posttreatment. The CAPS is a 25 item semi-structured interview that assesses the 17 DSM-IV PTSD criteria as well as social and occupational impairment. For each item the participant can respond with a rating of 0-8 (with 0 indicating no symptom severity and frequency and 8 indicating extreme symptom severity and frequency). The range of total scores on a CAPS is from 0-136, with a greater score indicating greater PTSD symptom severity. The total score is computed by summing the aforementioned 17 items. Additionally, the CAPS assesses for a positive PTSD diagnosis by assessing for the three DSM-IV criteria of B, C, and D. In order to meet a positive screen for each criteria, a person must screen positive for symptoms by reporting a score of 3 or more on the specific symptom criterion.</description>

        <description>The QIDS is a 16-item self-report measure that assesses how much a participant endorses each of the DSM-IV-TR symptoms of depression, with each item scored from 0 (no endorsement of symptom) to 3 (endorsement of severe symptomatology). Scores on the QIDS range from 0-27, with higher scores indicating higher depressive symptom severity.</description>
