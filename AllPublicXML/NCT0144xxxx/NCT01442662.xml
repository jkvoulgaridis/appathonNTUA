  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to study the activity of pazopanib in second line after
      anthracyclines in extra uterus and uterine LMS in association with gemcitabine.

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the PFS using combination of gemcitabine and pazopanib in patients with
      metastasis or relapse leiomyosarcoma (uterine or soft tissue)who have already received s
      first line anthracycline based therapy.

      Secondary objectives:

      To determine the disease control rate To determine the response rate To determine toxicities
      associated with combined gemcitabine and pazopanib To determine correlation between metabolic
      response and PFS

      Design:

      All eligible patients entering the study will receive daily oral pazopanib at 800mg, supplied
      as 200 mg aqueous film-coated tablets and 2 intravenous gemcitabine every three weeks (8
      cycles max).

      The treatment will continue until the development of unacceptable toxicity or evidence of
      disease progression or until patient's / investigator's decision of withdrawal.
