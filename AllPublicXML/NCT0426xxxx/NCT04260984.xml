  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      De Quervain's disease is a common clinical disorder, characterized by pain at radial side of
      the wrist. It often interferes wrist and thumb movement, and may affect activity of daily
      life. It is caused by overuse and impaired gliding of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and
      extensor policis brevis (EPB) tendons at the styloid process of the radius. It is associated
      with postpartum baby care, or jobs or hobbies that involve repetitive hand and wrist motions.
      The most effective treatment is corticosteroid injection into the tendon sheath of the
      conjoined tendons of APL and EPB. Over the past few years because of advancement of
      sonography in the musculoskeletal system, ultrasound (US)-guided intra-sheath injection has
      become popular, and it has been proved to improve the accuracy of placement of needle tip in
      the tendon sheath, however, studies comparing the effect and side effects of US-guided
      corticosteroid injection with palpation-guided injection for de Quervain's disease have never
      been reported before. The purposes of this study are to compare the effectiveness and side
      effects of US-guided and palpation-guided corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's
      disease.

      The investigators plan to recruit 70 patients with de Quervain's disease, half of them will
      be randomly assigned into US-guided injection group, and the other half into the
      palpation-guided injection group. Each subject will receive one shot of injection and each
      subject will expect to fill in the evaluation form at baseline, and at 1 week, 3 months, and
      6 months after the injection. Statistics will be performed after completing the patients'
      treatment and evaluations.

    <description>QuickDASH is a self-report questionnaire comprising 11 items that focuses on symptoms and the ability to perform certain upper extremity activities on a five-point Likert-type scale. The scores range from 0 (the best) to 100 (the worst). The reliability of QuickDASH was 0.93, and the validity based on response of full-length DASH was 0.96.18</description>

    <measure>VAS pain</measure>
    <time_frame>beginning of the treatment and at 1 week ,3 months and 6 months after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient or the assessor recorded the level of perceived pain by making a vertical mark between the 2 ends of a 10-cm horizontal line. The 0-cm point would represent no pain, while the 10-cm end represents the most extreme pain imaginable. The distance from 0cm to the mark was measured. The reliability of VAS for pain is .94.19</description>

For palpation-guided injection, a 2.5cm 25-gauge needle will be inserted almost horizontally between APL and EPB tendons, just distal to the radial styloid, at the site of maximum tenderness. Then the mixture of triamcinolone and lidocaine will be pushed into the common tendon sheath.</description>

    <description>For US-guided injection, a 22 MHZ linear array probe (Esaote MyLab™ClassC, Italy) will be used for guidance of injection via a transverse scan, in-plane approach. After sterilization, the probe will be placed at the radial styloid with maximal swelling or tenderness. Then a 2.5 cm 25-gauge needle will be placed into the tendon sheath via transverse scan, in-the-plane approach, and the injectate will be pushed into the tendon sheath. Care will be taken avoiding injury of vessels and the superficial branch of radial nerve during the injection.</description>
