  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate behavioral interventions in conjunction with medical
      rehabilitation to promote functional health in patients recovering from orthopedic surgery.
      Half of the subjects in this study will be assigned to an intervention that meets with a
      study therapist to discuss implementing healthy habits. The other half of subjects will
      assigned to an intervention group that meets with a study therapists to discuss implementing
      healthy sleep habits. Both groups will undergo several physical and cognitive assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving healthy habits such as sleep, nutrition or physical activity is expected to enhance
      rehabilitation in knee or hip arthroplasty patients, by increasing their ability to attend
      and adhere to rehabilitation recommendations following surgery. Half of the subjects in this
      study will be assigned to an intervention that meets with a study therapist to discuss
      implementing healthy habits (physical activity, nutrition, pain-coping techniques, etc). The
      other half of subjects will assigned to an intervention group that meets with a study
      therapists to discuss implementing healthy sleep habits. Both groups will undergo several
      physical and cognitive assessments at baseline (prior to surgery), in-hospital,
      post-hospital, post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up visit.

    <description>ISI is a questionnaire that provides a clinically meaningful index of insomnia. It is a 7-item validated self-report scale that assesses subjective symptoms of insomnia. Items are scored on a 0-4 scale to yield a score of 0-28. Higher scores indicate greater insomnia severity. A cutoff score of ≥ 10 is optimal to detect clinical levels of insomnia.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients (ages 55+) planning on having a hip or knee arthroplasty.

          2. The ability to communicate during the screening process (e.g., no aphasia or other
             severe language impairment).

          3. Meet DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder assessed by Duke Structured Interview for
             Sleep Disorders.

          4. Score ≥10 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) or ≥5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
             Index (PSQI).

          5. Referral and attendance of medical rehabilitation post-discharge.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of recent severe mental health disorders (e.g., suicide attempt or
             psychiatric hospitalization in the past year).

          2. Presence of psychotic disorder, substance abuse or dependence, or bipolar disorder
             assessed by MINI International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (to increase
             generalizability other psychiatric comorbidities such as depression or anxiety will
             not be excluded).

          3. Untreated comorbid sleep disorders based on structured diagnostic interview including:
             narcolepsy, periodic leg movement disorder, and/or obstructive sleep apnea risk.

          4. Cognitive impairment defined as &lt;20 on the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) that could
             potentially limit comprehension of the intervention. Note, while an MMSE of &lt;24 is
             often used as a cutoff for cognitive impairment, we do not wish to exclude those with
             mild cognitive problems from this study as there is evidence that individuals with
             mild cognitive problems still benefit from insomnia treatments.

          5. Must live within 30 miles of recruiting site.
