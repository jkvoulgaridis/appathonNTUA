  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemostasis-related disorders are common in cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, it is
      not known whether the net effect of changes in hemostasis in the sense of predisposition to
      hemorrhagic or thrombotic state. It is suggested that increasing the concentration and
      activities of Von Willebrand factor (vWF) and decline ADAMTS-13 (A Disintegrin and
      Metalloproteinase with Trombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) may cause thrombophilic changes
      in cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in
      ADAMTS-13 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13) and von
      willebrand factor (vWF) levels and activities in patients with cirrhosis and portal
      hypertension.

      Patients of 3 months to 18 years of age, followed-up or newly diagnosed in pediatric
      gastroenterology unit, who had cirrhosis or non cirrhotic portal hypertension included to the
      study. Written informed consent obtained from the parents and/or patients. The subjects was
      grouped in three. The first group consisted of patients with cirrhosis (with or without
      portal hypertension). The second group consisted of patients with non-cirrhotic portal
      hypertension (developed due thrombosis of portal vein). The last group consisted of healthy
      volunteers.

      2 ml of EDTA blood was taken from the patients and healty volunters. Samples will be tested
      for vWF and ADAMTS-13 levels and activities at the end of the study.

      The clinical scoring methods, PELD, MELD and Child Pugh scores, treatments received by
      patients, data from endoscopic, radiological screening, and blood analysis of patients were
      recorded.
