  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding has been associated with decreased obesity. However, this relationship is not
      as clear in children who have been exposed to GDM and the mechanisms involved are little
      known. The overall objective of the project is to study the mechanisms of breastfeeding on
      the growth of children in women who have had a GDM. More specifically, the project want to
      compare the macronutrient and hormone composition of breast milk of women with and without
      GDM. Investigators also want to associate the levels of hormones related to satiety and
      energy metabolism (i.e. endocannabinoids, ghrelin, leptin) in the human milk of women with or
      without DG and the growth of the child. A total of 60 women (30 with GDM and 30 without GDM)
      will collect breastmilk at 2 months postpartum.
