  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of a multi-level behavior change
      intervention designed to promote toilet construction, exclusive toilet use and maintenance in
      peri-urban communities of Tamil Nadu. The intervention leverages two years of formative
      research and reflects a norms and network-centric approach that will employ dynamic
      information dissemination to signal others' sanitation practices while also addressing other
      barriers to the adoption of improved sanitation practices. The study will determine whether
      those who received the interventions had significant improvements in toilet usage compared to
      those who did not. Qualitative research will help assess exposure and reactions to the
      intervention in these communities.

      The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of a multi-level behavior change
      intervention designed to promote toilet construction, exclusive toilet use and maintenance in
      peri-urban communities of Tamil Nadu. The intervention leverages two years of formative
      research and reflects a norms and network-centric approach that will employ dynamic
      information dissemination to signal others' sanitation practices while also addressing other
      barriers to the adoption of improved sanitation practices. The study will determine whether
      those who received the interventions had significant improvements in toilet usage compared to
      those who did not.

      For this cluster-randomized trial, communities will be engaged in two rounds of surveys to
      assess toilet ownership, toilet usage practices of their family members and include
      additional questions about beliefs, norms and other factors influencing toilet use.
      Investigators will also conduct a process evaluation to monitor change from baseline to
      endline and identify successful pathways of or bottle-necks to the adoption of improved
      sanitation behaviors. These indicators will include fidelity indicators to assess the quality
      of intervention delivery, level of community participation, behavioral antecedents,
      contextual changes in community and household conditions that may facilitate improved
      behavioral adoption and/or outcomes (e.g., exclusive toilet use). They will also conduct
      qualitative research using observations and semi-structured interviews with respondents and
      stakeholders to assess exposure and reactions to the intervention. They will also assess
      spillover in the control wards using mixed-method assessment tools.

    <description>Exclusive toilet use is measured using self reported use of toilet every time for defecation in the past 2 days. It will be assessed via household survey conducted by trained enumerators and respondents.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Empirical expectations (beliefs of what other's do) regarding toilet ownership, use and maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 12 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Empirical expectation of toilet ownership, use and maintenance refers to individual's self reported belief of the prevalence of other's toilet ownership, use and maintenance respectively in their own community. It will be assessed via household survey using pre-tested indicators.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the proportion of households with improved sanitation facilities</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 12 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An improved sanitation facility is defined as one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact (WHO/UNICEF JMP 2019). It will be assessed through a household survey and direct observations of the sanitation facility by the surveyors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in normative expectations (beliefs of what other think you should do) regarding toilet ownership, use and maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 12 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Normative expectation of toilet ownership, use and maintenance refers to individual's belief of the prevalence of whether the toilet ownership, use and maintenance is approved by others in their community. It will be assessed via household survey using pre-tested indicators.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the usable toilet facilities rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 12 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Usable or functional toilet facility will be defined according using WHO/UNICEF JMP 2019 definitions and ascertained during direct observations of toilet facilities during household surveys.</description>

    <measure>Change in diarrhea prevalence in children under 5 years</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 12 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Diarrhea is defined as 3+ loose or watery stools in 24 hours or 1+ stools with blood in 24 hours. This outcome will be assessed via a household survey conducted between the trained enumerators and participants.</description>
