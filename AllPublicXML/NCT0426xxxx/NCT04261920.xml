      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the preventive effect of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu
      decoction on oxaliplatin induced peripheral neurotoxicity is better than that of simulator,
      and to provide evidence-based medicine basis for the clinical promotion of single medicine
      granule. This trial purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu
      decoction in preventing oxaliplatin induced peripheral neurotoxicity. This trial design type
      is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical study was conducted.
