  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to explore what it is about the experience of chronic pain that may cause
      emotional distress in some young people but not in others, and how particular individual
      characteristics, as well as family factors may contribute to young persons' pain experiences
      and their emotional responses to pain.

      This is a three-part observational follow-up study:

      Part one will explore (a) whether the current sample reports emotional distress, including
      feelings of burdensomeness, hopelessness and thoughts and acts of self-harm, and if young
      people perceive there to be a link between pain and any such feelings of distress, and (b)
      which aspects of the pain experience, if any, are associated with such distress, using
      qualitative and quantitative data.

      Part two will explore potential individual-level and family-level risk and resilience factors
      underpinning the hypothesised relationship between aspects of the pain experience and
      burdensomeness, hopelessness and thoughts and acts of self-harm, using adolescent and
      parental baseline data.

      In part three, adolescent participants will be invited to complete daily diaries on their
      pain experience, three times per day over 7 days, in order to investigate which aspects of
      the pain experience are associated with burdensomeness and hopelessness at follow-up.

      This study has the potential to improve the care of young people with chronic pain, and in
      particular the emotional support that young people receive.
