  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is characterized by the presence of choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV), which consists of abnormal blood vessels originating from the
      choroid that can lead to hemorrhage, fluid exudation, and fibrosis, resulting in
      photoreceptor damage and vision loss.

      The safety and efficacy of brolucizumab were assessed in 2 randomized, multicenter,
      double-masked, active treatment-controlled Phase 3 studies in nAMD patients (the HAWK study
      (RTH258-C001 [NCT02307682]) and the HARRIER study (RTH258-C002 [NCT02434328]). Accordingly, a
      new Phase 3b study (TALON, CRTH258A2303) is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of brolucizumab in a Treat-to-Control (TtC) regimen for the treatment of naïve
      patients with nAMD. In this TtC regimen, patients receive 3 consecutive injections every 4
      weeks and then the injection interval is extended by 4 weeks up to a maximum of a 16-week
      interval. The decision to extend or reduce the injection interval is taken by the
      Investigator at each visit based on his/her judgment of disease activity, according to the
      patient visual and/or anatomic outcomes. If there is no disease activity, the injection
      interval can be extended by 4 weeks ; if disease activity occurs or recurs, the injection
      interval should be shortened accordingly by 4 weeks at a time or to a minimal interval of 4
      weeks. The injection interval can also be maintained if the Investigator deems that the
      patient do not benefit from injection interval adjustment.

      Since all these studies were conducted in a naïve nAMD patient population, no data are
      available on the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab in pretreated nAMD patients who still
      present active exudation.

             required). Patients must have received at least 3 injections of this anti-VEGF in the
             6 months prior to Screening/Baseline.

          5. Presence of residual fluid (IRF or SRF that affects the central subfield under, as
             seen by OCT)

          6. Concomitant conditions or ocular disorders in the study eye, including retinal
             diseases other than nAMD, that, in the judgment of the Investigator, could require
             medical or surgical intervention during the course of the study to prevent or treat
             visual loss that might result from that condition, or that limits the potential to
             gain visual acuity upon treatment with the investigational product.

          7. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the center of the macula in the study

             at the time of Screening/Baseline that in the Investigator's opinion could preclude
             visual function improvement with treatment.

          8. Current vitreous hemorrhage or history of vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye within
             4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline.

             deferoxamine, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, tamoxifen, phenothiazines and
             ethambutol) used during the 6-month period prior to Baseline.

         19. Participation in an investigational drug, biologic, or device study within 30 days or
             the duration of 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is longer)
             prior to Baseline. Note: observational clinical studies solely involving
             over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets are not exclusionary.

         22. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as a systolic value ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic value
             ≥ 100 mmHg. (In case there is an elevated blood pressure measurement, it should be
             repeated after 20 minutes. If the repeat measurement is elevated, then the patient is
             not eligible to be enrolled into the study).

         23. History of a medical condition (disease, metabolic dysfunction with exception of type
             1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory
             finding) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would preclude scheduled study
             visits, completion of the study, or a safe administration of investigational product.

         24. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin or in situ cervical cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5

             classes, or clinically relevant sensitivity to fluorescein dye, as assessed by the
             Investigator.

             Other

         26. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test.

             or less than 6 weeks since sterilization.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at
             least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone
             level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.

         28. Patients mentioned in Articles L.1121-5 to L.1121-8 and L.1122-1-2 of the Code de
             Santé Publique (e.g. minors, protected adults, etc.)
