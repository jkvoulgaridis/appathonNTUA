  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2 part, single-dose and crossover study conducted to assess the
      relative bioavailability of a tablet compared to a capsule of GSK3640254 and to assess the
      effect of food on the GSK3640254 tablet in healthy participants. This study will also
      evaluate the effect of food (fasted, moderate fat meal, and high fat meal) on the
      pharmacokinetics of the GSK3640254 mesylate tablet formulation. In Part 1, participants will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA) in two sequential treatment
      periods; and in Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequences
      (CDE, DEC, or ECD) in three sequential treatment periods. Participants will be randomized to
      receive a single dose of GSK3640254 200 milligram (mg) capsules under moderate fat conditions
      and GSK3640254 200 mg tablets under moderate fat, fasted and high fat conditions in each
      treatment period. Approximately 30 participants will be enrolled.

             participant.

          -  Medical history of cardiac arrhythmias, prior myocardial infarction in the past 3
