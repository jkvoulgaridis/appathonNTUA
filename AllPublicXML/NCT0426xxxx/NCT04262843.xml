      This phase II trial studies how well total marrow and lymphoid irradiation works as a
      conditioning regimen before hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. Total body irradiation can lower the relapse rate
      but has some fatal side effects such as irreversible damage to normal internal organs and
      graft-versus-host disease (a complication after transplantation in which donor's immune cells
      recognize the host as foreign and attack the recipient's tissues). Total body irradiation is
      a form of radiotherapy that involves irradiating the patient's entire body in an attempt to
      suppress the immune system, prevent rejection of the transplanted bone marrow and/or stem
      cells and to wipe out any remaining cancer cells. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) is a more recently developed method of delivering radiation. Total marrow and lymphoid
      irradiation is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow. Total marrow
      and lymphoid irradiation may allow a greater dose of radiation to be delivered to the bone
      marrow as a preparative regimen before hematopoietic cell transplant while causing less side
      effects to normal organs than standard total body irradiation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of the haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT)
      total marrow and lymphoid organ irradiation (TMLI), with high dose post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, as assessed by
      1-year graft versus (vs) host disease-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) rate in each arm (Arm
      A: patients with acute myeloid leukemia [AML] or myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] and Arm B:
      Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidences of relapse/disease progression, and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) in each arm at 100 days, and 1 year post-transplant.

      II. Estimate rate of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 1 year post-transplant.

      III. Estimate rates of acute and chronic GvHD, infections, complete remission and neutrophil
      recovery.

      IV. Describe and characterize cytokine release syndrome (CRS) post-haploidentical HCT with
      TMLI as conditioning regimen and PTCy as GvHD prophylaxis as assessed by incidence, frequency
      and severity.

      V. Further evaluate the safety of this regimen by assessing:

      Va. Adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration.

      Vb. Complications: including acute/chronic GVHD, infection and delayed engraftment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize minimal residual disease from bone marrow aspirates and investigate the
      possible association between TMLI-based regimen and patient's disease status.

      II. Describe the kinetics of immune cell recovery. III. Describe the kinetics of serum
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and GvHD biomarkers.

      IV. Longitudinal and spatial assessment of TMLI effect on bone marrow environment.

      V. Cellular and molecular assessment of TMLI effect on bone marrow environment and TMLI
      effect on the engraftment and disease relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) on days -7 to
      -5, and undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -4 to 0 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV QD on days 3-4 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 5, patients also receive
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor and tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil per institutional
      standard.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice weekly for the first 100
      days post-transplant, twice monthly until 6 months post-transplant, monthly until patient
      discontinues immunosuppressive therapy, and then yearly for 2 years.

               -  (NOTE: Low dose chemotherapy or maintenance chemotherapy given within 7 days of
                  planned study enrollment is permitted. These include: Hydroxyurea,
                  6-meraptopurine, oral methotrexate, vincristine, oral etoposide, and tyrosine
                  kinase inhibitors [TKIs]. FLT-3 inhibitors such as sorafenib, crenolanib,
                  midostaurin can also be given up to 3 days before conditioning regimen.)

          -  Herbal medications dependency

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to study agent

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotics

          -  Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection

          -  Females only: Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical
             study procedures

          -  Patients who had a prior autologous or allogeneic transplant

          -  Patients who had prior radiation therapy of more than 20% of bone marrow containing
             areas or to any area exceeding 2000 cGy

          -  Patients with HLA-matched or partially matched (7/8 or 8/8) related or fully matched
             unrelated donor available to donate

          -  Patients who have received more than 3 prior regimens, where the regimen intent was to
             induce remission

          -  Patients with treatment history including anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g.,
             SGN-CD33 or Mylotarg)

          -  DONOR: Evidence of active infection

          -  DONOR: Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or
             cooperate with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis

          -  DONOR: Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from
             leukapheresis or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy
