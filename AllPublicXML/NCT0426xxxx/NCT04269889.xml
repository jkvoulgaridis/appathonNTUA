  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is treated with steroids. But some people cannot take steroids,
      or steroids don t work. Other patients must get blood transfusions regularly which are time
      consuming and can have significant side effects. The drug eltrombopag can increase red blood
      cells. Researchers want to see if it can help people with DBA and, if so, for how long.

      Objective:

      To study the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in people with DBA who have not responded to
      steroids or could not take them.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 2 and older with DBA who did not respond to steroids or could not take them, or
      their disease has returned despite taking them

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical and medicine history

      Physical exam

      MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the liver.

      Blood and urine tests

      Bone marrow biopsy: A thin needle will remove a marrow sample from the participant s hip
      bone.

      Electrocardiogram

      Participants will take eltrombopag pills once daily for 24 weeks. They will have blood taken
      every 2 weeks.

      Participants will have visits 6 months. At 6 months, they will repeat all the screening tests
      and also have:

      Quality-of-life questionnaire

      Neurodevelopmental test (for participants younger than 18 years)

      If participants blood cell counts improve, they may keep taking eltrombopag for up to 3 more
      years. If so, they will have blood taken every 4 weeks. They will visit NIH every 6 months
      and repeat the above tests.

      Participants will be monitored for up to 3 years after they stop taking eltrombopag. They
      will visit NIH 6 months after treatment ends. If participants blood counts go down after
      treatment ends, they may restart the drug....

    <textblock>
      Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a heritable bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome characterized
      by selective erythroid defects typically presenting within the first year of life as a
      normochromic, macrocytic anemia with reticulocytopenia. More than half of all DBA cases are
      associated with either inherited or spontaneous mutations in ribosomal proteins, making DBA a
      prototypic ribosomopathy . Furthermore, although the primary presentation is isolated anemia,
      as life expectancy has improved, progressive defects in other lineages have now been
      identified, consistent with a long-term stem cell defect. Current standard of care for DBA is
      the use of systemic corticosteroids, the mechanism of which is unclear, although only half
      show an initial response. Even when a response to steroids is observed, long-term steroid
      therapy carries significant morbidity, especially in children or in combination with
      transfusion-associated iron overload, and thus most cannot tolerate high-dose steroids
      long-term. Responses are rare with second-line immunomodulatory agents. Yet other than
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in those patients with healthy matched
      donors, there are no alternative therapies.

      In one model for DBA pathogenesis, the defects lead to an overabundance of the iron-carrying
      moiety heme in primitive erythroid cells, unbound by protein. Free heme is toxic to cells,
      likely exacerbated over time by iron overload due to transfusions. Ongoing work with
      eltrombopag (EPAG) has shown that it is capable of acting as a potent iron chelator,
      including intracellular iron, with evidence that this effect of EPAG can reverse the impact
      of excess heme and elevated reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, in a recent trial of EPAG
      for moderate aplastic anemia or hypoproliferative unilineage cytopenias, we identified a
      robust response to EPAG in the one DBA patient enrolled in this clinical trial. This response
      has been durable over more than three years since study entry but requires continuous EPAG to
      maintain transfusion independence. From these data, we hypothesize that EPAG may be able to
      improve production of red blood cells in DBA patients via chelation of iron and subsequent
      reduction in heme synthesis, resulting in decreased toxicity to bone marrow stem cells and
      developing erythroid cells.

      We will conduct a single-arm, pilot trial in patients with steroid-refractory or
      steroid-intolerant DBA, treating with a fixed dose of EPAG for 6 months to assess safety and
      efficacy at improving hematological manifestations of DBA. Responders at 6 months will be
      able to continue EPAG on the extension part of this protocol for an additional 3 years. We
      will examine the hematologic, molecular, cytogenetic and clonal responses to EPAG in
      responders and non-responders alike. Translational studies will examine the mechanism of
      activity of EPAG in DBA through its effects on iron metabolism, erythroid differentiation,
      apoptosis, global transcriptome and TPO signaling pathways in patient s hematopoietic stem
      and progenitor cells (HSPCs).

             suppression of viral load and CD4 cell count. If drug-drug interactions between
             antiretroviral medications and eltrombopag are suspected, these must be addressed by a
             qualified clinical pharmacist or pharmacologist, and any changes to antiretroviral
             therapy need to be approved in consultation with an Infectious Disease and/or HIV
             specialist prior to enrollment.

             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 30 days after the last dose of eltrompobag. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before

                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had over 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile age appropriate (e.g. generally 40-59 years), history of
                  vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes) in the absence of other medical
                  justification or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment should she be considered
                  not of child bearing potential.

                    -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while
                       taking the study treatment and for 30 days after stopping study treatment
                       and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be
                       used also by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male
                       partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
