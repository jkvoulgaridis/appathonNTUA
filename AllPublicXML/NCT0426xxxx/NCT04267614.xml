      This study is to investigate the effect of etanercept in early versus delayed referral for
      management of rheumatoid arthritis patients assessing real-world patient data entered in the
      Iraq National Center of Rheumatology database between May 2012 and May 2017.

Impact of early referral for management (etanercept) defined as: will compare the DAS28 and CDAI for early referral group (according to above definition of early) with DAS28 and CDAI of delayed of referral group.</description>
