    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a range of pre-clinical cardiometabolic biomarkers can be
      improved via regular intervals of standing and light-intensity physical activity in
      real-world office environments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being conducted to determine whether a range of pre-clinical
      cardiometabolic biomarkers (measured via gut microbiome, blood draw) can be improved via
      regular intervals of standing and light-intensity physical activity (i.e., leisurely walking)
      in real-world office environments. This trial is meant to generate pilot data which will lead
      to additional clinical trials.

      Primary Hypothesis: Increasing both standing and light-intensity physical activity will
      improve biomarkers of metabolic function, as measured by blood metabolites and differential
      abundance of gut microbiome composition, compared to a control condition of normal workplace
      behavior.

    <measure>Change in 2-hour postprandial area-under-the-curve blood glucose at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to wear the Abbott Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitor during the usual behavior condition (week 1) and both experimental conditions (weeks 2-3 and weeks 5-6). Research staff will insert the CGM sensor at the screening and study visits. The training for this insertion will be conducted by a registered research nurse. The CGM sensors have been designed and tested to be worn continuously for up to 14 days. Sensors will be placed and removed by trained research staff at appropriate time-points throughout the study. Postprandial period will follow a standardize lunch meal. Area-under-the-curve calculations will be based on 2 hours following delivery of this lunch meal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in baseline workplace standing time at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to wear an activPAL acceleometer throughout the entire intervention period. Data from the devices will be downloaded at each study visit. The activPAL device is worn on the right thigh and is equipped with low energy Bluetooth and will communicate wirelessly with the provided smartphone application to provide feedback to the participant and compliance with the protocol. Workplace time will be assessed by a self-report log and activPAL time will be extracted based on these reports.</description>

    <measure>Change in fasting blood glucose at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After verifying fasting for 10-12 hours, a blood sample (about 15 ml, approximately 1 tablespoon) will be collected via venipuncture to measure marker of glucose. After withdrawal, blood will be centrifuged at 1,100 x g at 4°C for 20 minutes, and serum, plasma and erythrocytes will be aliquoted and stored at -80 degrees Celsius for subsequent analysis upon sample collection completion. Blood will be drawn by Arizona Biomedical Collaborative Laboratory clinical staff.</description>

    <description>Femoral Artery Flow Mediated Dilation (FAFMD) Endothelium-dependent dilation of the femoral artery will be measured using B-mode ultrasound (Terason uSmart 3300+™, Burlington MA) using guidelines set forth by the Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force.</description>
