        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or findings on physical examination of any significant disease or disorder
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, influence the results of the study or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Current diagnosis of asthma (other than seasonal during the birch pollen allergy
             season), requiring Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 2 or higher treatment, or

             months before Screening.

          -  History of asthma deterioration that resulted in emergency treatment or
             hospitalisation in the 12 months before screening, or a life-threatening asthma attack
             at any time in the past.

          -  Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) &lt; 70% of predicted, regardless of asthma
             status at screening or baseline assessment at the first dosing visit.

          -  History of severe drug allergy, severe angioedema or systemic allergic reaction of
             Grade 3 or greater, according to the World Allergy Organization (WAO) scale, due to
