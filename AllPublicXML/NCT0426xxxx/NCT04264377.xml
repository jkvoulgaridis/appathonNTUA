  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic asthma is a complex and heterogeneous disease caused by excessive responses to
      inhaled allergens. Current medication, including corticosteroids and bronchodilators, does
      not act on the origin of inflammation but rather combats symptoms, leaving many patients
      uncontrolled. Airway epithelium is critical for the initiation and progression of asthma
      pathology.

      We will include a 52 subjects divided over two groups: ongoing asthma (26 patients) and
      non-asthmatic healthy controls (26 subjects) in a cross-sectional study. All subjects will be
      extensively clinically characterized including respiratory symptoms/questionnaires, in- and
      expiratory CT-scans, and parameters of large and small airway function and inflammation. In
      addition, blood and nasal epithelial brushes will be obtained to study the genetic and
      epigenetic mechanisms of asthma. Finally, bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsies and brushes
      will be performed under conscious sedation. Bronchial biopsies from both patient groups will
      be used for single cell transcriptional analysis.
