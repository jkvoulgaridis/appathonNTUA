  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to effectively use a client-centered community-based intervention
      to engage people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in healthcare that helps reduce risky behaviors and
      lower infectious disease risks. Participants in the intervention group of this study will
      undergo a 12-week intensive multilevel harm reduction case-management intervention at three
      rural Vivent Health offices geared towards reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), and overdose risks in PWIDs. Prevention Navigators (PNs) at each
      office will help coordinate referrals to reduce substance use disorder and increase
      engagement in the substance use disorder care cascades. PNs will also engage participants in
      HIV, HCV, and sexually transmitted infections(STIs) care cascades.

      This project will be conducted by an experienced, interdisciplinary team working across
      academic, public health, and non-government sectors. The main community partner Vivent
      Health, formerly known as the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin (ARCW), is a unique,
      state-wide organization that provides harm reduction services, including syringe services and
      confidential HIV and HCV testing, to clients at 10 fixed sites and numerous mobile units
      reaching all 72 Wisconsin counties. Based on investigator's preliminary studies and prior
      collaborations, investigator has selected 6 counties in rural Wisconsin, three of which
      investigator will deploy and evaluate the Client-Centered Prevention Home intervention model
      at Vivent Health field offices located within these service areas. Participants in the
      intervention will undergo a 12-week intensive multilevel harm reduction case-management
      intervention geared towards coordinating referrals to reduce substance use disorder and
      increase engagement in the substance use disorder care cascades, and reduce vulnerability to
      HIV, STIs, and HCV and increase in engagement in the HIV, STI, and HCV care cascades.
      Participants in the intervention arm will work with Prevention Navigators to undergo a risk
      assessment and identify problems and create goals that they want to achieve. Each session
      after that will be used to review the needs assessment and goals. During their last meeting,
      participants and prevention navigators will develop a discharge plan that will enable the
      participants to work on their goals on their own. Participants at all six sites will undergo
      rapid testing for HIV, HCV, and STIs, and fill out survey questionnaires to evaluate risk
      behaviors, intervention effectiveness, and general needs of the communities. There are three
      groups in this study which consist of intervention, delayed intervention (3 month wait-list
      period before intervention begins), and a nonintervention control group.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be enrolled using a parallel crossover and cross-site study design.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the addiction treatment accessibility and utilization as assessed by change in Likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following questions will be asked on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1=strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree:
If I wanted to start a medical treatment for opioid or heroine addiction, I could easily get into a methadone program
If I wanted to start medical treatment for opioid or heroin addiction, I could easily get buprenorphine or Suboxone or Subutex.
An increase in the Likert scale among intervention participants is associated with increased access to addiction treatment programs compared to the controls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the addiction treatment accessibility and utilization as assessed by change in frequency of &quot;Yes&quot; answers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following questions will be asked with yes or no answers.
In the last 3 months, have you gone to a self-help group like Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, Celebrate Recovery, or Rational Recovery?
In the past 3 months, have you received outpatient counseling from a provider or program?
In the past 3 months, have you stayed overnight at a residential or inpatient drug treatment facility?
In the past 3 months, have you been in detox?
In the past 3 months, have you stayed overnight at a sober house?
In the past 3 months, have you gotten buprenorphine maintenance medication-like Suboxone or Subutex-from a doctor or program?
In the past 3 months, have you gotten methadone maintenance from a clinic?
In the past 3 months, have you gotten buprenorphine shots - like Sublocade - from a doctor or program?
Among the intervention group, an increase number of &quot;yes&quot; answers over time will show an improvement in this outcome, compared to the control group.</description>

    <measure>Change in the risk of viral hepatitis as assessed by change in Likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following question will be asked on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1=strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree.
a. I am certain that I got all 3 recommended shots for Hepatitis B.
A shift to a total score of 5 would show improvement in this outcome. In combination of viral hepatitis prevalence, investigators are interested to know the change in hepatitis risk. This question will ask about Hepatitis B vaccination specifically.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the risk of HIV as assessed by change in Likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following questions will be asked to gauge ease of accessing condoms and clean injecting equipment to assess how risky the participants behaviors are in relation to HIV transmission.
It's easy for me to get new, clean syringes or needles.
It's easy for me and my sex partners to get condoms.
Questions will be answered on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1=strongly disagree and 5=strongly agree. An increase in the Likert scale among intervention participants is associated with increased access to HIV prevention compared to the controls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the risk of HIV as assessed by risky behavior frequencies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Six questions will be asked to gauge frequency of safe injection and sex behaviors that reduce the risk of HIV.

On average, how many cigarettes do you smoke a day?</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>

How much do you fear you will lose your friends because you use drugs?
How much do you fear family will reject you because you use drugs?
