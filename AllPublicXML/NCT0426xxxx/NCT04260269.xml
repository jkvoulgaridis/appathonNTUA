  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate cardiotoxicity during re-challenge of a
      different modality of fluoropyrimidine (primary end-point S-1 and secondary any other
      fluoropyrimidine) after having perceived cardiotoxicity with a fluoropyrimidine based regimen
      previously. The patient population is being treated for solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy agents, such as 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine, are
      occasionally associated with cardiotoxicity that may manifest as chest pain, ECG alterations,
      cardiac arrhythmia, and rarely myocardial infarction and sudden death. Clinical
      fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity is infrequent (1-8% of patients), but subclinical toxicity
      may be much more common (up to one third of patients). The underlying mechanisms are not well
      understood, but they may include abnormal coronary artery contractility or spasm, and
      myocardial toxicity. Cardiotoxicity may be less frequent with S-1 (a combination of tegafur,
      gimeracil and oteracil at a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1) as compared with 5-fluorouracil and
      capecitabine, but head-to-head comparisons are lacking.

      Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients who have cardiotoxicity on other fluoropyrimidines
      may be successfully treated with S-1. The purpose of this retrospective study is to compare
      different 5-fluorouracil-based dosing modalities and S-1, and compare cardiotoxicity during
      these treatments.

      The patient population was treated for solid tumors with a 5-fluorouracil based regimen and
      had a cardiac event grade 1-4. All patients were re-challenged with a different
      fluoropyrimidine or S-1 and assessed for cardiotoxicity during re-challenge.

    <description>This is the assessment of a specific evaluation of cardiac safety for patients with solid tumors who have experienced cardiotoxicity grade 1-4 during treatment with a fluoropyrimidine based treatment and are re-challenged with a different fluoropyrimidine.
This multicentre, retrospective database is built to assess the impact on the cardiac and global safety of two different fluoropyrimidine based treatment regimens, of which the first has caused cardiotoxicity grade 1-4.
Cardiac data will be collected by medical record review from initiation of first fluoropyrimidine-based treatment and switch to second fluoropyrimidine-based treatment until death or last follow-up. Basic demographics, cancer and treatment information from the whole course of cancer until death or last follow-up.</description>
