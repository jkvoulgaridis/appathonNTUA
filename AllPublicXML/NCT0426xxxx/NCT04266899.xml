  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of foot drop stimulation (FDS) on gait
      rehabilitation of post-stroke subjects with mild, moderate and severe compromise.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stroke subjects are going to perform the walking training with Foot drop stimulator on
      the treadmill. All the evaluations will be performed with a foot drop stimulator turned off
      and on. One month later, that finished the intensive treatment; the participants were also
      evaluated only without the stimulation of FDS.

    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (2 weeks) and Post 3 (1 month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated by means single miniaturized inertial sensor (G-Sensor®, BTS Bioengineering, Italy). The device collects the values of linear accelerations along three orthogonal axes (antero-posterior (AP) corresponding to the walking direction, medio-lateral (ML), and supero-inferior (V)). The Harmonic Ration is the ratio between the sum of the amplitudes of even harmonics and the sum of the amplitudes of odd harmonics calculated via the discrete Fourier transform along the antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC) directions; the opposite ratio is calculated along the latero-lateral axis (LL).</description>
