  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single center, open label, multi-cohort platform study to identify a
      signature in tumor tissues, blood or stool that might help identify participants who are more
      likely to experience tumor shrinkage or side effects from the combination of the study drugs
      durvalumab and oleclumab. In addition, this study will see if participants with certain types
      of advanced cancer benefit from the experimental drug combination of durvalumab and
      oleclumab, will evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and oleclumab, and to
      understand the effects that durvalumab and oleclumab have at a molecular level in tumor cells
      and their effects on the immune system. This study will look at subjects with locally
      advanced or recurrent/metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), non-small-cell
      carcinoma (NSCLC) and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN).

      Within each cancer type, 40 patients will be enrolled (for a total of 120 patients on study):
      20 patients will be enrolled with locally advanced disease (&quot;window&quot;) and treated with
      durvalumab 1500 mg given by IV x 1 dose and oleclumab 3000 mg x 2 doses every 2 weeks prior
      to definitive therapy (e.g. surgery), and 20 patients will be enrolled with
      recurrent/metastatic (&quot;metastatic&quot;) disease and treated with durvalumab 1500 mg given by IV
      every 4 weeks and oleclumab 3000 mg given by IV every 2 weeks x 4 doses then IV every 4 weeks
      till disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of subject consent, or another discontinuation
      reason. For locally advanced PDAC patients, approximately 10 of the 20 subjects may receive
      6-8 cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) prior to the administration of durvalumab and
      oleclumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the combination of oleclumab (anti-cluster of differentiation
      [CD]73) with durvalumab (anti programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) will demonstrate
      adequate safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity in subjects with locally advanced or
      recurrent/metastatic: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), and that circulating free
      methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) can yield
      cancer type-agnostic predictive biomarker(s) of response and/or toxicity in subjects
      receiving this combination.

    <intervention_name>Durvalumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against human PD-L1. Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 with high affinity and blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and cluster of differentiation (CD)80. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediating antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Oleclumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Oleclumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 lambda monoclonal antibody (mAb) with a triple mutation in the heavy chain constant region for reduced effector function. Oleclumab selectively binds to cluster of differentiation 73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) (CD73) and inhibits CD73-associated ectonucleotidase activity, thereby inhibiting the CD73-mediated production of immunosuppressive adenosine. Extracellular adenosine contributes to the immunosuppressive effects of both regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, among others. This, in turn, leads to increased antitumor immunity.</description>
