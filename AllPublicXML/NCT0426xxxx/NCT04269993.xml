    <textblock>
      This laboratory study will investigate the impact of cannabis on pain, affect, and
      inflammation among patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis (n = 76). Two cannabis
      formulations will be administered via vaporization (placebo and medium THC [1-5%]/medium CBD
      [1-5%]) across two experimental sessions using a counter-balanced, double-blind, crossover
      design.

      This laboratory study will investigate the impact of cannabis on pain, affect, and
      inflammation among patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis (n = 76). Two cannabis
      formulations will be administered via vaporization (placebo and medium THC [1-5%]/medium CBD
      [1-5%]) across two experimental sessions using a counter-balanced, double-blind, crossover
      design. Blood will be collected during each session (pre-vaporization, 10 minutes
      post-vaporization, 60 minutes post-vaporization). Self-reported pain and affect will be
      assessed at the same time points. The effect of cannabis on pain, affect, and inflammatory
      biomarkers will be assessed. The study will recruit 76 patients to obtain a final sample of
      66 with complete data (15% attrition). This study will be the first to investigate the effect
      of cannabis on pain, affect, and markers of inflammation among patients with rheumatoid or
      psoriatic arthritis. This study has the potential to guide clinical decisions pertaining to
      use of cannabis to treat arthritis symptoms with more precise recommendations regarding
      cannabis formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. current RA or PA diagnosis with active arthritis not adequately controlled by standard
             medication

          2. stable prescribed steroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) use for at least
             1 month and stable use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS; e.g., tumor
             necrosis factor inhibitors) for 3 months prior to enrollment (all must be maintained
             throughout the study) as confirmed by the subject's treating physician

          3. English-speaking

          4. negative urine toxicology screen for cannabis and other drugs

          5. negative pregnancy test

          6. not nursing

          7. use of contraception during the study for women of childbearing age due to potential
             negative effects of cannabis on a fetus

             Exclusion Criteria:

          8. greater than zero breath alcohol concentration

          9. presence of a DSM-5 diagnosis of psychosis or panic disorder as assessed by the Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and not suicidal [past month ideation
             or intent]

         10. self-report of serious adverse reaction to cannabis in the past year

         11. smoking more than 20 tobacco cigarettes per day

         12. body mass index below 18.5 or above 30 kg/m2 range confirmed during medical exam as
             extreme BMIs can influence drug blood levels and BMIs in the obese range are
             considered cardiovascular risk factors

         13. presence of any severe cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disorder, or history of
             epilepsy

         14. below 18 or above 65 years of age

         15. absence of lifetime cannabis exposure (reduces the risk of adverse psychoactive
             effects)

         16. use of cannabis in the past 6 months before commencement of study participation and
             throughout the study as confirmed via urine toxicology screening

         17. below minimum self-reported pain level of 30/100 on a visual analog scale (VAS)
             pre-study enrollment via telephone and at baseline due to potential variability in
             pain level
