  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to study a specific group of PD patients, carriers of mutations in the
      glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, which is the most common genetic risk factor for PD and is a
      harbinger of aggressive cognitive and motor decline. Approximately 12-17% of PD patients
      undergoing DBS are GBA mutation carriers. GBA mutation carriers with PD have a specific
      phenotype characterized by more significant motor dysfunction and reduced short-term visual
      memory function compared with their non-GBA counterparts. Thus as GBA mutation carriers have
      a &quot;signature&quot; phenotype, we hypothesize that these GBA mutation carriers have a unique
      &quot;signature&quot; of oscillatory activity that can be distinguished from non-mutation carriers
      during motor activation and during cognitive tasks. Identification of this &quot;signature&quot; will
      provide critical information that is required to: 1) understand the underlying
      neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for the aggressive disease course of GBA associated
      PD, and 2) further develop customized adaptive DBS systems.
