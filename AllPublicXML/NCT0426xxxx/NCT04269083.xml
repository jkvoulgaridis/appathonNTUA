  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery has been accepted as the standard of care
      for resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ). However,
      in a large part of the cases the tumor is extremely resistant to chemoradiotherapy, and those
      patients do not benefit from this treatment but are exposed to its negative consequences such
      as toxicity and delayed surgical therapy. The hypothesis is that a biomarker-driven
      therapeutic strategy in which patients will receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy or upfront
      surgery based on the basal tumor expression of BIRC3 could improve the R0 resection rate if
      compared with a standard strategy in unselected patients.

    <textblock>
      BoRgES trial is a multicenter, randomized phase II study of BIRC3-expression directed
      preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
      and EGJ. The main objective of this proposal is to provide evidence for a novel therapeutic
      strategy with enormous significance for patients affected by this disease.

      Only a part of the patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma benefit from neoadjuvant therapy,
      and the clinical efficacy of chemoradiotherapy is reduced by the pre-existence of cellular
      drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify patients who could not benefit
      from preoperative treatment. The study will define an innovative therapeutic strategy
      directed by the expression of BIRC3 as a predictive marker for discriminating patients who
      will most likely be resistant to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

    <description>fresh specimens from the tumour and normal mucosa will be collected endoscopically at diagnosis and placed immediately into RNALater to isolate RNA. The mRNA expression of BIRC3 will be quantified using a SYBR green-based real-time PCR analysis; the BIRC3 median expression in normal mucosa samples will be used as calibrator. Patients with a tumor expression level of BIRC3 lower than the established cutoff will receive a standard carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen with concurrent radiotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with an expression of BIRC3 higher or equal than the cutoff (chemoradiation resistant patients) will undergo upfront surgery.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and EGJ (Siewert I/II) surgical
             resectable (cT2-4a, N0-1, M0), as determined by Endoscopic Ultra Sound (EUS) and or
             PET-TC scan. cT1N1 tumors are eligible, T1N0 tumors and in situ carcinoma are not
             eligible.

          -  If tumor extends below the EGJ junction into the proximal stomach, the bulk of the
             tumor must involve the esophagus or GE junction. The tumor must not extend more than 2
             cm into the stomach (Siewert III). Gastric cancers with minor involvement of the GE
             junction or esophagus are not eligible.

          -  Age &gt;18, no age upper limit unless patient would be unable to tolerate
             chemoradiotherapy.

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.
