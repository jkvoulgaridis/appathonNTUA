  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the impact of smartphone application on adherence to a
      physical exercise program in chronic low back pain patients.

      Adherence to a physical exercise program will be assessed at the start of the protocol, at
      three weeks and six months.

      A control group will benefit from conventional care in a rehabilitation center and an
      intervention group will benefit from a conventional care in a rehabilitation center
      accompanied by education in the use of a smartphone application including physical exercises
      and information about low back pain.

      The hypothesis of the search is that adherence is better in intervention group than control
      group at 6 months due to education in the use of smartphone application.
