  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of virtual reality
      (VR) technology in the use of behavioral activation (BA) as a treatment for major depressive
      disorder (MDD). The secondary purpose of this study is to examine whether any evidence of
      clinical efficacy exists for VR delivered BA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a treatment development trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to BA in VR, BA
      in real-life, or a waitlist control group. The former two groups will follow a BA protocol
      developed for primary care settings over a four-week treatment period. This study is taking
      place over Zoom, due to COVID-19.

    <measure>How well can participants tolerate the VR-BA treatment?</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined by the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, which names 16 adverse symptoms and asks participants to circle as compared to baseline: No more than usual, Slightly more than usual, Moderately more than usual, or Severely more than usual.</description>

    <measure>How present did individuals in the VR-BA treatment feel?</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Presence Questionnaire, which asks three questions and asks the participants to circle either Not at all, Slightly, Moderately, Strongly, or Very Strongly.</description>

    <measure>Clinical efficacy of using VR as a tool to deliver BA</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>How participants' depression scores PHQ-9 change over time using VR-BA compared to BA in real life and a waitlist control. The PHQ-9 is a 9-question screener with a score range of 0-29, with 29 indicating the most severe depression and 0 indicating a lack of depression symptoms.</description>
