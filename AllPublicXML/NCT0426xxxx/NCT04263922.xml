      This is a multicentre prospective, randomized, double-blind and imitation, positive-drug
      parallel controlled clinical trail. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of Huaiqihuang Granule in patients with CKD stage 3 primary glomerulonephritis.

      Chronic kidney disease is a common disease that affects health seriously. In some regions of
      China, the morbidity of this kind of disease is as high as 10.8%. Primary glomerulopathy is
      one of the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease, which occupied 50%-60%. However, at
      present, there is still a lack of effective means for the treatment of primary
      glomerulonephritis in CKD stage 3. Huaiqihuang Granule is a kind of Chinese herbal medicine
      compound preparation, Previous researches showed that Huaiqihuang has a comprehensive effect
      on primary glomerulonephritis. In this study, there were about 40 first-class hospitals
      participating in. We planned to enroll 466 participants, who will be randomly divided into
      the Huaiqihuang Granule group (experimental group) and the Valsartan group (control group).
      All participants will take medication for 48 weeks, and investigators will follow up
      participates at weeks 0, 8,16, 24, 32, 40, 48.
