    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the Individual Managing Fatigue Program
      in people with Parkinson`s disease. The Managing Fatigue Program, a six-week, self-management
      energy conservation course, focuses on strategies that help people with fatigue to make
      changes to save and use their energy to accomplish their daily activities. Several studies
      have adapted and evaluated different delivery formats of the Managing Fatigue Program in
      conditions similar to Parkinson's disease demonstrating that the Managing Fatigue Program is
      effective in reducing fatigue, depression, sleep problems, and improving quality of life,
      participation and self-efficacy. However, the Managing Fatigue Program is yet to be evaluated
      in people with Parkinson's disease. This feasibility study, using a mixed-methods approach,
      nested in a pilot randomized control design, will evaluate the feasibility of the Individual
      Managing Fatigue Program from the perspectives of people with Parkinson's disease, and
      prepare for a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      This study will collect qualitative and quantitative data using feasibility, standard outcome
      measures, and group discussions. Using multiple recruitment strategies, 50 participants will
      be recruited and will be randomly assigned to two groups; n=25 in each of the experiment and
      control groups. The study outcome measures will be administered at three times during the
      study; pre-test, post-test, and a three-month follow up.

      The results of this study will determine whether it is feasible to do a full-scale RCT in the
      future. If the known beneficial effects of the Managing Fatigue program extend to the PD
      population, this research will be the evidence needed to support the integration of this
      novel solution into the care of people with PD.

      The specific aims of this study are:

      Aim 1. To evaluate the feasibility of the Individual Managing Fatigue Program (IMFP)
      protocol.

      Using surveys and focus groups, the sub-aims are to evaluate the relevance, usability,
      acceptability, perceived impact of the IMFP and logistical features (time, location,
      duration) of the IMFP for individuals with PD.

      Aim 2. To prepare for a full-scale RCT. By conducting a pilot RCT, the sub-aims are to (1)
      assess the trial recruitment strategy based on the enrollment, completion and attrition
      rates, and variation in socio-demographic features of participants; (2) evaluate the
      responsiveness and sensitivity of potential outcome measures; and (3) use data arising from
      differences between the IMFP and control arms to inform a power calculation for sample size
      of a definitive RCT.

      This protocol has been approved by the Dalhousie Health Sciences Research Ethics Board (ref:
      2019-4954).

      Sample Size Calculation: As a pilot study, a power calculation is not strictly required.
      However, in preparation for the current study, investigators conducted both a sample size
      calculation and consulted previous literature to inform our estimation. To calculate the
      sample size, type-1 error was set at 5% and type-2 error was set at 20% for a power of 80%.
      Effect sizes were taken from available studies as follows: for the MFI, the effect size of
      -0.664 and for the COPM the effect size of 0.37. The results indicate that a total sample
      size of 42 participants will be required using the minimum effect size for the COPM.
      Estimating an attrition rate of 20%, a convenience sample of 50 participants (25 in each
      group) will be recruited from across the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), Canada.

      This sample size selection aligns with recommendations for pilot studies by other researchers
      who have suggested that a minimum sample size of 24 to 50 is required for pilot feasibility
      studies . In another study by Hertzog (2008), a minimum sample of 10-25 people per group for
      feasibility studies is recommended.

      Recruitment: Individuals for this study will be recruited in several different ways from
      Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Investigators will recruit using 1) web-based
      advertisements on the International Chronic and Complex Conditions Research Group website and
      KIJIJI, 2) posters at the Parkinson Society Maritime Region's office and 3) social media
      (Twitter, Facebook), 4) Community TV station public advertising and 5) word of mouth.

      Data Collection-Aim 1: This aim will be achieved using data collected from only the
      experimental group.

      Registered occupational therapists will deliver the IMFP. Therapists graduate with the
      knowledge and skills to treat people with neurological conditions. All therapists will be
      required to successfully complete an online training session prior to participation. They
      will learn about the IMFP and the current evidence-based guidelines and research about
      working with individuals with PD.

      The therapists will be instructed to report to the study supervisor and the principal
      researcher if there are any safety complications during the sessions.

      Feasibility Questionnaires (experimental group only): Two feasibility questionnaires,
      developed by the research team based on the purposes of the study and the program's
      intentions, will be administered. Questionnaire #1 will evaluate the relevance,
      acceptability, and usability of each session. Participants in the experimental group will
      complete Feasibility Questionnaire #1 weekly, after each session. Feasibility Questionnaire
      #2 will evaluate the relevance, acceptability, usability, and logistical aspects of the whole
      program at the completion of the program. Feasibility Questionnaire #1, and Feasibility
      Questionnaires #2 will be completed by participants in the experimental group using sealed
      envelopes to reduce the bias of the measurement. Data collected from Feasibility
      Questionnaires #1 and 2 will be entered into a Stata dataset by the principal researcher
      following the completion of all data collection. This will ensure that this researcher
      remains masked to group allocation during all other data collection.

      Focus Groups: After completion of the program, 15 participants will be recruited to
      participate in focus groups (n=5) using maximum variation sampling based on disease duration,
      fatigue severity, and gender. Participants will be provided additional information about the
      focus groups and be asked to provide a separate informed consent prior to participating.
      Anonymity and confidentially cannot be guaranteed during focus groups, however, participants
      will be asked to keep the confidentiality of other group participants. Participants will be
      advised to only disclose the information they are willing to disclose. An experienced
      research assistant, who is independent of the research, will conduct the focus groups.
      Participants will be encouraged to discuss the feasibility of the program (relevancy,
      usability, acceptability, and logistics), barriers to completion of the program, and their
      perceived impact/changes (improvements/adverse events). The focus groups will be managed
      using an interview guide, developed by the research team.

      Data collection -Aim 2: The principle researcher who will be masked to group allocation will
      assess all participants at baseline, post-test, and three months following completion of the
      program. There are six outcome measures in this study to measure fatigue impact, occupational
      performance, occupational balance, quality of life, sleep quality and self-efficacy. All
      measurements in this study are in pen and paper form.

      Data Analysis-Aim 1: Data from the Feasibility Questionnaires #1 and2 will be collected using
      a five-point Likert scale (Likert, 1932) (0 = 'strongly disagree' to 4 = 'strongly agree).
      Data from questionnaires will be entered into and analyzed using STATA software (release 15
      for Windows). Data will be analysed using descriptive analysis (means, medians and standard
      deviations).

      Focus groups will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Any potentially identifying
      information will be removed prior to analysis. Data will be evaluated using the six-stage
      content analysis framework by Braun and Clarke (2014). Data will be managed using the NVivo
      qualitative data analysis software (QSR International Pty Ltd., Version 11, 2015). The raw
      data achieved from the group discussions will be coded without any changes in the meaning.
      Coded material will be categorized semantically until themes emerge. Codes and themes will be
      reviewed and refined until the final distinctive themes can be created. The final themes and
      attributes will be compared with literature.

      Data Analysis-Aim 2: All data for Aim 2 will first be entered into the Stata software
      (release 15 for Windows). After data entry, data will be cleaned. Data will be examined for
      skewing, outliers, and systematic missing data. Original data will be double checked to
      correct errors. Extreme outliers, or erroneous data points that might bias the results of our
      research will be identified to be double checked. Outliers, defined as greater than ±2SD will
      be removed from the data if they are less than 5% of all data.

      Missing data at the item level will be managed based on the protocol with the algorithm of
      measurement tools. If the scoring algorithm does not provide for missing data, values will be
      imputed using mean substitution. Missing values at the level of measurement tools will be
      managed by mean substitution.

      Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations
      will be computed for study variables. Frequencies and proportions will be calculated for
      categorical data (ex. demographic data), while mean and standard deviation will be calculated
      for continuous data (questionnaires and outcome measures).

      Data will be cleaned, to 1) examine the required sample size for future RCTs, 2) evaluate
      sensitivity, and, 3) evaluate responsiveness the sample size calculation for future RCTs.
      After data is cleaned, investigators will calculate the effect sizes. Effect sizes will be
      calculated by dividing the mean differences between study groups by the standard deviation
      over the duration of the study.

      To analyse the sensitivity of the measures, investigators will use the form of ratio of
      effect size in which, the numerator of the ration is the average change observed in a study
      population between baseline and follow-up scores (mean differences) The denominators of these
      ratios is a measure of the variation observed (SD) . Measurement tools with the highest
      effect size and the smallest significant level are the most sensitive measures to change. In
      regard to responsiveness of measures, measurement tools that have higher levels of
      variability in participants at baseline, in relation to mean change scores, will have a
      smaller effect and therefore, are less responsive.

      Analysis of the effect sizes will adjust for depression measured by the Geriatric Depression
      Scale-15 (GDS-15) and PD severity using the modified Hoehn and Yahr (HY). The GDS-15 is a
      short yes/no self-report measure used to screen for depression in the elderly. Although not
      extensively tested in PD, it appears to have adequate discriminant validity for a diagnosis
      of major and minor depressive disorder in PD, at a cut-off of 4/5 . The modified Hoehn and
      Yahr scale (HY) is a widely used clinical rating scale which identifies the broad categories
      of motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). It includes seven stages of &quot;unilateral
      involvement only&quot;, &quot;unilateral and axial involvement&quot;, &quot;bilateral involvement without
      impairment of balance&quot;, &quot;mild symptoms on both sides, with recovery when the 'pull' test is
      given&quot;, &quot;Mild to moderate bilateral disease; some postural instability; Physically
      independent&quot; , &quot;Severe disability; Still able to walk or stand unassisted&quot; ,
      &quot;Wheelchair-bound or bedridden unless aided&quot;.

      The efficiency of the recruitment strategies will be examined using data from the number of
      individuals who contact the research team, the number of participants who meet the study
      criteria, the number who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow-up (attrition rates),
      and the variation in sociodemographic characteristics of the participants who enrolled in the
      study. To collect this data, the main researcher will log all of this information throughout
      the study for each recruitment strategy, separately, and collectively.

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline fatigue impact to six weeks later at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue impact will be measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) (Smets et al., 1995). The MFI is a self-report fatigue tool with 20 items measuring five dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motion, and Reduced Activity. Elbers and colleagues (2012) evaluated the MFI in the PD population (N=153). After combining General Fatigue and Physical Fatigue dimensions they reported the reliability and validity of the four-domain scale (Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation, and reduced activity) as higher than the original five-domain scale. Testing of the MFI shows good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha &gt;0.80) and construct validity compared to a Visual Analogue Scale measuring fatigue (0.22&lt;r&lt;0.78) (Smets et al., 1995).</description>

    <description>Occupational balance will be measured with the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ) (Wagman &amp; Håkansson, 2014). The OBQ is an 11-item measure developed by Wagman et al., (2014), which assesses individuals' satisfaction and perception with the amount and variation of meaningful occupations. The OBQ measures satisfaction with the amount of time that one takes to accomplish tasks. It uses a 4-level ordinal response scale for each item ranging from 0 &quot;completely disagree&quot; to 3 &quot;completely agree&quot;. The OBQ total score ranges from 0 (no occupational balance) to 35 (maximum occupational balance). The psychometric properties of the OBQ have not been explored in PD. However, in the general population, it has shown good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= 0.936) and test, re-test reliability (Spearman's Rho= 0.926) for its total score (N=67). Neither ceiling nor floor effects were reported (Håkansson, Wagman, &amp; Hagell, 2019).</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline occupational performance to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (Law, M. Baptiste, S., Carswell, A. McColl, M. A., Polatajko, H. &amp; Pollock, 1998). The COPM was selected since it has proven to be sensitive to change and was able to detect significant differences between study groups at three months (mean difference =1.2 (95% CI 0.8-1.6) and after 6 months follow-up (mean differences= 0.9 ( 95%CI 0.5-1.3) (I. Sturkenboom et al., 2013). The COPM is a client-centred, standardized, cost-effective, occupation-focused measure used in occupational therapy. It is an individualized outcome measure administered using a semi-structured interview. It measures occupational performance and occupational satisfaction (Law, M. Baptiste, S., Carswell, A. McColl, M. A., Polatajko, H. &amp; Pollock, 1998).</description>

    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life-8 (PDQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline quality of life to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured with the Parkinson`s Disease Quality of Life-8 (PDQ-8) (Tan et al., 2004). The PDQ-8 is a short-form version of the Parkinson Disease Questionaire-39 which assesses the impact of PD on HRQoL over the past month. The PDQ-8 is a summary index with eight items, each representing one dimension of the PDQ-39 (Mobility, Activities of Daily Living, Emotional Well-being, Stigma, Social Support, Cognition, Communication, and Bodily Discomfort). It uses a 0-4 response scale. Scores are summed, then converted into a percentage. Lower scores indicate better quality of life (Peto et al., 1995). The PDQ-8 psychometric properties have been confirmed in several studies (Franchignoni, Giordano, &amp; Ferriero, 2008; Katsarou et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2009; Tan, Luo, Nazri, Li, &amp; Thumboo, 2004). Franchignon et al (2008) and Tan et al (2004) demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.72, 0.81) and construct validity between PDQ-8 and a measure of autonomy and</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline sleep quality to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse et al., 1989). PSQI is the most common assessment tool used to evaluate sleep quality (Mollayeva et al., 2016). It is a 19-item self-report assessment that measures seven components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, &amp; Kupfer, 1989). Component scores range from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty) and are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. A meta-analysis by Mollayeva et al. (2016) evaluated the measurement properties of the PSQI. This meta-analysis (N=37) demonstrated that the PSQI has good internal consistency based on Cronbach's alpha, strong reliability and validity, and moderate structural validity in a variety of samples. The PSQI has been used as an outcome measure to test the effectiveness</description>

    <measure>Self Efficacy for Performing Energy Conservation Strategies Assessment (SEPECSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline self-efficacy to six weeks later, at post-test, and after a three-month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-efficacy will be measured by the Self Efficacy for Performing Energy Conservation Strategies Assessment (SEPECSA) (Liepold &amp; Mathiowetz, 2005). The SEPECSA was developed based on the Managing Fatigue Program (Liepold &amp; Mathiowetz, 2005) and measures the individual's self-confidence to perform the strategies they learned in the program. The item response scale of the SEPECSA ranges from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (completely confident). The final score is mean of the item scores. In a study of individuals with MS (N=36), Liepold &amp; Mathiowetz (2005) demonstrated that the SEPECSA has high test and retest reliability (r = .776, ICC = .771), good validity, and very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .953). The SPECSA has not been used with the PD population, however, it has been used in previous similar studies (Ghahari et al., 2010; Matuska, Mathiowetz, &amp; Finlayson, 2007).</description>

    <description>The Individual Managing Fatigue Program includes six weekly sessions that focus on sleep, communication and body mechanics, activity stations, priorities and standards, and balancing daily schedule. Each session includes three parts: 1) a pre-session activity 2) in-session activities/information and 3) homework. Prior to coming to each session, participants will be asked to complete activities that will help them prepare for the in-session discussions. During each session participants will discuss and practice the topics most important to them. Based on their discussions, participants and therapists will decide on activities to complete during each session and as homework. The therapist will help the participant begin the homework at the end of each session, and the participant will finish it outside of the session at home. At the beginning of the following session, the therapist and participant will review the homework.</description>
