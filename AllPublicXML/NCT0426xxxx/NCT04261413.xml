  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study designed as a multicenter, open label, two-step study to determine the optimum
      dose, pharmacokinetics, and the safety of RS-0139 in patients with a recurrent, locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The research is planned as a
      two-step study (Phase Ia and phase Ib) and accelerated titration design (ATD) is used.
