  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to see if the standard of care subcutaneous injection of bortezomib can safely
      be administered at home by the patient or caregiver. All tests and assessments are based on
      standard of care procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy for malignancies is predominantly prescribed and delivered in a tertiary
      hospital and/or cancer centre setting. However, with modern chemotherapy, with a reduced side
      effect profile, this paradigm should be challenged. Indeed, the use of methotrexate and other
      biologics (a form of chemotherapy) in the Rheumatologic setting is commonly delivered
      effectively and safely in the community.

      Taken together, a hospital-based model of chemotherapy delivery may not be warranted in all
      circumstances. Moreover, the use of this current model invariably discounts the time
      commitments, needs of patients and caregivers, as well as while not addressing the emerging
      concerns regarding system capacity, efficiency and effectiveness of safe chemotherapy
      delivery.
