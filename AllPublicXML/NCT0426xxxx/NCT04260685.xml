  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-operative blood loss is an important attribution and predictor of the lumbar spine
      surgery and patient outcome. Stripping the muscle off bone makes more exposed bleeding spine
      surface is one of causes for blood loss during lumbar surgeries. The importance to decrease
      the bleeding is to improve the surgical field visibility which provides technical ease for
      surgeon and decreases the surgical time besides maintaining the hemodynamic stability. In
      past, there were many trials to minimize surgical blood loss by different drugs such as Na
      Nitroprusside, magnesium sulfate, volatile anesthetics and beta-adrenergic antagonist.

      Sample size:

      Assuming mean and standard deviation of mean arterial pressure in lidocaine group versus
      esmolol group is 90±27.9 versus 73± 22.5 so the sample size will be 70 (35 in each group )
      using Open Epi program with confidence level 95%, power of test 80% All patients will be
      hospitalized and visited a day before the surgery, full history with physical examination and
      routine investigation will be done, the nature and complications of the study will be
      explained in detail to the patient and informed written consent will be obtained from every
      participant.

      All patients will be kept nil orally 6 hours before the operation. All surgeries will be done
      by the same surgeon to decrease observer's bias. The surgeon and the outcome assessor
      (anesthesiologist collect the data) will be blinded to study drugs.

      Using computer generated randomization table, each group consists of 35 patients.

    <description>using the surgical field rating (SFR) scale of six points proposed by (Fromme et al 1986) :
Grade 0: No bleeding - virtually bloodless field. Grade 1: Slight bleeding so no suctioning required. Grade 2: Slight bleeding so occasional suctioning required. Grade 3: Low bleeding- frequent suctioning required; bleeding threatens surgical field some seconds after suction is removed.
Grade 4: Moderate bleeding- frequent suctioning required, bleeding threatens surgical field directly after suctioning.
Grade 5: Sever bleeding so constant suctioning required; bleeding appears faster than can be removed by suction; surgical field severely threatened and surgery hardly possible.</description>
