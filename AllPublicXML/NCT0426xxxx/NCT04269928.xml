  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the main cause of secondary hypertension, affecting 5-15% of
      the general hypertensive population. Early diagnosis and treatment are of crucial importance
      as patients with PA are more susceptible to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and
      mortality than blood-pressure-matched hypertensive patients.

      Current guidelines indicate that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists and laparoscopic
      adrenalectomy are the principal treatments for PA.Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended
      for patients with aldosteronoma or unilateral adrenal hyperplasia. During the past two
      decades, catheter-based arterial embolization or computed tomography (CT)-guided
      radiofrequency thermogenesis have been used for aldosteronomas treatment. Although these
      procedures are claimed to be effective for treatment of aldosteronomas, the evidence comes
      mostly from case reports or small series. In addition, some PA patients refuse surgery and
      are intolerant of the adverse effects of MR antagonists; others have persistence of PA after
      adrenelectomy, but respond poorly to MR antagonists. An alternative therapy is needed in such
      cases.

      In recent years, adrenal artery ablation has also been used to treat primary aldosteronism,
      which can reduce the level of aldosterone and blood pressure, but its efficacy and safety are
      not clear. To confirm the effect of adrenal artery ablation on blood pressure, RAAS system
      and blood potassium, the researchers conducted a parallel control clinical study of patients
      with primary aldosteronism (Aldosteronoma).
