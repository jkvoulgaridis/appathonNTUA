      Placental borders and mapping by ultrasonography and Doppler ultrasonography (placental
      mapping) preop. And verified intraoperatively . bladder peritoneal dissection till the level
      of internal Os Uterus is incised away from the placenta

        -  Baby was delivered , the uterus is exteriorised and 4-5 towel clips are applied rapidly
           control uterine incision site bleeding . Twenty units of diluted oxytocin and 100 to 200
           cc, 37Â°C of heated saline were infused from here, and then the cord was clamped . Then
           we proceed to systemically devascularize the uterus with the placenta in site After
           control of both superior vesical vessels Finding a fresh noninvaded plan between
           isthmocervical junction and posterior bladder wall aided by filling the bladder 150 cc
           saline Then cervical stump control sutures and severing the specimen above the clamps

      Now the placenta is only attached to the bladder , apply intestinal clamp or foley cath on
      the bladder below the level of invasion if feasible to reduce bleeding

        -  cut through the placenta, heavy back flow bleeding of old blood stored in the placenta
           will be noticed , but there is no hemodynamic change since the cervical stump is already
           severed

           , dissect the bladder with a large safety margin cutting through the placenta.. Then in
           cases with hematuria saline irrigation of the bladder is usually enough to clear the
           hematuria 15 out of 20 In cases with larger blood clots in the bladder cystoscope is
           done avoiding the need for cystotomy

        -  lastly removal of excessive placental tissues from the bladder wall by gentle swabbing
           or trimming, then individual control of bleeders and plication of the invaded area with
           seromuscular purse string sutures around said area , in cases of large areas , bladder
           mobilization is imperative to increase bladder capacity
