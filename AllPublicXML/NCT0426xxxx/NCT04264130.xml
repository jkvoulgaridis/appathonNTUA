  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open labelled, non randomized study to evaluate the effects of Artemisinin based Combined
      Therapies(ACTs) on schistosomiasis since Praziquantel (PZQ) which is presently the drug of
      choice for treating Schistosomiasis (STS), is ineffective on immature stages and there is
      known parasite resistance. ACTs when combined with PZQ, targeting different stages of the
      life cycle has shown some effectivity.

      Study population included all subjects in study area who signed a written Informed Consent
      Form diagnosed with Malaria- STS co-infection. Those excluded were treated with PZQ prior 6
      weeks, have drug intolerance or pregnant. At Inclusion, Basic Demographic data was recorded
      and urine samples analysed. During the follow up visits, urine samples were collected on D28
      and D42 (6 weeks post treatment). Post treatment assessment was done on urine samples
      collected on at least two consecutive days and at the end of follow up, all subjects were
      treated with a single dose pf PZQ (40 mg/kg) as recommended by WHO.
