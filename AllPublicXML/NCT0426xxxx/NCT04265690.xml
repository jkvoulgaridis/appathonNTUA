  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving nutrition during pregnancy is critical for maternal and child health, but even more
      so among pregnant adolescents. Several studies have shown that poor nutrition and diet
      quality during pregnancy is related to adverse health outcomes among both the mother and the
      infant. During pregnancy, the fetus's nutrition and diet quality is largely dependent on the
      mother. A teenage mother is in a vulnerable position because she needs to meet the demands of
      her own growth and development in addition to the growth and development of her baby, which
      can be extremely challenging, especially for mothers who are from disadvantaged communities.
      Surprisingly, given their unique needs, there is limited literature on multicomponent
      behavioral interventions that adequately address the unique nutritional needs of pregnant
      adolescent women and their fetuses, which is why interventions targeted at promoting healthy
      behaviors among low-income, racially diverse pregnant teens should be a public health
      priority, particularly in the U.S. This study aims to assess whether a multicomponent
      behavioral intervention improves intention, initiation, and sustained healthy eating
      behaviors and eating competence among Pregnant adolescents (second trimester) and Postpartum
      adolescent mothers (&lt;6 months).

    <intervention_model_description>For this proof of concept/pilot trial, we will assess the feasibility and impact of this multi-component nutrition program on improving healthy eating behaviors and eating competence. However, because we are proposing a proof of concept pilot and feasibility study, in our experience and that of others, our proposed sample size generally provides sufficient data to estimate subject retention, distribution of variables and feasibility as we plan for a larger-multi-site RCT of the proposed study. We expect our intervention to demonstrate the feasibility of the intervention in a clinic setting.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in eating competence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Eating competence will be measured using the ecSatter Inventory (EcSI 2.0) which assesses: eating attitudes, food acceptance, food regulation, and contextual skills. The 16 item EcSI 2.0 questionnaire uses a 5-point likert scale with scores from 3 to 0 [Always=3; Often =2; Sometimes=1, Rarely=0; Never=0]. Total EcSI 2.0 scores range from 0 to 48. Higher EcSI 2.0 scores are correlated with better eating competence. Eating competence cutoff is 32 and above.</description>

    <measure>Change in nutrition knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess nutrition knowledge based on the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ). The scale assesses: dietary recommendations, food groups, healthy food choices, and diet, disease, and weight associations. The GNKQ questionnaire is 88 items. The highest total GNKQ score is 88 and the lowest is 0. Higher GNKQ scores are correlated with better nutrition knowledge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cooking class acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability of the cooking classes will be assessed by a short survey with 4 questions and a 5-point likert scale that was made by the investigator. The survey will ask about their opinions about the cooking classes' nutrition information delivery.</description>
