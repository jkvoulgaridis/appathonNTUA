  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to learn about the safety of drug BAY1817080 at different
      doses and the resulting blood levels of the study drug in Japanese healthy adult male
      participants. Study drug BAY1817080 is a drug under development with a goal to suppress pain
      and chronic cough. It works by binding to and blocking proteins expressed on the sensory
      nerves of the womb tissue, bladder or airway which are oversensitive in the patients with
      endometriosis (a condition where the tissue that usually grows inside the womb grows outside
      of the womb), overactive bladder (a condition that causes a sudden urge to urinate often or
      more frequently) and long-standing cough with or without clear causes.

      Participants in this study will receive either the study drug or placebo tablets (a placebo
      looks like the test drug but does not have any medicine in it). The dosage will be either one
      single dose of study drug/placebo received on only one day or multiple doses of study
      drug/placebo received twice daily for 13 days plus one dose in the morning of the 14th day.
      The total study duration for each participant will be usually no more than 42 days. Blood
      samples will be collected from the participants to monitor the safety and measure the blood
      level of the study drug.

             by the investigator to be of clinical relevance

          -  Relevant diseases potentially interfering with the study objectives within the 4 weeks
             before screening or between screening and randomization

          -  Any febrile illness within the four weeks before screening or between screening and
             randomization

          -  Any known presence or history of severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or
             multiple drug allergies
