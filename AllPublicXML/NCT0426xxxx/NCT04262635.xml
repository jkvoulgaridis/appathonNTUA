  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized study to be conducted in Chinese patients with
      RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC. Patients who have already completed 9 cycles of standard
      first-line induction treatment, without discontinuation for toxicity, of cetuximab or
      fluorouracil or oxaliplatin,, and achieved disease control (including CR/PR and SD), and are
      progression free at the end of Cycle 9 will be assigned to 2 maintenance treatment groups by
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive cetuximab + capecitabine (Arm A) or cetuximab alone
      (Arm B). The randomization will be stratified by induction treatment response (complete
      response [CR]+ partial response [PR] versus stable disease [SD]) and primary tumor location
      (left side only versus right side). All patients from Arm A and Arm B will be treated until
      progressive disease, death from any cause, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent
      withdrawal (whichever occurs earlier).

             colon or rectum, excluding appendix carcinoma or anal canal carcinoma, with RAS and
             BRAF wild-type mutation status.

          4. Patients who received only FOLFOX plus cetuximab as first-line induction treatment
             after diagnosis of mCRC.

          5. Having completed FOLFOX plus cetuximab for 9 cycles as induction treatment without
             discontinuation for toxicity, of cetuximab or fluorouracil or oxaliplatin and achieved
             disease control (including CR/PR and SD) and are progression free at the start of
             maintenance therapy.

          6. At least one measurable metastatic lesion(s) as defined by RECIST version 1.1,
             considered unresectable at start of maintenance therapy. Patients who achieved CR and
             had no measurable lesion after induction treatment can be enrolled in this study.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

          8. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks in the opinion of the investigator.

          9. Laboratory requirements

               -  Neutrophils ≥1.5×109/L, platelets ≥75×109/L, and hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL;

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate aminotransferase
                  (AST)/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and/or alanine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. mCRC patients with completely resectable lesions after conversion chemotherapy are
             excluded. In case of liver metastases, the concept of resectability must consider both
             the R0 resection (tumor radicality as a goal) and remaining liver function;

             for more than 5 years or carcinoma-in-situ deemed cured by adequate treatment;

          4. Known brain metastasis or leptomeningeal metastasis. Patients with neurological
             symptoms should undergo brain computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) to exclude metastases;

          5. Unresolved toxicity greater than or equal to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) Grade 2 attributed to any prior therapies (excluding anemia, alopecia,

             drug administration

               -  Major surgery within 4 weeks (excluding diagnostic biopsy, the surgical incision
                  should be fully healed prior to study drug administration);

               -  Radiotherapy within 4 weeks;

               -  Anti-cancer therapy other than protocol-specified induction therapy or
                  participation in other clinical studies within 4 weeks;
