  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 able-bodied individuals will participate in one testing session to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the A-FES system. Up to 20 individuals with SCI will participate in 12
      sessions of A-FES therapy. At each session, participants will stand on a force plate (Accu
      Sway, AMTI, USA) with the A-FES system (Compex Motion II, Compex Motion, Switzerland) donned.
      The centre of pressure (COP) will be calculated in real time using the force plate data. The
      calculated COP will be presented to participants on a monitor and they will be instructed to
      shift their COP in the indicated directions as represented by a cursor (i.e. training with
      visual feedback). The intensity of electrical stimulation provided by the A-FES system will
      be regulated by the measured COP in a closed-loop manner. In this study we propose to develop
      and evaluate the clinically-feasible A-FES system for the training of standing balance.

    <intervention_name>Functional Electrical Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The device used was a prototype closed-loop FES system to improve standing balance by activating the ankle plantar flexors and dorsiflexors (i.e. A-FES system). As a closed-loop system, the body's position and velocity are continually monitored, and the level of stimulation adjusted accordingly on a moment-to-moment basis. This differs from currently available FES units, which do not monitor body movement and therefore, provide a constant level of stimulation unless manually adjusted by the user/PT. The control strategy used in the A-FES system mimics the physiological control system in able-bodied people, meaning it has the potential to &quot;re-educate&quot; normal movement patterns.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A traumatic or non-traumatic, non-progressive (AIS) C or D SCI;

          2. â‰¥18 years old;

          3. Able to stand independently for 60s;

          4. Moderate level of trunk control as evidenced by the ability to reach forward &gt;2 inches
             in standing (i.e. score of 2 on the BBS Reaching Forward task50,51); and

          5. Free of any other condition besides SCI that significantly affects walking or balance
             (e.g., no vestibular disorder, significant vision loss, stroke).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe spasticity in the legs;

          2. Contractures in the lower extremities that prevent achieving a neutral hip and ankle
             position, or extended knee;

          3. A prior lower extremity fragility fracture;

          4. An injection of botulinum toxin to leg muscles in the past six months;

          5. Peripheral nerve damage in the legs (i.e. leg muscles unresponsive to electrical
             stimulation);

          6. A pressure sore (&gt;grade 2) on the pelvis or trunk where the safety harness is applied;
             o

          7. Contraindications for FES52 (i.e. implanted electronic device, active cancer or
             radiation in past 6 months, epilepsy, skin rash/wound at a potential electrode site).

        Participants will be withdrawn from the study if FES irritates their skin.
