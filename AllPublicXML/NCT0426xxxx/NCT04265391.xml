  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was randomized controlled trial study whose subjects were pregnant women in Sleman
      District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The aims of this study were to make snakehead fish cookies
      formula which can be well accepted by pregnant women and to observed its effect on fetal
      growth and birth weight and length. It was hypothesized that snakehead fish cookies could
      prevent intrauterine fetal growth (IUGR) and low birth weight (LBW).

      Subjects on this study were randomly allocated into two groups which were treatment and
      control group. Subjects in treatment group were given snakehead fish cookies, while subject
      in control group received standard cookies. The intervention period lasted until subjects
      delivered their babies.

      Subjects were enrolled from Public Health Center (puskesmas) in Sleman District, Yogyakarta
      Province, Indonesia. Subjects were being explained about the study intervention and were
      given informed consent as an approval of joining this study. The intervention was given
      everyday as much as 75g cookies for several weeks period (until delivery). Examination on
      fetal growth was done every month for each subjects. Birth weight and length were collected
      after delivery from child health book record.
