  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the western world
      (National Cancer Institute, 2011). Prostate cancer diagnosis relates to significant
      psychological distress (Roesch et al, 2005; Hervouet et al, 2005). The management options
      available for men with localized prostate cancer typically offer similar survival rate and
      one treatment has not been determined more effective than other. Variance in severity,
      duration and frequency of side effects between treatments is considerable (National Cancer
      Institute, 2011). This can make the choice between management options challenging and
      distressing. Researches show that patients that are actively involved and provided with
      sufficient information have better health outcomes (Stewart, 1995).

      The study involves implementing interactive, web-based decision-aid to assist men with
      localized prostate cancer with their decision regarding their prostate cancer management
      options. Participants will be randomized to standard-care (SC) and SC + interactive
      decision-aid (IDA). The SC group will meet with their urologist and receive and information
      brochure. In addition the IDA group will receive a website that includes a wealth of
      information (e.g., overview about prostate cancer, overview of different treatment options,
      pros and cons of different treatment options and a value clarification exercise that is
      designed to assist participants to weigh the risks and benefits of each prostate cancer
      management option).

      The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated with questionnaires administered
      prior to randomization (baseline) and then again two weeks, one, three and six months after
      the randomization.

      Aim 1. Evaluate the relative impact of SC versus SC + IDA on medical decision making. It is
      hypothesized that participants randomized to the SC + IDA arms will have improved decision
      making (e.g., reduced decisional conflict) and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., distress),
      compared to those randomized to SC only.

      Aim 2. Identify mechanisms by which the interventions impact patient outcomes. It is
      hypothesized that: 1) improved decision making and psychosocial outcomes for the IDA arms
      will be mediated by increased knowledge; 2) participants who are undecided about the
      treatment decision and those that have information-seeking decision styles will benefit most
      from the decision-aid interventions.

It is also a good screening tool for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. Response options range from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;several days&quot; on a 4-point Likert scale. GAD-7 total score ranges from 0 to 21, were higher score indicates more severe anxiety. It has excellent internal consistency (α = 0.92).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely used and well validated measure used to screen for depression and assess severity of it. It is a 9-item scale and answers are on 4-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;nearly every day&quot;. PHQ-9 total score ranges from 0 to 27, were higher score indicates more severe depression. PHQ-9 has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure.</description>

    <description>The NCCN Distress Thermometer and checklist is a widely used screening measure for distress in cancer patients. It consists of a distress thermometer where participants assess their distress on a scale from 0 to 10, were 0 indicates no distress and 10 extreme distress. Additionally participants answer a problem checklist with several domains to identify what area of life distresses the participant.</description>

It is a 22-item measure that includes three factors; avoidance, hyper arousal and intrusion. Those factors together form a cancer-specific distress measure and the higher the score on the scale suggest more distress. Total score range from 0 to 88.

It measures how people with life-threatening illnesses make treatment decisions. It measures the degree of control a person wants to have when making a medical treatment management decision.The scale is a single item and displays five possible roles of patient in decision making, that is fully passive, semi-passive, collaborative, semi-active and fully active.</description>
