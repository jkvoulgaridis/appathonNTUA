  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injection of AMG0001
      (hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] plasmid) to improve ulcer healing and perfusion in patients
      with peripheral artery disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study.
      Approximately 60 male or female subjects aged 18 years or older with one shallow foot ulcer
      and mild/moderate ischemia due to peripheral artery disease (PAD) will be randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment groups:

        -  4.0 mg AMG0001 intramuscular (IM) (n = 20)

        -  8.0 mg AMG0001 IM (n = 20)

        -  Placebo IM (n = 20)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of PAD and mild/moderate foot ischemia (WIFI ischemia grades 1,
             2)

          -  A single measurable ulcer of ≥ 1 cm2 and ≤ 10 cm2 on a lower extremity without
             evidence of infection or gangrene and no evidence of bone and/or tendon involvement at
             randomization

          -  Subjects will undergo protocol-defined standardized wound care during the screening
             period and through 12 months from the first dose of investigational product

          -  Subjects who have a diagnosis of diabetes must be considered stable with no changes in
             diabetic medication regimen anticipated during the study period. Subjects who have a
             diagnosis of diabetes must have a HbA1c of ≤12% at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have excessive tissue necrosis that is unlikely to benefit from
             medication, or those subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are felt likely
             to require revascularization within 1 month of screening

          -  Subjects with severe limb ischemia

          -  Subjects who are considered likely to require a major amputation (at or above the
             ankle) within 3 months of screening

          -  Subjects with deep ulcerations with bone or tendon exposure, or uncontrolled
             infection, or with the largest ulcer that is &gt;10 cm2 in area

          -  Subjects with hemodynamically significant aorto-iliac or femoropopliteal occlusive
             disease

          -  Subjects who have had a technically successful revascularization by surgery or
             angioplasty within 2 months. If subjects are more than two months from
             revascularization and still meet the inclusion criteria, they may be considered for
             enrollment. Subjects who have had a technically unsuccessful attempt at
             revascularization may be enrolled at least one week from the procedure

          -  Subjects currently receiving immunosuppressive medication, systematically administered
             steroid therapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Inhaled and topical steroid
             therapies are allowed
