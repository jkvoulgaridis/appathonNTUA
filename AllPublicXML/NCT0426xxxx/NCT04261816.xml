  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients who underwent liver transplantation from
      January 1, 2016 to December 30, 2019 were admitted to the study and divided into two groups.
      Early extubation group: early extubation (EE) in the operating room immediately following
      liver transplantation. Delay extubation: delay extubation (DE) in the intensive care unit
      following liver transplantation. The primary objectives were to compare the incidence of
      moderate to severe postoperative complications between the EE and DE groups. The secondary
      objectives were to compare outcomes such as intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay,
      hospital length of stay, and total cost between the EE and DE groups.

      Patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 1, 2016 to December 30, 2019 were
      admitted to the study. Inclusion criteria: (1) adult patients (age ≥ 18 years), (2)
      undergoing liver transplantation, (3) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Exclusion
      criteria were the following: (1) Re-transplantation; (2) Multiorgan transplants; (3)
      Intraoperative deaths ;(4) Leaving hospital within 48 hours; (5)Incomplete clinical data. The
      primary objectives was the number of patients in-hospital moderate to severe postoperative
      complications. Complications were defined and graded as mild, moderate, or severe as
      described by European Perioperative Clinical Outcome definitions and were included if they
      occurred in hospital after surgery. The secondary objectives were 30 Days all-cause
      mortality, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, total hospital cost, the incidence of
      re-admissions, re-intubation and reoperations.
