  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of autologous Lung Spheroid Stem Cells (LSCs)
      administered by intravenous infusion in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      Participants:

      Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

      Procedures (methods):

      24 patients previously diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated at baseline. LSCs will be grown from
      autologous trans-bronchial pulmonary biopsy specimens. The first group, consisting of 6
      patients will be randomized after completion of the screening procedures to either a
      treatment group of 100 million LSCs administered via intravenous infusion or to a control
      group (standard care) in a 2:1 LSC to control group ratio. The second group of 18 patients
      will be randomized after completion of the screening procedures to either a treatment group
      of 200 million LSCs administered via intravenous infusion or to a control group (standard
      care) in a 2:1 LSC to control group ratio. Patients will be randomized using permuted blocks
      in a 2:1 LSC to control group ratio, providing a distribution of 8:4:12 patients among the
      control, low dose, and high dose groups, respectively. If the patient is randomized and 100
      million LSCs are not achieved, then the patient will be analyzed separately and another
      patient enrolled. Intravenous infusion of LSCs will take place 4-8 weeks after the pulmonary
      biopsies are obtained. All patients will be followed up at months 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18,
      and 24 after infusion to complete the safety and efficacy assessments listed herein. All
      patients will receive standard of care for their IPF.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed before.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be collected for the assessment of hematology parameters. The clinical concern range for the parameters will be: hematocrit (high: &gt;0.54 proportion of red blood cells in blood); hemoglobin (high: &gt;180 grams per liter [g/L]), lymphocytes (low: &lt;0.8x10^9 cells per liter [cells/L]); neutrophil count (low: &lt;1.5x10^9 cells/L); platelet count (low: &lt;100x10^9 cells/L and high: &gt;550x10^9 cells/L); white blood cells count (low: &lt;3x10^9 cells/L and high: &gt;20x10^9 cells/L).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in High Resolution CT scan Fibrosis Score (0-50)</measure>
    <time_frame>screening visit prior to infusion and 12 months after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Each lobe of the lung will be numerically scored on findings seen with fibrosis utilizing High resolution CT Chest (HRCT). A numerical value is assigned to a specific finding related to fibrosis, with higher values assigned to more specific findings of fibrosis. A total composite overall numerical score will be obtained for the lungs, with a maximum possible pulmonary fibrosis score of 50 (Right upper lobe, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe). An azygous lobe if present will be considered as part of the right upper lobe.</description>
