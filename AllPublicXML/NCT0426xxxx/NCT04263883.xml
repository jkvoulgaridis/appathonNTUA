  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonspecific neck pain (NSNP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal problems treated by
      orthopedic physicians and physiotherapists. NSNP has an annual incidence rate of 38 to 73%
      and a lifetime prevalence of approximately 48%, leading to both economic and social
      problems.Due to increased disability-adjusted life-years from 17 million (95% confidence
      interval (CI): 11.4-23.7) in 1990 to 29 million (95% CI: 19.5-40.5) in 2016, Chronic neck
      pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder worldwide. No specific cause for neck symptoms
      assigned for most patients so it described as non-specific chronic neck pain (NSNP)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the exact relationship between posture and NSNP is unsettled, the posture of the
      cervical spine appears to influence dorsal neck muscle activity at rest and during movement.
      Additionally, the forward head posture associated with thoracic kyphosis indirectly affects
      cervical flexion and rotational range of motion (ROM) also sustained computer work and
      prolonged using smart phones often in positions that encourage a functional kyphosis, appears
      to modify neck posture, as well as scapular positioning and upper trapezius muscle activity.
      Besides that Ergonomic intervention, including adjustments of the workplace station and
      postural correction, have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing NP with some work
      conditions. In addition, modalities that used to correct sagittal alignment of the cervical
      spine proved statistical and clinically significant results related to pain, disability, and
      improved nerve function. That is accomplish cause and effect relationship between bad posture
      and neck symptoms. According to the systematic review of Anabela et al., about head posture
      assessment useful for neck patients or not? The answer, of course, was yes, but it must be
      considered in relation to the patient's symptoms and related functional problems. Harrison
      and his colleagues reported that posture abnormalities occurred in the head, ribs, and pelvis
      in three dimensions in the form of translations and rotational displacements. Therefore, we
      should consider three dimensional (3D)postural assessment and correction during the treatment
      of NSNP associated with significant posture problems of the head in relation to thoracic.
      Growing research about using mirror image traction during ambulatory exercise, which is
      prescribed specifically to help normalize the patient's neuromuscular dysfunction and
      postural deformation via reflecting the patient's posture across different planes, is more
      beneficial than a less personalized program. With these considerations in mind and to combine
      the findings of 3D postural assessment into the treatment program, we designed adjustable 3D
      posture corrective orthotic (PCO) to be worn by the patient for a short time. The device has
      the ability to reflect all transitional displacements and rotational movements of the head
      then ask the patient to make ambulatory exercise using a treadmill while the PCO holds the
      patient's reverse posture. To our knowledge, no randomized clinical trial (RCT) had evaluated
      the addition of a 3D adjustable PCO to usual care program and investigate its short- and
      moderate-term improvement effects on NSNP management outcomes (i.e., neck pain, neck
      disability and 3-dimensional posture parameters of the head). The primary aim of our study
      was to evaluate of conducting an RCT using neck disability index (NDI )and 3D posture
      parameters. The secondary aim was NPRS and Active CervicalROM. investigate the effect size of
      the addition of ambulatory mirror-image traction via the wearing of 3D adjustable PCO
      compared to control group interventions for neck pain, disability, and 3D posture parameters.

    <description>The NDI is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping, and recreation. The NDI has sufficient support and usefulness to retain its current status as the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain The NDI can be scored as a raw score [2]or doubled and expressed as a percent [3]. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage.0 points or 0% means no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation.</description>

A magnetic yoke consisting of 2 bar magnets held anteriorly and posteriorly was provided to reduce the influence of thoracic rotation. The CROM has demonstrated good concurrent validity for active ROM. According to the systematic review by Chen et al, the mean normative values of cervical ROM were determined to be: 52 degrees for flexion, 71 degrees for the extension, 72degrees for rotation, and 43 degrees for lateral flexion. Documentation of cervical ROM was rendered in the form of the full range (ie, a total value for the sagittal, frontal, or transverse plane, yielding 3 measurements).</description>

    <description>ambulatory mirror image Traction through wearing 3D adjustable Posture Corrective Orthotic (PCO), This way of functional training will deliver via the use of the adjustable cervicothoracic orthosis during the patient walking at approximately 2-3 miles per hour on a standard, motorized treadmill. The brace will reverse the abnormal posture according to the 3D posture analysis data. To facilitate tissue remodeling by reverse posture training, this called mirror image traction.then the ambulatory exercises by using treadmill will be performed while the patient's mirror image posture will be held by the adjustable orthosis, ambulatory exercises for 20 minutes by using treadmill based on Harrison et al., approach, this program will be repeated 2-3 times /week for 10weeks.</description>
