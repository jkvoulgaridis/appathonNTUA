  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different protocols in controlling dentin
      hypersensitivity in patients with teeth affected by MIH. The subjects will be randomly
      designated in four experimental groups, according to different treatments. Pain will be
      assessed with the visual analog scale (Visual Analogue Scale - VAS), after stimulation with
      air from the triple syringe and and an exploratory probe at the time of (initial)
      recruitment, immediately after treatment, after 1 week and 1 month, 3 and 6 months after
      treatment.

    <description>Two weeks before the start of the study, the volunteers will go through a wash out period, where they should only use oral care products donated by the researchers, which should be used until the end of the study. The oral hygiene kit will contain 1 toothbrush (Professional Lab Series, Colgate Palmolive), 1 toothpaste without desensitizing agent, but with fluorine (Elmex) and 1 dental floss (Colgate). Afterwards, this group will receive no treatment. Instead of the sealant, water will be used and the laser will remain with power 0W, that is, there will be no light emission, giving the group the characteristic of the control group, no treatment.</description>

    <description>In this group, besides the instructions described in the control group, the teeth that will be sealed will be isolated. 35% phosphoric acid will be applied for 20 seconds and then it will be necessary to wash and dry the tooth surface. Apply a thin layer of PermaSeal (sealant) for 5 seconds to the tooth surface and light curing for 20 seconds.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Low Level Laser Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this group, besides the instructions described in the control group, volunteers will receive irradiation with AsGaAl laser, wavelength of 780 nm (Laser XT Therapy, DMC, São Carlos, SP) with fixed power of 100mW, energy density of 35 J/cm2 (considering a spot size of 0.028 cm2 of this equipment), the dose will be 1 J per point. The irradiation will be performed at a cervical, an apical point and another point exactly on the injury, totaling a dose of 3J. Treatment should be performed in 3 sessions with an ideal 72-hour interval between them.</description>

    <description>Permaseal (Ultradent) is an unloaded resin based on methacrylate and photopolymerizable. The teeth that will be sealed will be isolated. 35% phosphoric acid will be applied for 20 seconds and then it will be necessary to wash and dry the tooth surface. Apply a thin layer of PermaSeal for 5 seconds to the tooth surface and light curing for 20 seconds. After that, it is necessary to evaluate occlusion.</description>
