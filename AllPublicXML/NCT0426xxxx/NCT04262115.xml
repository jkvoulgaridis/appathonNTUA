    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of
      randomizing adults with overweight and obesity to an exercise intervention of either
      prescribed morning aerobic exercise (AM-EX) or prescribed evening aerobic exercise (PM-EX)
      progressing to 2000 kcal/wk.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of
      randomizing adults with overweight and obesity to an exercise intervention of either
      prescribed morning aerobic exercise (AM-EX) or prescribed evening aerobic exercise (PM-EX)
      progressing to 2000 kcal/wk. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to assess
      recruitment, retention, and adherence to the exercise interventions, and to estimate
      treatment effects.

             physical activity programs or clinical trials.

          -  Weight loss &gt;5% in past 3 months for any reason except post-partum weight loss, weight
             gain &gt;% in past 3 months requires assessment by PI to determine reason for weight gain
             and if it is appropriate for the subject to participate in the study.

          -  Weight loss of &gt;50 lbs in past 3 years for any reason except post-partum weight loss.
