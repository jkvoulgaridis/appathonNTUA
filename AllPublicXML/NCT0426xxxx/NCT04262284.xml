  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Respreeza® Summary of Product Characteristics, the initial infusions must be
      administered under the supervision of a health professional experienced in the treatment of
      alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, although subsequent infusions may be administered at home by
      the person responsible for care or by the patient.

      Clinical data on self-administration of Respreeza® are however limited and the grounds for
      self-administration are left to the assessment of the attending physician, who needs to
      ensure that appropriate training is delivered.

      In this context, CSL Behring would like to run a clinical study in order to assess the
      effectiveness of a home self-administration learning program in terms of switching to
      self-administration, and the long term maintenance of this administration.
