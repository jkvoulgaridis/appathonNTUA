  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with gender dysphoria present the difficulties of access to health care. Little time
      is devoted to education of health professionals about the care of transgender persons.
      According to the proposal of the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health there is a need
      to increase knowledge in this area and to improve the care of transgender people including
      prevention and screening.

      Similarly, little is known about social and medical needs of the transgender population.

      This project proposes to illustrate gender dysphoria through testimonies of transgender
      people with the aim to increase the investigator's understanding aout the needs and the
      desires of this population and to describe the process of medical and social transition.
