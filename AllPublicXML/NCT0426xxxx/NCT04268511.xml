  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The regional anesthesia methods of caudal epidural block (CEB) and dorsal penile nerve block
      (DPNB) play an important role in providing postoperative pain control in pediatric
      circumcision surgery. However, the short-term postoperative analgesic effect and the risk of
      block failure limit the use of DPNB, a peripheral nerve block.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CEB is a neuraxial block and commonly used to control moderate and severe postoperative pain
      following surgery related to the lumbosacral and midthoracic dermatomes. CEB can have serious
      undesirable complications such as intravascular and subarachnoid injection, urinary retention
      and motor block. Pudendal nerve block can be used as an alternative to both DPNB and CEB for
      penile surgery such as circumcision. The pudendal nerve is a peripheral nerve combining the
      anterior rami of the sacral plexus nerves (S2-S4) and provides motor and sensory innervation
      to the perineal region.

    <description>It was assessed five times after the operation with Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale. The lowest scale score is 4 points and the highest 13 points. Significant pain behavior for Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale has been identified as 7 points or more. Following transfer from the recovery unit to the ward, the 30 minutes, 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 12th hour pain levels were evaluated by the ward nurse.</description>

    <description>Linear ultrasound probe and the sacral hiatus at the sacral cornu level was visualized using an out-of-plane transverse view at 5-10 megahertz . The linear probe was then rotated 90 degrees and placed longitudinally in the midline to evaluate the sacral cornus, sacrococcygeal ligament and sacral bone.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Pudendal nerve block group</arm_group_label>
    <description>The long axis of the ultrasound probe was positioned on a horizontal line connecting the ischial tuberosity that had been previously located by palpation to the anus. The ischial tuberosity could be easily identified as a hypoechoic area that is bounded superiorly by a hyperechoic line. The probe was then moved medially on the same axis until the rectum appeared as another hypoechoic area.</description>

    <description>A 22 Gauge 50 mm insulated needle was then introduced in the anterior-posterior direction at the middle of the ultrasound probe's superior edge with an out-of-plane approach and using an inclination of 15° in the sagittal plane. The needle tip's position was identified by direct visualization using the movement of adjacent anatomical structures.</description>
