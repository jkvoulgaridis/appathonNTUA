  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study prospectively included 150 breast cancer patients (30 patients in the first stage
      and 120 patients in the second stage) who were treated with the commonly used neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy recommended by NCCN, received surgical treatment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
      and evaluated the efficacy according to the surgical pathological response.Based on the
      technical analysis of Mammaprint in patients with pathologic complete response (pCR), partial
      response and no response, we analyzed the characteristic genes related to breast cancer in
      tumor tissues and evaluated the accuracy and sensitivity of Mammaprint test in the efficacy
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.A new model for predicting NCT effect of breast cancer with
      combined risk genes and clinical parameters was established based on the clinical
      characteristic parameters of patients to study the accuracy and sensitivity of Mammaprint
      monitoring for prognosis determination of breast cancer patients.
