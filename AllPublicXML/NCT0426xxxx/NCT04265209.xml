  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical study to demonstrate an at least equivalent performance of a new PET molecular
      Imaging radiopharmaceutical named [18F] LBT-999 in brain imaging compared to the SPECT
      reference method named [123I]-FP-CIT to establish the differential diagnosis between
      Parkinson's Disease and Essential Tremor.
