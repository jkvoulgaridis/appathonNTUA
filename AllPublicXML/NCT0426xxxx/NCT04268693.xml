  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational pilot study urine samples will be collected from women receiving
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin for triple negative breast cancer to determine
      whether: 1) exposures bisphenol and phthalate levels change over the course of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, and 2) levels differ between black women and those of other racial groups.

      The hypothesis is that bisphenol and phthalate levels will be similar to those of the general
      US female population at the time of diagnosis, however levels will increase during treatment
      due to exposure to plastics in the medical setting. The investigators also hypothesize that
      because of differences in personal care product use, black women may have higher urinary
      levels of bisphenols and phthalates prior to starting chemotherapy.

      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that does not
      express estrogen, progesterone, or the human epidermal growth factor (HER2/neu) receptors,
      and has a low overall survival rate compared to other types of breast cancer.

      Unlike hormone and HER2/neu positive breast cancers, targeted therapies are not available for
      TNBC. Thus, the systemic chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment
      of TNBC. However, doxorubicin resistance is common, and leads to poorer treatment outcomes.

      Understanding factors that contribute to doxorubicin resistance is critical to improving
      cancer treatment outcomes among women with TNBC. Pre-clinical in vitro studies indicate that
      exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, contribute to
      doxorubicin resistance, but these findings have not been evaluated in humans.
