  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative evaluation of cavernous sinus invasion by pituitary adenoma is critical for
      performing safe operation and deciding on surgical extent as well as for treatment success.
      Because of the small size of the pituitary gland and sellar fossa, determining the exact
      relationship between the pituitary adenoma and cavernous sinus can be challenging. Performing
      thin slice thickness MRI may be beneficial but is inevitably associated with increased noise
      level. By applying deep learning based denoising algorithm, diagnosis of cavernous sinus
      invasion by pituitary adenoma may be improved.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing preoperative brain MR for pituitary adenoma

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have any type of bioimplant activated by mechanical, electronic, or
             magnetic means (e.g., cochlear implants, pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulates,
             electronic infusion pumps, etc), because such devices may be displaced or malfunction

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding; urine pregnancy test will be performed on
             women of child bearing potential

          -  Poor MRI image quality due to artifacts
