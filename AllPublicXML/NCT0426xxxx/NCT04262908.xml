  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of patients (15 to 45%) who have benefited from a total hip or knee
      replacement surgery (THKA), are put on sick leave (SL). This SL allows these patients who had
      a professional activity at the time of the intervention (age &lt;65 years) to enhance the
      healing, improve the quality of life and ensure a functional return to work. The number of
      patients returning to work and the time taken to return to work after the intervention are d
      depending on the intervention (hip or knee) and are linked to socio-demographic factors, to
      the patient's general condition (comorbidity, presence of other arthritis joints…) and the
      type of professional activity.

      Studies evaluating the impact of the type of professional activity on the return to work
      after THKA are nonexistent in France, rare in the literature, mostly retrospective and
      methodologically weak. In addition, the individual and socioeconomic impact of the cessation
      of work after an THKA, the absence of national data assessing the predictive nature of
      socio-professional categories on the return to work using a multivariate analysis motivated
      us to set up this study.

      The data usually collected in the medical file will be collected as part of the preoperative
      and 3 months postoperative study. As part of this study, a phone call will be made to contact
      patients who have had a prolonged SL

      The data collected are as follows:

      During hospitalization Socio-demographic data: sex, age, title of the profession, the joint
      concerned, family situation, place of life, postoperative availability of a caregiver or home
      help if necessary.

      Clinical data: Comorbidities, weight, height, date of the arthroplasty, per and or
      postoperative complications of the arthroplasty, date of prescribed work stoppage

      3 months postoperative: medical consultation Date of the 3-month consultation, date and
      method of resumption of work, if applicable, otherwise the duration of the extension of the
      duration of the SL, the doctor prescribing the extension and the causal link of this
      extension to the arthroplasty

      4 months postoperative: telephone call This phone call will relate to patients whose work
      stoppage has been extended. Will be collected, the date and the mode of resumption of work,
      if not the cause of not resumed.

      For patients whose prolongation of SL has been prescribed by the attending physician, the
      doctor of the rehabilitation center (knee prostheses) or by the occupational physician, the
      latter will be contacted by telephone to collect the reason for prolongation of the TA.
