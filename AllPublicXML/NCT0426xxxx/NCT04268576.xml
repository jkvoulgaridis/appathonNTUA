  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an observational study, prospective in order to assess the impact of the implementation
      of an early rehabilitation program on post-operative recovery. this is measured by the qOR15
      questionnaire in patients operated on for a programmed hysterectomy, it takes place in the
      gynecology department of the CHR Metz-Thionville hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program implemented will comply with HAS recommendations. The only change in management
      for patients participating in the study is the completion of the self-questionnaire QOR-15 on
      D-1 (the day before the operation), D0 (the day of the operation) and D1 (the day after the
      operation).

      It is planned to include 74 patients before the implementation of the early rehabilitation
      protocol and 74 patients after the implementation of the early rehabilitation protocol. The
      total duration of inclusion is established at 18 months.

      The measures applied should improve the patient's well-being and accelerate his return to
      normal life and therefore reduce the length of his stay.

    <description>The QoR score 15 is a self-questionnaire of 15 items, each scored from 0 to 10. These items assess 5 dimensions of post-operative recovery: pain, physical comfort, functional autonomy, emotions and psychological support. These 15 items represent the quality of post-operative rehabilitation in its physical and mental dimensions.
A variation of 8 points is considered significant.</description>
