    <textblock>
      The AFFELECT -study compares two types of treatment modalities for acute atrial fibrillation
      or flutter for patients in whom rhythm control is desirable. The main purpose is to observe
      if these arrhythmias can be safely treated electively (within 5-9 days).

      All patients are recruited in the emergency department. Patients must be in good clinical
      condition so that they can be discharged regardless to which treatment modality is randomly
      selected to them. Patients randomized to conventional care are treated conventionally which
      means acute rhythm control is applied by electrical or medical cardioversion in the emergency
      department (within 48 hours of onset of the arrhythmia). Patients randomized to elective care
      are discharged immediately after adequate temporary rhythm control is assured.

      All patients will visit a cardiologist out-patient clinic at approximately one week after the
      emergency room visit. Patients randomized to elective treatment and still in atrial
      fibrillation or in atrial flutter will be restored to sinus rhythm by electrical or medical
      cardioversion at the out-patient clinic. Cardiovascular status and treatment options are
      evaluated for all patients.

      Anticoagulation is managed according existing guidelines for all patients. Due to possibility
      of delayed cardioversion in the interventional group (elective care group), all patients
      receive anticoagulation before the out-patient clinic despite their thromboembolic risk. All
      patients who have not received adequate anticoagulation for three weeks prior to the delayed
      cardioversion will undergo a transesophageal cardiac ultrasound to ensure they are not in
      excess risk for thromboembolic events. Patients randomized to elective treatment have the
      possibility to opt-out and undergo acute cardioversion if their symptoms are unmanageable
      during the first week before the out-patient clinical.

      All patients are monitored for their symptoms by a standardized quality-of-life questionnaire
      and for possibly required acute medical interventions during the first week and one month
      after the out-patient clinic. After one month, all patients undergo an electrocardiography
      (ECG) to ensure the maintenance of normal rhythm in both treatment groups. After the months
      follow-up all patients are subsequently monitored for a maximum of five years for need of
      medical interventions due to atrial fibrillation of atrial flutter. New antiarrhythmics such
      as flecainide are not prescribed during the first month.

    <intervention_model_description>The AFFECT trial is a randomized clinical trial with a non-inferioirity setting studying the applicability of delayed rhythm control in the management of acute paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter.
Patients are randomized to two treatment protocols in 2:3 ratio. For every two patients randomized to conventional treatment, three patients are randomized to experimental treatment. The randomization ratio is designed to allow for maximally one third of the patients in the experimental treatment group to drop-out without compromising the power of the study.
Overall five hundred patients are required to show non-inferiority with a one-sided alpha value 0.025 and 90% power expecting a maximal drop out rate of 33% (n=100) from the experimental treatment arm.</intervention_model_description>
