  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was aimed to compare shoulder proprioception in chronic mechanical cervical pain to
      a matched normal group. This study include 2 groups, 40 subjects with mechanical chronic
      cervical pain and 40 healthy subjects representing the control group. The primary outcome
      measure was the shoulder proprioception test of both upper limbs during active repositioning
      and quantified with angular displacement error.

      cervical pain and 40 healthy subjects representing the control group. The primary outcome
      measure was the shoulder proprioception test of both upper limbs during active repositioning
      and quantified with angular displacement error. Test was applied using an isokinetic
      dynamometer device at angle 30° for both shoulder internal and external rotation on both
      sides with an angular velocity 30°/sec.

        For the control group they are normal subjects. For the group with cervical pain,
        participants had a chronic mechanical cervical pain started from three to 12 months with a
        score of 3 to 65 according to the short-form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).
