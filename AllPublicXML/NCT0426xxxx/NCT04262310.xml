      The study consists of a physical examination, standardized meals and 3 oral sugar tests with
      24 hour urine collections. It requires the participants to visit the Clinical Research Trials
      Unit in the Charlton Building and Domitilla Building. Remuneration will be offered.

    <description>Normal data on intestinal permeability in a Healthy human cohort:
To summarize, using descriptive statistics, the median, 95% confidence interval, interquartile range of the following:
Urine excretion of probe molecules at 0-2h (reflecting small bowel permeability) with primary interest in 13C-mannitol and rhamnose
Urine excretion of probe molecules at 8-24h (reflecting colonic permeability) with primary interest in lactulose and sucralose
Urine excretion of probe molecules at 2-8h reflecting both small intestinal and colonic permeability As part of the effort to ascertain conditions under which the test would be performed in the future, we shall test the intra-individual coefficient of variation in healthy individuals, when the test is performed twice under conditions of identical diet, and when the test is performed with diets that have standardized but different quantities of fiber</description>
