  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world with 1.8 million estimated incident cases
      in 2012 (12.9% of diagnosed cancers) and 1.6 million deaths annually. In mainland France,
      lung cancer represents 12% of all incident cancers. The standardized incidence rates for the
      world population were then 52.6 per 100,000 for men and 23.4 / 100,000 for women,
      respectively. In Reunion, 415 cases of primary bronchopulmonary cancers were reported for the
      years 2011-2012, which gives standardized incidence rates lower than those observed in
      mainland France (33.1 / 100,000 in humans, 8.2 / 100,000 in women).

      If the incidence of bronchopulmonary cancer is lower in Réunion than in mainland France, the
      study of histological subtypes appears different: the investigators observe a greater
      frequency of adenocarcinomas (65% vs 45%), at the expense squamous cell carcinomas. In
      addition, for adenocarcinomas, the frequency of EGFR type mutations is twice as high (23% vs
      11%). Thus, if this rate of EGFR mutations observed in mainland France is very close to those
      described in all Caucasian populations, that observed in the Reunionese population appears
      closer to those described in Asian populations, and more particularly the Indian population.
      This can perhaps be explained by the fact that the population of Reunion is a cosmopolitan
      and highly mixed race, whose share of Asian origin, mainly Indian and Chinese, is
      significant.

      In clinical practice, INCa recommends carrying out the search for the EGFR mutation for any
      patient with locally advanced or metastatic lung carcinoma, not small cell and non
      epidermoid. This restriction to the histology of adenocarcinoma is justified by the low
      frequency of EGFR mutations for other histological types in Caucasian populations. However,
      some studies describe significant EGFR mutation rates for epidermoid cancers in Asian
      populations, particularly in India. Thus, given that a large part of the Réunion population
      shares Asian origins, the question of the frequency of EGFR mutations among squamous cell
      carcinomas in Réunion is asked.

      The hypothesis of this research is that, given the ethnic characteristics of the Reunionese
      population, the proportion of bronchopulmonary epidermoid cancers carrying the EGFR mutation
      is potentially significantly higher than that observed in Caucasian populations, including
      the French metropolitan population. If this rate of EGFR mutations were high in the Reunion
      population, it would then be necessary to allow the search for this mutation to be extended
      to all bronchopulmonary cancers, which will improve their therapeutic management.
