      The aim of this prospective cohort study is to assess the adherenсe to medical therapy and
      its influence on long-term outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the outpatient
      registry

      Registry PROFILE is a patients database with cardiovascular diseases who consistently apply
      to the specialized cardiology department of the &quot;National Medical Research Center for
      Preventive Medicine&quot; for consultation or to assess their possible participation in clinical
      trials The purpose of this study is to assess adherence to medical therapy and its impact on
      long-term outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure enrolled to PROFILE registry from
      01 January 2016 to 01 July 2020. The patients who were enrolled between 01 January 2016 to 01
      December 2019 will be invited to clinical visit by phone. For patients who will join PROFILE
      registry after 01 December 2019 the first visit of this study is the day of enrollment to
      PROFILE registry.

      The first visit (V1) is an inclusion in the study. During this visit assess adherence to
      medication therapy General and to specific medications. The main factors affecting treatment
      adherence will be identified.

      The second visit (V2) is planned for each patient 1 year after the first visit (V2). During
      the second visit the adherence to the therapy and frequency of Secondary Outcome Measures
      will be estimated. Impossible to visit repeated, a telephone interview can be done

    <description>The Adherence scale of the Russian National Society of evidence based pharmacotherapy will be used to assess patients' adherence to treatment. The patients will be asked questions about taking prescribed medications as recommended by a doctor.
The score system with the min value in the scale 0 and the max value 4 is used for the assessment of the results: 0 - adherent, 1-2 - partially adherent, 3 - partially non-adherent, 4 - non adherent.</description>
