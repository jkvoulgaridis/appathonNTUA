      A Phase1/2a Study of Rigosertib plus Nivolumab in Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients with
      KRAS Mutation who Progressed on First-Line Treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase I study followed by a Phase 2a dose-expansion
      phase to study the combination of Rigosertib and Nivolumab in metastatic Kirsten rat sarcoma
      positive (KRAS+) lung adenocarcinoma patients who have progressed on standard first line
      treatment. Study patients will have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria enumerated in
      this protocol. The Phase I dose escalation plan will start with an accelerated titration
      design (ATD) using single patient cohorts until grade 2 toxicity is experienced. At that
      point, the ATD will be terminated and the dose escalation will enter a standard 3+3 design
      based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). The MTD (Phase 1 primary endpoint) is defined as the
      highest dose for which at most 1 patient out of 6 experiences a DLT.

      Rigosertib escalation will occur with three dose levels (dose D1: 280mg twice daily; dose D2:
      560mg in the morning (qAM), 280mg in the evening (qPM); dose D3: 560mg twice daily; taken by
      mouth for 21 consecutive days of the 28 day cycle), based on previous dose escalation studies
      in other malignancies, while Nivolumab dose will be fixed at the standard dose (240mg every 2
      weeks, given intravenously).

      Once the MTD is determined, an additional planned 12 patients will be enrolled in the
      expansion phase to further study toxicity and to determine preliminary efficacy endpoints
      including ORR (phase 2a primary endpoint), PFS, and OS (secondary endpoints) of the
      combination.

             the Study Calendar.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and following

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study drug. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately. A female of child-bearing potential is any
             woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or

             consecutive months).

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. If received as part of
             first line treatment, last administration of previous investigational agent must be
             greater than 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug combination.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital

          -  Tumor harbors an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitizing (activating)
             mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation. All other co-mutations
             will be allowed.

          -  Has known untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat radiological
             imaging, clinically stable, and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least
             14 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment. Patients on chronic steroids (more than 4 weeks at stable dose) equivalent
             to ≤ 10mg prednisone will not be excluded.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 1 year
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is acceptable.

             in situ cervical or anal cancer, prostate cancer on stable dose of hormonal therapy
             without rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and breast cancer whom have been
             treated with curative intent, who may be on hormonal therapy.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

          -  HIV positive with detectable viral load, or anyone not on stable anti-viral (HAART)
             regimen, or with &lt;350 cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells/microliter in the
             peripheral blood. No HIV testing is required.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study medication

          -  History of interstitial lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing
             pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immunosuppressive doses
             of glucocorticoids to assist with management. A history of radiation pneumonitis in
             the radiation field is permitted.

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.

          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either psychiatric or physical
