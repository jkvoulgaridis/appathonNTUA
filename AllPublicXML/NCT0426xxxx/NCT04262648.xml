    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-masked (blinded), post-marketing
      clinical study of a drug Lactobacillus Reuteri NCIMB 30351 drops in functional disorders of
      gastrointestinal tract and skin symptoms of food allergies in children between the ages of
      one and four months inclusive.

      The aim of the study is to assess clinical effects of probiotics Lactobacillus Reuteri NCIMB
      30351 drops on the symptoms of infantile colic, constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal
      reflux, atopic dermatitis/eczema in full-term newborns during the first months of life,
      laboratory parameters of microbiome will also be assessed.

      A prospective study comparing two treatment groups:

      Group 1 (treatment group) - 60 infants. Group 2 (control group) - 30 infants, placebo. The
      study drug will be taken in 1 time per day within 25 days. Allowed symptomatic therapy
      includes defoamers (simethicone-based preparations), carminative preparations (dill water
      (fennel)), etc.
