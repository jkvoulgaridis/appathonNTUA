  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is very common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and is a major
      factor leading to impaired quality of life. Nocturnal scratching is one of the factors
      causing sleep disturbance in AD patients. This study aims to develop and validate a digital
      algorithm for accurately and reliably detecting and quantifying nocturnal scratch behaviors
      related to AD using wrist actigraphy data.

      Wrist actigraphy is an investigational device being developed to detect and quantify
      scratching behaviors in patients with AD. This study will be conducted in 2 sequential
      stages: In Stage 1, an algorithm will be developed and in Stage 2 the algorithm developed
      will be validated. Adult healthy volunteers or participants with AD will be enrolled.
      Approximately 14 healthy volunteers, 14 AD patients with low disease activity and 28 AD
      patients with high disease activity will be enrolled in the study in 2-3 sites across the
      United States.

      No drug will be administered as a part of this study.

      Participants enrolled in this study may experience discomfort or inconvenience related to the
      study procedures. Participants will be enrolled and monitored overnight for two consecutive
      nights at an inpatient setting at a hospital or clinic. The impact of nocturnal scratching on
      sleep parameters will be assessed by videography, actigraphy, sleep headband and completing
      questionnaires.
