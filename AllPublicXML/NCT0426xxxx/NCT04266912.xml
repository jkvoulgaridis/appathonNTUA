      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of avelumab with M6620 in
      treating patients with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair (DDR) deficient solid tumors
      that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery
      (unresectable). DDR deficiency refers to a decrease in the ability of cells to respond to
      damaged DNA and to repair the damage, which can be caused by genetic mutations. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. M6620 may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      avelumab together with M6620 may help to control DDR deficient metastatic or unresectable
      solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of berzosertib (M6620) and
      avelumab in patients with DNA damage response (DDR) deficient advanced solid tumors. (Arm A:
      M6620 + avelumab) II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of the combination of M6620 and avelumab in patients with DDR deficient advanced
      solid tumors. (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical benefit of the combination as defined by clinical benefit rate
      (CBR) - complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD] &gt; 6 months (CR +
      PR + SD &gt; 6 months). (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab) II. To assess clinical benefit of the
      combination as defined by objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), duration of
      response (DoR) and progression free survival (PFS). (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical benefit of the combination of M6620 and avelumab based on specific
      DDR aberrations. (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab) II. To evaluate clinical benefit of the
      combination of M6620 and avelumab based on DDR gene expression signatures. (Arm A: M6620 +
      avelumab) III. To evaluate the impact of treatment on programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      expression and immune cell populations. (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab) IV. To assess potential
      mechanisms of resistance by comparing pre- and on-treatment biopsies in responders and
      non-responders. (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab) V. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of M6620 in combination with avelumab in patients with DDR
      deficient advanced solid tumors. (Arm A: M6620 + avelumab)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of M6620, followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and M6620 IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, then
      every 12 weeks afterwards.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and fertile men must agree to use adequate
             contraception when sexually active from signing of the informed consent form for the

             must agree to utilize 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception
             simultaneously. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile
             by bilateral orchiectomy. Men taking part in this study are advised not to father a
             child during and up to 6 months after treatment; prior to treatment, advice should be
             sought for conserving sperm due to the chance of irreversible infertility as a
             consequence of treatment. Female partners of childbearing potential from male study
             patients have to use adequate contraception / birth control between signing of the
             informed consent and 6 months after the last administration of the study drug if the
             male study patient is not sterilized. The investigator or a designated associate is
             requested to advise the patient how to achieve highly effective birth control. Highly
             effective (failure rate of less than 1% per year) contraception methods, when used
             consistently and correctly, include:

               -  Combined (estrogen and progestin containing: oral, intravaginal, transdermal) and
                  progestin-only (oral, injectable, implantable) hormonal contraception associated

                  sole sexual partner and has received medical assessment of the surgical success)

               -  Sexual abstinence (reliability to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the
                  clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient) Male

                  ensure that an additional form of contraception is also used during treatment and
                  until 6 months after last study drug administration. Patients must agree to
                  utilize 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception simultaneously
