  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well black raspberry nectar works in changing the gut microbiome and
      in reducing inflammatory processes that may lead to lung cancer. Studying the effects of
      black raspberry beverage on inflammation may help doctors find strategies to reduce the risk
      of developing lung cancer.

      PRIMARY FEASIBILITY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a diet intervention trial with longitudinal
      microbiome collection in Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) Lung
      Cancer Screening Clinic (OSUCCC-LCSC).

      PRIMARY SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the impact of the black raspberry (BRB) nectar intervention on the microbiome
      and inflammatory biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive BRB nectar orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for weeks 0-4 and then
      receive placebo PO BID for weeks 6-10 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also
      undergo collection of nasal swabs, blood, urine, and stool samples at weeks 0, 4, 6, and 10.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for weeks 0-4 and then receive BRB nectar PO BID for
      weeks 6-10 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo collection of nasal
      swabs, blood, urine, and stool samples at weeks 0, 4, 6, and 10.
