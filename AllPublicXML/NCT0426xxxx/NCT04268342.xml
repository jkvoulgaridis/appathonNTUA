  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nine sexual health clinical services across Australia and their associated pathology testing
      laboratories are implementing a new management program for gonorrhoea infection. The services
      are implementing the use of gonorrhoea drug resistance testing as part of routine clinical
      and laboratory practice, where drug resistance test results are provided to clinicians
      quickly to guide choice of antibiotic therapy. Clinicians will identify gonorrhoea infection
      that is ciprofloxacin susceptible so that it can be treated with ciprofloxacin therapy,
      rather than ceftriaxone.

      This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach to antibiotic stewardship
      based on individually tailored antibiotic prescribing. Nine sexual health clinical services
      from across Australia with high caseloads of gay and bisexual men and Aboriginal and Torres
      Strait Islander clients, will adopt a new management practice for gonorrhoea infection
      involving provision of tailored antibiotic therapy by clinicians at the time of gonorrhoea
      diagnosis and treatment, guided by the results of resistance testing. The services are
      implementing the use of gonorrhoea drug resistance testing as part of routine clinical and
      laboratory practice, where drug resistance test results are provided to clinicians quickly to
      guide choice of antibiotic therapy. This differs from existing practice where the prolonged
      turn-around times for drug resistance testing results mean clinicians must prescribe drug
      therapy without knowing these results. This can lead to increasing levels of drug resistance
      to ceftriaxone.

      The drug resistance test used in the new program detects genetic material (nucleic acids). It
      was developed and validated in Australia and is as accurate as existing culture-based drug
      resistance testing but provides quicker results. Patients treated presumptively at their
      first clinic visit will be treated with standard of care ceftriaxone. However, for cases
      treated at the return visit, clinicians will identify gonorrhoea infection that is
      ciprofloxacin susceptible so that it can be treated with ciprofloxacin therapy, rather than
      ceftriaxone. This will preserve ceftriaxone for situations where it must be used as the only
      effective drug available. Established patient follow-up procedures at clinical services will
      confirm that treatment has been successful.

      Quantitative data from the clinical and laboratory services in the study will be used to
      assess the cure rate in gonorrhoea cases within the new management program versus standard
      care. The proportion of all cases treated with ceftriaxone will be also be assessed which
      will help illustrate the impact of the new management program.

    <intervention_model_description>The stepped-wedge design used for this program evaluation will allow comparison of the standard practice for gonorrhoea management based on injected ceftriaxone (at sites in the control phase) with individualised treatment based on drug resistance testing (at sites in the implementation phase). The unit of randomisation is each group of three clinical services.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The acceptability of the new management program to clinic and laboratory staff and stakeholders will be assessed through a qualitative research study design. Service staff and external stakeholders will be selected purposively to take part in semi-structured in-depth interviews at different stages of the study. Sampling will be informed by data saturation. All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative data will be analysed using a system of thematic 'open' and 'axial' coding. Findings will be descriptive.</description>

    <description>When clinical services are in the standard case phase of the study, all cases of gonorrhoea infection diagnosed at those services will be managed according to current standard of care management guidelines i.e. all cases of gonorrhoea infection will be treated with ceftriaxone by injection plus oral azithromycin tablets as first line therapy, regardless of whether the treatment is given at the initial clinic or the return clinic visit.</description>

    <description>When clinical services are assigned to the implementation phase, first line treatment for gonorrhoea infection for patients treated at their first clinic visit will remain the same as it is currently: ceftriaxone by injection plus oral azithromycin tablets. However, patients who are not treated presumptively will be treated at their return visit on the basis of the drug resistance test results. Patients with gonorrhoea infection that is shown to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin will be treated with oral ciprofloxacin therapy when they return for review at clinical services in the implementation phase. Patients with gonorrhoea infection that is not susceptible to ciprofloxacin or with an indeterminate ciprofloxacin result will be treated with ceftriaxone by injection.</description>
