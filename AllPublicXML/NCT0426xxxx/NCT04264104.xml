  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effects of two diferente doses of nervous system mobilization
      on athletes performance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that 60 athletes will be randomly allocated to receive either 4x10 (n=30)
      or 8x10 (n=30) repetitions of neural mobilization .

      Data on flexibility (knee extension test) and lower limb strength and motor control (hop
      tests and vertical jump test) will be collected at baseline and after the neural
      mobilization.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.
