  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study is proposed to test whether adding additional referees to youth soccer matches may
      reduce the risk of injury to the children playing soccer. Publicly-open youth soccer games
      will be randomly assigned to have either one or three referees and videotaped. The videotaped
      games will then be watched to record risk-taking behavior by players, referee decisions, and
      other factors relevant to potential injury.
