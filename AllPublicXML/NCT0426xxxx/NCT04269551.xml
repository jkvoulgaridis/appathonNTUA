      Primary Objective:

      To assess the safety and tolerability in participants with cold agglutinin disease (CAD),
      after a single dose of intravenous (IV) BIVV020

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess, in participants with cold agglutinin disease, after a single dose of intravenous
      (IV) BIVV020:

        -  The effect of BIVV020 on complement mediated hemolysis

        -  The pharmacodynamics (PD) of BIVV020 relating to complement inhibition

        -  The pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIVV020

        -  The immunogenicity of BIVV020

          -  Documented vaccinations against encapsulated bacterial pathogens (Neisseria
             meningitidis, including serogroup B meningococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) within
             five years of screening or willing to complete protocol specified vaccinations.

          -  Having given written informed consent prior to undertaking any study-related
             procedure.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Cold agglutinin syndrome secondary to infection, rheumatologic disease, or known high
             grade hematologic malignancy, or known solid organ tumor.

          -  Clinically relevant infection of any kind within one month preceding screening.

          -  Treatment with anti-CD20 monotherapy within three months or anti CD20 combination
             therapies within six months prior to screening.

          -  Concurrent treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents targeting B- or T-cell
             function and/or cytotoxic agents within 3 months prior to screening. Concurrent
             treatment with other systemic immunosuppressants within 5.5 half-lives of the drug
             prior to screening.

          -  Any specific complement system inhibitor within three months prior to screening.

          -  Concurrent treatment with systemic corticosteroids other than a stable daily dose
             equivalent to ≤10 mg/day prednisone within three months prior to screening.

          -  If female, pregnant or lactating.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
