    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective pilot study for longitudinal assessment of fecal
      microbiome related to medical and surgical weight loss. The investigators follow the standard
      of care for perioperative and intraoperative management of study participants. The only
      addition to the standard of care protocol will be collection of fecal samples at 3 time
      points. This will enable investigators to compare changes in and effects by microbiota after
      low-calorie diet versus after bariatric surgery .

    <description>Test for intrapersonal longitudinal changes in human gut microbiota in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery at 3 time points: baseline (preoperative), after diet-induced non-surgical weight loss, and 3-months post-operative.
Metagenomic characterization of gut microbial communities will be longitudinally examined with human feces at 3 time points. Microbiota profiles will be assessed in fecal samples using V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene by MiSeq 250-base paired-end multiplex sequencing. Moreover, total microbial cell counts in fecal samples will be determined using flow cytometry in order to have a quantitative microbiome profiling.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be an eligible candidate for bariatric surgery based on standard criteria in place,
             have been enrolled in bariatric surgery program at Cleveland Clinic Main Campus, and
             have been cleared and approved for bariatric surgery by the BMI bariatric program and
             his/her health insurance

          -  Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) more than 35 kg/m2

          -  Have type 2 diabetes (T2D) (but not type 1 diabetes, see exclusion criteria) as
             defined by

               1. If untreated (as per ADA standards of care) FPG &gt; or = 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L).
                  Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h OR 2-h PG &gt; or = 200
                  mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the
                  WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75-g anhydrous glucose
                  dissolved in water OR A1C &gt; or = 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed
                  in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the
                  DCCT assay OR In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or
                  hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose &gt; or = 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).

               2. the use of any antidiabetic drug or glucose lowering agent, including biguanides
                  (metformin), thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylurea,
                  meglitinides, DPP4-inhibitors, GLP1-agonists, SGLT2i, any type of insulin.
