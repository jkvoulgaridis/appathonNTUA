      Prospective study in HIV-1 infected adult subjects with HIV-associated neurocognitive
      disorders despite effective antiretroviral therapy in plasma for more than one year,
      analyzing the evolution of cognitive disorders and markers of macrophagic inflammation in
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid, after a change in HIV treatment with an increased of the new
      scale CHARTER score ≥ 3 (total treatment score to be ≥ 9)

      Neurocognitive disorders are measured using Frascati 3-stage classification and Global
      Deficit Score, after the following 10 standardized battery test: Grooved Pegboard for
      dominant and non-dominant hand, Grefex Verbal Fluency, California Verbal Learning Test
      (CVLT), Digit Span Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III, modified Paced Auditory Serial
      Addition Test (60 items), WAIS III Digit Symbol Test, Trail Making Test A&amp;B, recall of CVLT
      and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and after the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI), Inventory
      of Activity Daily Living part II (IADL) and 10-items Cognitive Complaint Questionnaire (CCQ).
      The global CNS Penetration Effectiveness (CPE) score of ARV treatment are the sum of the
      scores of each ARV the patient received, according to the last published scoring. For each
      drug class, we considered treatment intensification only for drugs with CPE score reaching at
      least 3 (no intensification if switch in same drug class with same CPE score). CPE score was
      corrected by drugs resistance status, using cumulative genotype interpreted with the 2012
      ANRS algorithm (www.hivfrenchresistance.org; v.2012) at inclusion (CPE=0 if resistance).

    <description>IHFB001 (Neuroplustrois) is a pilot study, phase IV, open-label, multicenter in Ile-de-France region, trying to demonstrate the improvement of cognitive change after treatment characterized by its better diffusion in the central nervous system. The characteristics of the change in treatment are (Cn - Ci) ≥ 3 and Cn ≥ 9, where Cn is the Charter score of the new treatment and Ci the Charter score of the initial treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject (male or female) with HIV-1 infection

          2. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Subject with a plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) undetectable for at least one year or
             with minimal replication &lt;500 copies/ml for at least one year at the inclusion date

          4. Patient with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders : at least two ability domains,
             documented by performance of at least 1.0 standard deviation below the mean for
             age-education appropriate norms on standardized neuropsychological tests

          5. Patient is willing and able to understand and provide written informed consent prior
             to participation in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with HIV-2 infection

          2. Subject with plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA)&gt; 500 copies/ml in the past year

          3. Subject with acquired impairment in cognitive functioning involving only one ability
             domain, or involving at least two ability domains but with performance better than 1.0
             standard deviation below the mean (no evidence of potential cognitive impairment)

          4. Subject unable, according to the investigator, to meet the study requirements,
             including patients unable to perform cognitive tests

          5. Subject with acute intercurrent disease

          6. Patient with positive serology for HCV or HBsAg positive

          7. Subject with cognitive impairment related to another cause than HIV: other CNS
             infection, CNS neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, preexisting neurologic disease or
             metabolic disorders, severe substance abuse, or systemic disease.

          8. Subject with a brain MRI or CSF analysis results that suggest another pathology than
             HIV associated neurocognitive disorder

          9. Subject requires treatment with immunomodulating agents (or may require such treatment
             during the two years monitoring) such as systemic corticosteroïds, interferons,
             interleukins, growth factor GM- CSF, or other targeted therapy that may interfere with
             macrophage markers of the study

         10. Subject requires treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents

         11. Subject at which the initial lumbar punction can't be achieved

         12. Subject ≥65 years at the inclusion date, age with high risk of atherosclerotic disease

         13. Subject with significant depression : with a score ≥29 (or score

             ≥20 without questions 15 to 21) at Beck Depression Inventory II (1996 version), the
             neuropsychologist doesn't conduct the battery of cognitive tests

         14. Subject under curatorship or guardianship

         15. Subject at which the initial cerebral MRI can't be achieved
