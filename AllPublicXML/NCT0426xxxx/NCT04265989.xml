      This study is aim to present a new classification for coronary artery ectasia and find the
      best interventional therapy for different types of patients were treated and studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery ectasia refers to a variety of reasons cause coronary artery expansion, its
      diameter is more than 1.5 times that of the adjacent normal coronary artery. Clinical
      symptoms include angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death.At present, there is no
      consensus on the mechanism and treatment of the disease, which may be related to the
      structural failure of the vessel wall and abnormal hemodynamics in the dilated segment.Most
      of the existing studies are case reports or single-center retrospective analysis of small
      samples, with low level of evidence.As a common fluid analysis method in the field of
      engineering, computational fluid dynamics can effectively simulate the movement and stress
      state of blood under reasonable model assumptions.By comparing the preoperative and
      postoperative data of real cases, the validity of simulation analysis results can be
      tested.The purpose of this study is to carry out a multi-center study combining morphological
      and hemodynamic factors, to propose a new classification and interventional treatment
      strategy for atherosclerotic coronary artery ectasia, and to provide evidence-based medical
      evidence for the development of treatment guidelines.
