  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain concerns one in four adults in Belgium. Fibromyalgia is an example of chronic
      pain and is characterized by diffused and migrant musculo-tendinous pain localized in the
      limbs and at an axial level. The technological improvement in neuroimaging allowed to
      improve, at a cerebral level, the identification of the structural and the functional
      characteristics of this clinical entity. Studies indicated a modification in cerebral
      morphometry showing an alteration of white and grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex,
      orbitofrontal lateral cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia, insula, secondary somatosensory
      cortex, thalamus, amygdala, putamen, superior temporal gyrus and periaqueductal grey matter.
      At a functional level, studies show un alteration in the connectivity of the default mode
      network, an atrophy of zones implicated in nociception and an increased activation of zone
      implicated in response to a nociceptive stimulus.

      Nowadays, researchers are interested in finding out the beneficial effects of
      non-pharmacological techniques to improve de well-being of patients with chronic pain.
      Hypnosis is one of these techniques that has already proven to be successful in decreasing
      pain and improving global quality of life. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no study has been
      conducted to understand the impact of hypnosis upon the cerebral functioning of these
      patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the impact of a 6 months
      self-hypnosis/self-care learning program upon the structural and functional functioning of
      the brain by means of functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) and electroencephalography
      (EEG).

    <intervention_model_description>Each patients will have a medical and a psychological consultation and will have to fill-in questionnaires (T0). Then, they will receive a psycho-education training (5 sessions) and will have to complete the same questionnaires (T1). After that, they will again have a medical (pain doctor) and a psychological consultation. Afterwards, the care staff will have a multidisciplinary discussion about their diagnosis. Then functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI; 1 hour) and HdEEG (1 hour) data will be acquired in resting state. After that, participants will receive a 7 months (2 hours session a month) learning program of self-hypnosis/self-care animated by a therapist specialized in hypnosis. After the 7 months learning-program they will complete the same questionnaires (T2) and be scanned again by means of fMRI and HdEEG. Patient who do not want to participate to the learning program will not have a treatment but will be scanned in the fMRI and the HdEEG.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It is a 7-months 2 hours-session (1 session per month) of self-hypnosis/self-care learning. Participants are given strategies to learn self-care (knowing their needs, self-respect, communication etc.), each strategy is discussed for participant to understand them and thus apply them correctly in daily life. An hypnosis exercise is conducted at the end of each session. A CD with the audiotaped hypnosis exercise is given to each patient so that they can practice also every day.</description>
