  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of periodontitis has been hypothesized as a risk factor for several systemic
      outcomes, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      evaluate the impact of non-surgical periodontal treatment on CRP levels and quality of life
      of patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis (HD) in Santa Maria-RS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      C-reactive protein (CRP) has been identified as a possible mediator of the association
      between periodontitis and various systemic diseases. The presence of periodontitis has been
      hypothesized as a risk factor for several systemic outcomes, including chronic kidney disease
      (CKD). Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of non-surgical periodontal
      treatment on CRP levels and quality of life of patients with chronic kidney disease
      undergoing hemodialysis (HD) in Santa Maria-RS. A total of 88 patients with severe
      periodontitis who are on HD therapy will be included in this study. At baseline, periodontal,
      radiographic, blood test, and quality-of-life questionnaire will be assessed for all
      patients, after which severe periodontitis will be defined according to the American
      Association of Periodontology and European Federation of Periodontology. The 88 patients with
      periodontal disease will be randomized and divided into two groups. One group will receive
      full mouth non-surgical periodontal treatment (TPNC) and a late treatment group that will
      receive TPNC only at the end of the study. All patients will receive follow-up of periodontal
      parameters and blood collection for initial CRP assessment at 3 and 6 months after treatment.
      Outcome evaluators will be blind to the group the patient belongs to. Patients in the
      immediate treatment group will receive follow-up oral hygiene instructions and use 0.12%
      chlorhexidine mouthwash during the first week after treatment.

    <description>Individuals' psychological condition will be assessed using the sense of coherence (SOC 13) which proposes to explain successful strategies to cope with stress. For the final score calculation, the items are summed and the result can vary from 13 to 65, where higher scores represent SOC. The the greater the result, the greater the coping capacity.</description>
