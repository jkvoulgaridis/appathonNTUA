  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To evaluate the long-term effect of the AMS program on the consumption of broad-spectrum
           antibiotics and on the consumption of antibiotics in general (sustainability of the
           efficacy of the program). More specifically, the investigators shall examine the
           consumption of protected antibiotics during the years 2019 - 2020 and they shall compare
           it with the consumption of antibiotics before the implementation of the AMS program.

        2. To evaluate the impact of the AMS program, combined with an infection control program,
           on the incidence of MDRGN infections in a hospital with high MDR incidence. Confounding
           factors are a barrier to analyze the impact of ASPs on antibiotic resistance. In a
           hospital setting, one of the most important confounding factors is the implementation of
           infection control practices at the same time as the ASPs. It is extremely difficult to
           infer causality between an ASP and antibiotic resistance reduction when infection
           control is a confounding factor, especially if the study intervention combines an ASP
           and infection control practices performed at the same time. The way to go around the
           problem is to implement ASP and IC at different time points. The investigators
           implemented the ASP program in September 2015 and they added the IC program in September
           2018. Therefore, the investigators shall be able to compare the two-time periods (i.e.
           ASP alone vs. ASP/IC) by using the time series analysis and delineate the impact of each
           intervention.

        3. To evaluate the effect of the AMS program on patient outcomes (in-hospital mortality,
           length of stay)
