    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a lifestyle intervention works in reducing breast cancer risk
      through changing body composition and decreasing inflammation in normal weight women. This
      trial may help researchers learn more about diet and exercise programs designed to decrease
      body fat in postmenopausal women who are of normal weight but have an elevated risk of breast
      cancer because of excess body fat.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of a diet and exercise intervention to decrease body fat in
      postmenopausal women with normal body mass index (BMI) but high body fat (trunk fat mass 9.4
      kg, the 50th percentile of normal BMI women in the Women's Health Initiative [WHI]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess preliminary efficacy of the intervention by evaluating the post-intervention
      differences between the intervention and control groups in:

      IIa. Circulating markers of inflammation and metabolic dysfunction linked to both excess
      adiposity and breast cancer (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], fasting insulin,
      leptin, IL-6, triglycerides, sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG], adiponectin, and high
      density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol).

      IIb. Body composition body fat, trunk fat mass, fat mass, lean mass, fat-free mass).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Exploratory outcomes include fitness (oxygen consumption VO2 peak, sit-to-stand test),
      behavior (physical activity, energy intake, macronutrient consumption), and quality of life
      (global health-related quality of life, physical functioning, sleep, menopausal symptoms).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants complete lifestyle intervention consisting of 1-3 sets of
      high-resistance circuit training sessions per week, up to 150 minutes of aerobic training per
      week, and diet recommendations from a health coach or registered dietitian twice per week for
      16 weeks.

      GROUP II: Participants are placed on a wait-list and then complete lifestyle intervention
      after 4 months.
