             study, for subsequent visits HBVDNA testing must be performed according to the
             Schedule of Activities.

          4. History of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a therapeutic drug.

          5. History of recent active infections within 28 days prior to the screening visit.

          6. Participants with a fever within 48 hours prior to dosing.

          7. History of tuberculosis or active, latent or inadequately treated tuberculosis
             infection as defined by the following:

             Have evidence of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent Mycobacterium
             tuberculosis (TB) infection as evidenced by the following:

               1. A positive QuantiFERON TB Gold In Tube (QFT-G) test or positive or borderline
                  T-SPOT.TB (T Spot) test performed within the 12 weeks prior to Day 1. If the
                  laboratory reports the test as indeterminate, the test should be repeated. If the
                  result of the repeat test is indeterminate, a purified protein derivative (PPD)
                  test may be substituted for the QFT-G test or T-Spot test only with approval from
                  the Pfizer Medical Monitor on a case by case basis.

               2. Chest radiograph with changes suggestive of active TB infection within 3 months
                  prior to Screening. Chest radiograph should be performed according to local
                  standards of care or country specific guidelines.

               3. History of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB
                  infection.

             If a participant has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either
             latent (9 months of isoniazid in a locale where rates of primary multi drug resistant
             TB infection are &lt;5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi
             drug regimen) TB infection, neither a QFT-G test, a T-Spot test, nor a PPD test need
             be obtained. Details of the previous course of therapy (eg, medication(s) used, dose,
             duration of therapy) should be documented in the source documentation.

             A chest radiograph should be obtained if not done within the 3 months prior to
             Screening. To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be
             negative for active TB infection.

             A participant who is currently being treated for active TB infection must be excluded
             from the study.

             A participant who is being treated for latent TB infection can only be enrolled with
             confirmation of current incidence rates of multi drug resistant TB infection,
             documentation of an adequate treatment regimen, and prior approval of the Sponsor.

          8. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of
             investigational product.

         10. Recent exposure to live vaccines within 28 days of the screening visit.

         11. Known exposure to anti-TL1A (PF-06480605) or any type of anti-TL1A therapy.

         12. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 4 months (or as determined
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).

         13. A positive urine drug test.

         14. Screening supine blood pressure (BP) &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90
             mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.

         15. Baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results
             (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block
             [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval
             changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree atrioventricular
             [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline
             uncorrected QT interval is &gt;450 msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the
             Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and
             reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be
             repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to
             determine the participant's eligibility. Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread
             by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.

         16. History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer, 1
             ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).

         17. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations and platelet donations) of approximately
             &gt;=400 mL within 3 months or &gt;=200 mL within a month prior to dosing. Additionally,
             approximately &gt;=400 mL within 4 months for female participants.

         18. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

         19. History of substance abuse within 12 months of the screening visit.

         20. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females.

         21. Males who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as
             outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and until discharge from the
             study.

         22. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations
             section of this protocol.

         23. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.
