      The purpose of this research is to validate the moral injury symptom scale clinician version
      short form with AdventHealth Orlando clinicians. Participants will be recruited in accordance
      with AdventHealth Policy # 400.120: Selection and Enrollment of AdventHealth Employees,
      Physicians, and Volunteers for research Studies. Employee participants will be assured
      participation in this study will not affect performance evaluation or employment-related
      decisions by peers or supervisors. No employees will be recruited by a direct supervisor.
      Recruitment of potential employees as participants will occur without coercion by the
      Principal Investigator (PI), by bulletin board advertisements, or through a third party
      unassociated in a power/supervisory relationship with the employee (i.e., researchers from
      Center for Whole-Person Research).
