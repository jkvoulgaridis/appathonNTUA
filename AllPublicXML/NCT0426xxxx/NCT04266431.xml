  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a lifestyle intervention focused on weight loss, EMPOWER,
      reduces prostate cancer progression at 12 months among men with biochemical recurrence
      following local treatment for prostate cancer. Half of the men will be randomized to receive
      the EMPOWER intervention, while the other half will receive standard of care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 500,000 US men are living with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer (BCR).
      Therapies are needed to delay the appearance of metastatic disease and need for androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT), which has significant adverse side effects. Observational evidence
      suggests that weight loss may slow the rate of disease progression. The EMPOWER trial will
      use an enhanced version of a remote weight loss intervention shown to yield clinically
      significant weight loss to test whether weight loss reduces prostate cancer progression at 12
      months. EMPOWER has the potential to provide men with BCR a &quot;first line therapy&quot; to slow
      disease progression and delay the need for ADT. Importantly, this &quot;treatment&quot; is without
      significant side effects, and can improve overall health.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible consented men will be stratified for randomization according to prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSADT; &lt;6 months or 6-12 months) calculated using 3 values (≥1 week apart; ≤ 3 months from randomization; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center prediction tool: http://nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/PsaDoublingTime.aspx), and body mass index (BMI) at baseline (25 kg/m2 ≤BMI &lt;30 kg/m2 or BMI≥ 30 kg/m2). Following stratification, men will be randomized 1:1 using a computer-generated, password protected randomization enrollment system by the biostatistician. Men will be informed of the random assignment after consenting to the study and completing the baseline questionnaires and blood collection. Study visits will take place at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after baseline.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>EMPOWER is a multichannel, behavioral lifestyle intervention delivered remotely. The goals of EMPOWER are to induce a loss of 5% or more of initial weight within 6 months and to maintain these improvements at 12 and 24 months, by meeting dietary and physical activity goals. Coach-participant contacts will occur by phone and email, without in-person visits. Coaching contacts will be weekly for the first 12 weeks and then monthly thereafter. Men will have access to a web-based system that (1) provides support for behavioral methods of weight management and (2) allows coaches to review participant self-monitoring data and monitor participant progress towards goals. Men will record diet, exercise, and weight on the web or on a smart phone application.</description>

    <description>Men randomized to the standard of care group will continue to receive treatment from the mens' medical oncologist. These men will also be provided with a one page informative brochure on lifestyle recommendations adapted from the American Cancer Society Prostate Cancer Survivorship Care Guidelines, at the time of randomization. At the end of the trial, men in this arm will be offered a one-time counseling session with an intervention coach on healthy lifestyle.</description>
