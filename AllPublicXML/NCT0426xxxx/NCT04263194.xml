  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe alterations of brain networks connectivity have been described in Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has gained evidence as an effective
      tool to modulate brain networks connectivity, leading to a recovery or reorganization of both
      local and remote brain regions functionally connected to the stimulated area. The
      investogators propose an innovative tailored network-based rTMS treatment to ameliorate
      cognitive symptoms in mild AD, through the boosting of connectivity within brain networks
      affected by AD pathophysiology. The combination of the proposed intervention with an
      integrated multi-modal imaging approach will allow to evaluate the neural mechanisms
      underlying the clinical response to the treatment and to define quantitative markers of
      clinical impact on AD. If successful, the present proposal would immediately impact on
      patient's quality of life, with important implications for the time and costs of delivery of
      rehabilitative services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no effective cure is available for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has gained increasing attention as a potential
      treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders, but available rTMS studies are
      flawed by inaccurate anatomical targeting, inadequate sample size, unsatisfactory controls
      and lacking blindness. To date, the elective target area of rTMS interventions in AD has been
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a core area of the Central Executive network
      (CEN), which plays a key role in regulating executive functions, attention and working
      memory. While the CEN has recently been described as dysfunctional in AD, AD pathophysiology
      has been mainly associated with the breakdown of the Default Mode network (DMN) and with
      structural disconnection of its parietal nodes. The DMN plays a crucial role in episodic
      memory retrieval and incorporates various brain regions, among which parietal areas are
      highly connected with the rest of the brain. The present multicenter, double-blind,
      randomized and placebo-controlled study has the ambition to provide evidence of the efficacy
      of two tailored network-based rTMS treatments in mild AD, through the enhancement of
      connectivity of CEN and DMN. Innovative integrated multi-modal imaging investigations will
      further enrich this proposal allowing to identify quantifiable markers underlying the
      clinical impact of rTMS on AD.

    <intervention_model_description>After recruitment, patients will be randomized and assigned to one of three rTMS treatments: DMN (N=20), CEN (N=20) or placebo (N=20). The rTMS treatment will consist of 2 phases: an intensive phase and a maintenance phase. The intensive phase will involve 3 weeks of treatment, 5 days per week (15 sessions in total). The maintenance will consist of 1 session of treatment every 2 weeks for 5 months (10 sessions in total). Overall, the patients will undergo 25 sessions of rTMS delivered over 6 months. At baseline (T0), at the end of the intensive phase (T1) and at the end of the maintenance phase (T2) all patients will undergo a clinical and cognitive assessment and a multi-modal imaging data collection.</intervention_model_description>
