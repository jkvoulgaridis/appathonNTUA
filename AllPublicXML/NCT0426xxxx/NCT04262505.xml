    <textblock>
      The MEDRA study is a randomised, parallel intervention study over 12 weeks period that aims
      to assess the feasibility and effects of a Mediterranean diet intervention to determine
      change in inflammatory risk profile, disease activity, functional status and quality of life
      in adults living with Rheumatoid Arthritis in Ireland (MEDRA study). Investigators will be
      able to determine how closely Irish people accept the Mediterranean dietary practices and
      adhere to them with dietetic input and guidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term inflammatory disease which commonly occurs in the
      small joints of the hands, wrists and feet leading to swelling, pain and stiffness in the
      affected joints. The condition is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men.
      Although it might occur at any age, the incidence of the disease is highest between the ages
      of 40 and 65 years. Currently, there is no treatment that provides complete remission of the
      disease for people living with RA. Treatment of RA aims to reduce the symptoms and improve
      the health of the patient. Although diet is not part of the mainstream treatment, many
      studies have reported beneficial effects of certain diets on RA symptoms. The MEDRA study
      aims to examine the habitual dietary intakes of people living with RA in Ireland and explore
      its association with the inflammatory status, disease activity and functional state of the
      disease. The study will also examine if people living with RA can benefit from a
      Mediterranean type dietary intervention by exploring whether the Mediterranean diet improves
      the inflammatory risk profile and disease activity for these people. It is important to
      conduct this pilot and feasibility study in order to observe if people with RA can adhere to
      the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet) prescription and whether the intervention will have
      beneficial impact on function and quality of life. This is important work prior to proceeding
      to larger intervention studies.

    <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life questionnaire (RAQoL) will be used to describe the individuals' perceptions, satisfaction, and evaluation of different areas of their own lives, such as physical health and functioning, psychological and emotional well-being, social roles, and relationships. A scale 1 to 30 will be used whereby the higher the score, the worse the QoL.</description>

    <description>DAS28 will be calculated to monitor changes in disease activity. The DAS28 examination involves the assessment of 28 joints including the shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees and joints in the hand as well as blood test (ESR or CRP) results. Lower scores indicate disease remission.</description>

    <description>The intervention is based on components of the traditional Mediterranean diet which is primarily a plant based diet and emphasises intakes of vegetables, whole grains and fruit with the main added fat being extra virgin olive oil.The diet will be modified and tailored to cultured preferences by the registered dietitian. Participants will be informed of their diet allocation group during the baseline visit and will commence the diet the following day or as soon as is feasible for 12 weeks. Participants will be provided with printed resources specifically designed to explain the components of the Mediterranean diet and how it will be followed. A food hamper will be provided to demonstrate the key staple foods (canned legumes, tinned salmon, extra virgin olive oil and nuts) of the Med diet and to encourage adherence to same.</description>
