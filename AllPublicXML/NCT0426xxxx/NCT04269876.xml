  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of a
      Marine Lipid Oil Concentrate formulation on inflammation.. Each subject will receive a
      specific dose of the study product (A) to be taken once daily with a specific dose of the
      study product (B) to be taken once daily for a total of 60 days.

      Participants will receive questionnaires, assessments, blood tests, vital signs and a body
      composition analysis.

      The primary objective is the assessment of the change in the blood levels of hs-CRP in
      response to the Marine Lipid Oil Concentrate formulation relative to screening/baseline
      compared to placebo.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of the change in the in response to the Marine
      Lipid Oil Concentrate formulation relative to screening/baseline compared to placebo for
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
      (ESR), Fibrinogen Activity, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), Ferritin, Blood lipid levels
      (Total Cholesterol, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL),
      Triglycerides), Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey scores and the Medical Symptoms
      Questionnaire
