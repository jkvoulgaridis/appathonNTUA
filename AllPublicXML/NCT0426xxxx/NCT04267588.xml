  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain is a public health epidemic. The current protocol seeks to develop technology
      to aid patients' tracking of patients' pain, medications and pain-related variables. The
      investigators seek to talk with patients in co-investigator's clinic to solicit feedback, as
      well as pilot test the technology with pain patients.

    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans, costs the US over $630 billion annually, and
      reduces quality of life. It is among the most clinically challenging and financially
      burdensome conditions facing clinicians and healthcare organizations. Sleep disturbance is
      common in chronic pain conditions with some studies reporting a prevalence as high as
      70%-88%. Psychiatric disorders, including substance abuse and mood disorders are prevalent in
      chronic pain and are associated with impairment and decreased quality of life. Sleep is
      increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of mental health. Taken together,
      epidemiological, cross-sectional, and prospective studies support the hypothesis that
      insomnia, chronic pain, and depression are mutually interacting, each increasing the risk for
      the emergence and/or exacerbation of the other. The gold standard of chronic pain management
      is multidisciplinary pain treatment (MPT), but patients rarely receive MPT secondary to
      limited access and a severe shortage of pain management specialists. Thus, there is an urgent
      need for empirically supported, cost-effective multidisciplinary pain self-management options
      that are accessible to patients and trusted by primary and tertiary care providers. To
      address this problem, the investigators' group in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins
      Technology Innovation Center (TIC) has developed a mobile chronic pain, medication and
      symptom tracking digital technology platform designed to eventually support multidisciplinary
      pain treatment by enhancing patient-provider communication and delivering comprehensive,
      personalized, interactive evidence-based pain management strategies. The investigators' App
      (version 1.3) is currently able to collect self-report data (i.e., pain; sleep; mood;
      catastrophizing; stress; pain flares) and continuous, passively collected wearable biosensor
      data (i.e., heart rate; breathing; sleep; heart rate variability/stress). The investigators
      propose a prospective, observational proof of concept study to demonstrate feasibility and
      adherence while establishing the psychometric properties of a mobile pain App and to compare
      these data with passively collected physiological data and laboratory indices of pain in
      patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).

    <description>The investigators propose to collect self-report and passively collected biological data and evaluate participants' relation to clinical and laboratory pain as well as patients' willingness to use and level of comfort with the mobile pain management digital platform and wearable biosensors. Eligible participants will be consented, given two biosensors (i.e., Apple Watch Series 1 with KardiaBand; Spire), a sleep monitoring device (actigraph watch), and a mobile app enabled smartphone, then trained on how to use the app (and device if appropriate) and biosensors. Participants will keep medications constant and not have any new pain treatment procedures over the course of the study period and 2 weeks prior to starting the study.</description>
