  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test how well patients with advanced solid tumors and ovarian
      cancer respond to treatment with BAY1895344 in combination with niraparib. In addition
      researchers want to find for patients the optimal dose of BAY1895344 in combination with
      niraparib, how the drug is tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and discharges
      the drug. The study medication BAY1895344 works by blocking a substance produced by the body
      (ATR Kinase) which is important for the growth of tumor cells. Niraparib works by blocking a
      substance produced by the body (PARP enzymes) in a way that tumor cells can be killed, or
      made more susceptible to chemotherapy.
