  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to determine the effect of presenting psychoeducation emphasizing
      &quot;growth-mindset,&quot; and information on depression and anxiety symptom severity. The
      investigators hypothesize that psychoeducation emphasizing that mental health is malleable
      will increase the participant's engagement with risk factors outlined in the intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety disorders (or common mental disorders; CMDs) are increasingly common
      among college students, with rates comparable to the general population. As such, brief,
      scalable and transdiagnostic prevention efforts targeting CMDs are needed. In order to
      address this need, this study aims to evaluate the impact of a single session intervention
      (SSI) utilizing growth mindset (GM) on CMD symptom severity and investigate the mediating
      role of changes in modifiable risk factors in the relationship between intervention and CMD
      symptom reduction. The intervention will adapt existing GM interventions for college students
      to engage mechanisms in the prevention and management of common mental disorders including
      engagement in modifiable risk factors. College students will be randomly assigned to complete
      either a GM intervention or a psychoeducation control.
