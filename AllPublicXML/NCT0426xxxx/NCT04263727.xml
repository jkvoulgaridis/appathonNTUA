  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TARGET-RWE is a 10-year, international, longitudinal, observational study of patients with
      chronic disease designed to specifically address important clinical questions that remain
      incompletely answered from registration trials. The protocol will follow a master protocol
      design in which a shared study infrastructure supports progressive development of the
      registry across the spectrum of chronic diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TARGET-RWE master protocol design allows shared study parameters and operational
      components to be organized within a centralized platform. Utilizing this platform,
      therapeutic area-aligned Communities with associated Disease-Specific Cohorts (DSC) can be
      added according to scientific merit and need to address specific research questions in
      patients diagnosed with chronic diseases. This design capitalizes on a shared, sustainable
      infrastructure across a diverse patient population, which allows for more efficient
      coordination and conduct than can be achieved in traditional stand-alone,
      independently-conducted research studies with narrowly-focused target patient populations.
      This master protocol design will ultimately support a dynamic program that adapts to the
      changing landscape of chronic disease management and allows for rapid enrollment and
      collection of retrospective and long-term prospective data from participants in specific
      disease areas of interest.

      TARGET-RWE currently includes the TARGET-RWE.LUNG Community, with open DSCs for Asthma, COPD
      and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

      Patients enrolled in TARGET-RWE may be invited to participate in the Biorepository Bank
      (BSB). Blood samples for biomarker and DNA assays will be collected on a voluntary basis and
      participation in this project will not affect participation in the main study. These samples
      will be shipped to a central repository for storage to use in future studies. Samples stored
      at the biorepository will be identified only with the participant's unique study ID number
      and the date the sample was obtained.
