  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase Ib study is to evaluate the safety of a Sabin Inactivated
      Poliovirus Vaccine (sIPV) in adults and children, and the safety and immunogenicity of it in
      infants. 20 adults aged 18~45 years and 20 children aged 4 years were only administered one
      dose of sIPV with high D antigen content. 20 infants aged 2 months (60~90 days) were
      administered three doses of sIPV with high D antigen content, on the month 0, 1, 2 schedule.
      Serum samples were collected before the 1st dose and 30 days after the 3rd dose vaccination
      to assess the immunogenicity in infants. Adverse events occurring within 30 days after each
      dose were collected to assess the safety.

      The antigen contents of type I, type II and type III polioviruses in the high-dose Sabin IPV
      were 22 DU, 65 DU and 65 DU. All vaccines were in liquid form, 0.5 ml per dose.
