  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The investigators aim is to indicate that the &quot;goal directed fluid management&quot; is
      more effective for open abdominal surgeries by performing perioperative hemodynamic
      monitorisation using a minimal invasive pulse counter analysis method.

      Methods: The study will be included 90 participants with ASA II-III risk score aged from
      18-64 years. The prospective and randomized participants will be divided into 2 groups as
      liberal (Group L) and goal-directed fluid therapy (Group G) fluid treatment. Hemodynamic
      parameters and arterial blood gas analysis will be recorded at 30 min intervals. Preoperative
      and postoperative creatinine values, CR-POSSUM physiological score, Charlson comorbidity
      index (CCI), perioperative and postoperative vasopressor use, postoperative acute kidney
      injury network (AKIN), postoperative intensive care requirements, duration of hospital stay
      and 30-day mortality will be recorded.

      Blood will be taken and assessed from the participants preoperatively one day before surgery
      and creatinine, neutrophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil / lymphocyte values will be recorded.

      Though the gastrointestinal surgery team is the same, randomization will not be applied for
      the primary operating surgeon and primary surgeon selection will not be performed.
      Participants in both groups will have age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI),
      comorbidities, CCI, POSSUM physiologic score and ASA risk score recorded. After being taken
      to the operation room, standard monitoring (ECG, SO2, NIBP) will be performed. A peripheral
      venous route will be opened with an 18-gauge needle. Participants will be began 5 mL/kg/hr
      crystalloid (isolyte) infusion as standard. Later participants who accept will have an
      epidural catheter inserted at the thoracic 10-11 level. After ensuring hemodynamic
      stabilization in both groups, sedation will be provided with 0.03 mg/kg midazolam and
      arterial monitoring will be provided with radial artery cannulation with a 20-gauge
      peripheral cannula.

      Induction and General Anesthesia Management:

      For induction 1-2 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium will be used,
      and participants will be orotracheally intubated after two minute ventilation. A MAQUET
      flow-I anesthesia device will be placed in volume control (VC) mode by setting to 8 mL/kg
      tidal volume and 12/min respiratory count according to ideal body weight with PetCO2 35-45
      mmHg. Later, central venous catheterization will be performed on the right internal jugular
      vein using USG guidance. Sevoflurane (MAC 0.7-0.9) and remifentanil infusion (0.05-0.3
      mcg/kg/min) will be used in anesthesia maintenance.

      Monitoring:

      After radial artery and central jugular vein catheterization in Group G, they will be linked
      to an EV1000 Flo-trac monitor and monitoring provided continuous mean arterial pressure (MAP)
      monitoring with heart rate (HR), stroke volume variation (SVV), central venous pressure
      (CVP), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and cardiac index (CI) measured every
      minute. After monitoring blood gas will be taken and the initial value accepted as time-1
      (t1). At 5 minute intervals, mean arterial pressure (MAP), momentary heart rate (HR) will be
      recorded, with CVP, CI, SVV, and SVRI recorded at 30 minute intervals for a total of 240
      minutes (t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9), urine amount and blood gas values (pH, PCO2,
      PO2, bicarbonate (HCO3), base minus (BM), lactate (lac), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht))
      will also be recorded.

      In Group L, radial arterial cannulation and central jugular venous catheterization will be
      performed with the first value during monitoring accepted as t1. Then HR and MPA will be
      recorded at 5-minute intervals, CVP at 30 minute intervals for a total of 240 minutes (t1,
      t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9) and urine amount and blood gas values (pH, PCO2, PO2, HCO3,
      BM, lac, Hb, Ht) will also be recorded.

      Peroperative fluid management:

        1. Group G:

           Fluid management will be performed according to SVV and CI monitoring. When participants
           have SVV&gt;10%, 250 cc crystalloid will be administered and when SVV fell below 10% during
           30-minute monitoring standard (5 mL/kg/hr) crystalloid infusion continues. If SVV
           continues above 10%, a second fluid bolus of 250 cc colloid (minifluid challenge) will
           be administered. If the desired SVV level can not be reached, the Hct values will be
           examined. Blood replacement will be performed when Hct&lt;30% in participants with coronary
           artery disease (CAD) and when Hct&lt;25% for other groups. If the desired SVV level can not
           be reached in spite of blood replacement products, if CI will be below 2.5 L/min/m2
           vasopressor will begun. If SVV will be at normal values with CI below 2.5 L/min/m2,
           inotrop will begun.

        2. Group L:

      Fluid management will be performed according to MAP, HR and urine output. If peroperative
      urine amounts will be &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr during two-hour monitoring, with MAP&lt;65 mmHg, HR&gt;100/min
      for at least 30 minutes and CVP falls 20% compared to basal values, the same anesthesiologist
      will begin additional fluid replacement of 5 mL/kg/hr based on clinical experience. Blood
      product replacement will be provided at Hct&lt;30% for those with coronary artery disease and at
      Hct&lt;25% for other participants.

      The operation durations, administered fluid types, fluid amounts and blood product amounts
      will be recorded. Participants having intensive care need preoperatively planned intensive
      care will have planned admission, while participants developing hemodynamic instability
      linked to peroperative surgery or anesthesia will be admitted as unplanned care. All
      participants will have creatinine, neutrophil, lymphocyte and neutrophil/lymphocyte values
      recorded in the 1st and 24th hours postoperative and participants with fever (&gt;38 °C) in the
      1st day will be recorded. Acute kidney injury network (AKIN) classification will be made
      according to creatinine values measured preoperatively and on the postoperative 1st day. In
      the postoperative 30-day period, duration of hospital stay, surgical and pulmonary
      complications, inotrop or vasopressor requirements, reason for admission to intensive care,
      and duration of stay in intensive care if required will be recorded.
