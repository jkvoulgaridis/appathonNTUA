  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial to clarify if preoperative embolization of gastric
      arteries can reduce the incidence of oesophagogastric leakage after an esophagectomy for
      esophageal cancer comparing an experimental group vs control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with infracarinal esophageal carcinoma, the surgery is a complex procedure and
      with a high morbidity. It consists of a subtotal esophagectomy with tubular gastroplasty and
      cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. The most important complication is the anastomotic
      leakage with a high mortality. Among the possible causes of anastomotic leakage an important
      factor is the impaired microcirculation in the anastomotic region after the partial
      devascularization of the stomach during the surgery. There are several experimental studies
      about the different techniques to improve this vascularization and their effects on mucosal
      oxygenation. There are several methods currently used for assessing tissue oxygenation. The
      polarographic partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) electrode has been considered as the 'gold
      standard' for measuring oxygen tension. This is the reason why tissue pressure of oxygen
      (PtiO2) will be measured by Licox® (Integra Neuroscience) system in two groups. There aren't
      prospective randomized controlled trials to answer these questions. For this reason the
      investigators propose to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial in patients
      underwent on this surgery, comparing two groups: one of them will be carried out a
      preoperative arterial embolization (PAE), and the other one will be operated directly, to
      demonstrate if the ischemic conditioning by PAE can reduce the incidence of anastomotic
      esophagogastric leakage and improve the gastric conduit oxygenation.
