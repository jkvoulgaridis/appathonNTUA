  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will investigate the gut-microbiome and liver elasticity of the Biliary
      Atresia (BA)-patients before and after Kasai operation. The data will be analyzed according
      to their clinical outcomes including cholangitis to find out diagnostic makers, significantly
      associated with the BA-phenotypes. The decision-making tree for the BA will be updated with
      our data, which will strength the prognosis and prediction. The establishment of gut-liver
      axis, featured by cholangitis and gut-microbiome will open new pathway to treat the BA using
      fecal microbiota transplantation.

        1. Analysis of gut-microbiome: The investigator will investigate the alteration of
           gut-microbiome by restoration of bile flow at diagnosis, before and after Kasai
           procedure. In case of cholangitis after Kasai operation, signature gut-microbiome will
           be analyzed, which will lead to prevention of BA-patients from cholangitis via the
           bacteria transplantation.

        2. Analysis of elastography: In order to improve non-invasive diagnosis, The investigator
           will investigate the alteration of liver elasticity and hepatic blood flow before and
           after Kasai procedure as well as upon cholangitis and choledochal cyst. Those data will
           be analyzed in parallel with serum biochemical markers to be associated with
           pathophysiological events e.g., cholestasis, cholangitis and fibrosis.
