    <textblock>
      A Multicentre, controlled, randomized trial of 3 site (urethra, pharynx and rectum) sampling
      performed every 3 months (3x3) for Neisseria gonorrhoea (Ng)/Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct)
      screening (comparator) vs. no screening (intervention).

      This study is a multicentre, controlled, randomized trial of 3x3 Ng/Ct screening (comparator)
      vs. no screening (intervention). It will be performed in the PrEP cohorts situated at the
      Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Hôpital Saint-Pierre (HSP), Liège University Hospital
      (CHU), University Hospital of Gent (UZG) and Erasmus Hospital (EH). All men in follow up at
      these five centres who report having had sex with another man in the previous year and are
      enrolled for PrEP follow up will be eligible to participate in the study. After signing
      informed consent participants will be randomized via a computer-generated schema to either
      3x3 screening or no Ng/Ct screening. In both arms, participants will be followed up in an
      identical fashion including 3x3 screening. The only difference between the arms will be that
      in the screening arm, Ng/Ct results will be sent by the STI Laboratory to the study
      physicians and these participants will be treated and partner contact tracing will be done.
      The Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Laboratory will only process the samples/report the
      results from the non-screening arm at the end of the study. In both arms, all individuals
      with symptoms compatible with Ng or Ct will be tested and treated for these infections
      according to current best practice guidelines. At the end of the 12-month study period,
      participants whose most recent tests were positive for Ng or Ct will receive treatment for
      these.
