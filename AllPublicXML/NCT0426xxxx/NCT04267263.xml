  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether a primarily self-guided program can
      produce changes in weight, body fat and cardiovascular risk among young men.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This self-guided lifestyle intervention may help men to reduce weight and improve heart
      health because it has been adapted to meet the possible weight loss needs of young men. Young
      men may experience reductions in body weight after enrollment in the intervention, but this
      is unknown.

      Study participation lasts approximately 3 months. Participants will be assessed by the study
      staff and fill out questionnaires about current lifestyle practices (diet, physical activity,
      sleep habits, risk behaviors). Weight, medical events, and medication use within the last 3
      months will be assessed. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a
      coin) to the control group or self-guided group.

    <description>The intervention will consist of one 60-minute group based online session, adapted specifically for young men based previous work with young adults, followed by a self-guided program for 12-weeks. Participants will receive a tool kit that includes evidence-based resources (scale for self-weighing, handouts that will include free self-monitoring apps and strategies for no-cost exercise, sample meal plans and meal planning tips, and tips for healthy living that emphasize risk areas) to assist them during the self-guided phase, as well as weekly health risk text messages.</description>
