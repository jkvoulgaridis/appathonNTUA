    <textblock>
      Nucleix EpiCheck® tests analyzes the methylation pattern in a panel of DNA methylation
      biomarkers and determines whether this pattern is consistent with cancer under test or with
      non-cancer tissue.

      This study is being performed as part of the development process of the Pan Cancer EpiCheck
      test which includes the identification of different methylation profiles in various cancer
      types and healthy controls.

      The aim of this study is to characterize methylation patterns that will distinguish cancer
      from normal samples and will be able to recognize the origin of the cancer by collecting
      cfDNA (circulating free DNA) from blood samples collected from patients with a new diagnosis
      of cancer and from healthy volunteers who do not have diagnosis or history of cancer.
      Identifying those methylation patterns may assist in the development of blood test that will
      be able to detect the presence and the origin of wide range of human cancers

        The cases group will include subjects of at least 22 years old that were already diagnosed
        with cancer but did not yet undergo any surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or any other
        treatment for this cancer (i.e. treatment naïve subjects). Enrollment for this group will
        be stratified to enable representation of subjects with multiple tumor histological types,
        stage and grade.

        The control group will include healthy subjects, 45-80 years old. The subjects in the
        control group should be without any previous or current diagnosis of cancer except
        completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer.
