      This study will evaluate the impact of the Body Project (a dissonance-based program designed
      to address body image concerns and prevent eating disorders) on key eating disorder risk
      factors and relevant social and self-constructs at three time-points (pre, post, and one-year
      follow-up). Young women will be recruited from two high schools and will be randomized to
      receive the Body Project or to the control group. The Body Project will be facilitated by
      college-aged women.

      Preventive models that can avert the onset of eating disorders and innovative delivery
      methods that increase engagement with care offer a promising approach to improving the mental
      health and wellness of young women. This study aims to implement and evaluate the Body
      Project, a 4-hour dissonance-based program designed to address body image concerns and
      prevent eating disorders with high school young women using a peer delivery model. This study
      will evaluate the impact of the Body Project on key eating disorder risk factors and relevant
      social and self-constructs at three time-points (pre, post, and one-year follow-up). Young
      women will be recruited from two high schools and will be randomized to receive the Body
      Project program or to the control group. The Body Project will be facilitated by college-aged
      young women who have been trained to deliver the Body Project.
