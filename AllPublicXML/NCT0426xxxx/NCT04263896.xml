  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative constipation affects up to a third of women undergoing minimally invasive (MIS)
      gynecologic surgery and is a major source of anxiety and discomfort. The average time to
      first bowel movement after gynecologic surgery is about 2 to 4 days and some factors
      responsible for this include anesthesia inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility,
      opioid pain medication use, chronic NSAID use and anatomic manipulation.

      There are no established regimens to manage postoperative constipation after minimally
      invasive gynecologic surgery. Two studies evaluating the implementation of postoperative
      bowel regimen with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and with Senna and Docusate found no significant
      impact on postoperative bowel function. There have been no studies looking at the effect of
      preoperative bowel regimens on postoperative bowel function.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate postoperative bowel function after minimally
      invasive hysterectomy in women receiving a preoperative 10-day bowel regimen of PEG daily.

      Following enrollment subjects will be randomized into the intervention/treatment arm and
      control arm. All subjects will be asked to complete a baseline demographic form and three
      questionnaires (PAC-SYM, PAC- QOL, Wexner Constipation score). Additional demographic
      information will be obtained from chart review. This information will include past medical
      history, use of constipating medications, use of daily pain medications, chronic pain
      history, use of daily fiber supplementation.

      Subjects in the intervention arm will be given 10-day supply of Miralax and instructed on its
      use. They will take this medication for the 10 days prior to surgery. Subjects in the control
      arm will continue with standard care prior to surgery.

      Post operatively, all subjects will complete a diary for 7 days. In this diary they will
      record details about their bowel movements (time of movement, discomfort, texture of stool).
      They will also report average daily pain levels ( with a visual analog scale), daily pain
      medication use (time, medication, total number of pills).

      At the end of the 7th day all subjects will complete the same PAC questionnaires as they did
      pre-operatively.

    <measure>Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms questionnaire (PAC-SYM) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From 10 days pre-operation to 7 days post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>Constipation will be evaluated both preoperatively and postoperatively using a validated questionnaires (PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL). Patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) - The Patient Assessment of Constipation‐Symptoms (PAC‐SYM) questionnaire, developed through psychometric evaluation of adults with chronic constipation, is a tool for assessing the severity of patient‐reported symptoms of this disorder. The 12‐item questionnaire is divided into three symptom subscales: abdominal (four items); rectal (three items); and stool (five items). Items are scored on 5‐point Likert scales, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = 'symptom absent', 1 = 'mild', 2 = 'moderate', 3 = 'severe' and 4 = 'very severe'). A mean total score in the range of 0‐4 is generated by dividing the total score by the number of questions completed; the lower the total score, the lower the symptom burden.</description>

    <measure>Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From 10 days pre-operation to 7 days post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>Patient assessment of constipation quality of life (PAC-QOL) - PAC-Qol is a self-reported questionnaire, was used to measure the quality of life of patients.9 The validated PAC-QoL is composed of 28 items grouped into four subscales: physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, worries and concerns, and satisfaction. The first three subscales are used to assess the patient dissatisfaction index, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 96 (where lower scores correspond to better quality of life). The satisfaction subscale includes four items with a global score ranging from 0 to 16, so that each patient's self-reported definitive outcome is defined as either poor (0-4), fairly good (5-8), good (9-12), or excellent (13-16).</description>

    <time_frame>Day of surgery to 7 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale - The visual analog scale (VAS) is a measure of subjective pain intensity. It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal visual analog scale that is 100 mm in length. The subject will place a mark on the scale to indicate the intensity of her pain. 0 mm would be no pain, 100 mm would be the greatest imaginable pain. Any mark in between will be measured in mm to indicate degree of pain the subject is experiencing.</description>

    <measure>Wexner/ Constipation Scoring System/1996 Cleveland clinic score (CCS)/ Agachan Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Wexner a commonly used scoring system, is designed to assess the prevalence and severity of constipation. It is based on pathophysiological definition of constipation. The scoring system is based on eight variables (frequency of bowel movements; difficult or painful evacuation; completeness of evacuation; abdominal pain; time per attempt; type of assistance including laxatives; digitations or enemas; number of unsuccessful attempts at evacuation in a 24-h period and duration of constipation). The CSS consists of seven items that are scored using a five-point Likert scale that ranges from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time) and one item that is rated on a 0-2 scale. A total score can range from 0 (normal) to 30 (severe constipation). A cutoff score of 15 suggests constipation.</description>
