  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is enough evidence to suggest that the spinal manipulation of the upper cervical spine
      and cervicothoracic spine are effective in decreasing neck pain. Therefore, the purpose of
      this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of an isolated application of
      upper cervical spine thrust joint manipulation with the application of a full combination of
      cervical, cervico-thoracic and thoracic spine thrust joint manipulation on neck pain,
      disability and cervical range of motion in individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain.
