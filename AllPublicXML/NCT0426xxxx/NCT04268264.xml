    <textblock>
      This feasibility study tests if patients find incremental HD acceptable, whether they
      tolerate the treatment as planned and to evaluate its safety. Over a period of 18-months, 40
      participants will be recruited in to the study who are about to start HD therapy for ESRD.
      The participants will start HD incrementally (incremental HD group) reaching full dose HD
      over a period of approximately 15 weeks. The outcomes will be compared to a cohort of 40
      matched patients who previously started HD in the conventional manner (historical controls,
      conventional HD group).

      All patients will be followed-up for 12 months after first dialysis. Participants will be
      reviewed regularly during this time, and will undergo laboratory and bed-site monitoring
      tests. Acceptability and tolerance will be tested by documenting the numbers and percentages
      of patients who agree to participate and continue in the study. Patients who decline the
      invitation to join the study will be given the opportunity to express their reasons for
      declining to go on incremental HD (they will not play further part in the study). The safety
      of incremental HD will be tested by comparing the rates of pre-defined safety events in the
      incremental HD vs. conventional HD groups.

      The impact of incremental HD on patients' residual renal function will be monitored using
      serial 24-hour urine collections, bio-impedance testing will be conducted to estimate changes
      in fluid load, measurements of quality-of-life and functional status will be undertaken by
      using patient questionnaires and conducting six-minute walk tests respectively. These tests
      will be repeated at regular intervals. Blood tests for estimation of residual renal function
      and markers of renal anemia, bone disease and cardiac load will be performed at regular
      intervals and will be compared between the two groups (incremental HD vs. conventional HD
      groups). These measurements will help in the evaluation of impact of incremental HD on
      patients' health and well-being. The completion rates of these tests will provide important
      information about whether they should be included in a future larger trial of incremental HD.

      Data from this study will be used to test if it is feasible to use deaths (or a combination
      of deaths and cardiovascular events) as the main outcome measure in a future definitive trial
      on incremental HD. The data should enable a sample-size calculation for a future full-scale
      trial.
