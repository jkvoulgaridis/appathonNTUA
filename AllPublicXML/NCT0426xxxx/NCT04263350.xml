  <brief_title>A Study to Examine the Acceptable Taste and to Estimate the Amount of Atazanavir and Cobicistat in the Body When Taken as a Combination Product Versus When Taken as Separate Products at the Same Time</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Randomized Crossover Study to Obtain a Preliminary Estimate of the Bioavailability of Atazanavir and Cobicistat When Administered in an Age-appropriate Fixed-dose Combination Formulation Compared With Coadministration of the Age-appropriate Atazanavir and Cobicistat Individual Formulations and to Assess Preliminary Palatability/Acceptability in Healthy Adults</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atazanavir (ATV) and cobicistat (COBI) are approved for use with other drugs for the
      treatment of HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus Type 1) infection in adults. The positive
      effect of patients taking both these drugs led to the development of a combination tablet
      (EVOTAZÂ®), which can help reduce the number of pills a patient has to take and improves their
      adherence with HIV therapy. This study compares the amount of ATV and COBI in the bodies of
      healthy adult volunteers when taken as a combination formulation, and when ATV is
      administered as an oral powder at the same time as COBI administered as an oral tablet. The
      ATV/COBI combination formulation and ATV powder will be taken with food.

             (kg)/[height(m)]^2.

          -  Women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding and are not a woman of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) or who is a WOCBP and using a method of contraception defined in the

             treatment is administered.

          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks of study treatment administration.

             to cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vape pens, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine

             administration.
