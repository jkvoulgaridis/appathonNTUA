      Background: Several studies suggest an impact of physical exercise on walking parameters in
      Parkinson´s disease (PD) patients.

      Objective: the present study will evaluate the impact of three months physical exercise
      training program followed by a group-long walking on motor impairment in PD.

      Methods:

      PD patients will be randomized in two arms: one group will be assessed to a training exercise
      program of three months followed by long-walking in group under the support of
      physician/physiotherapist and caregivers. A complete motor, cognitive and general assessment
      will be performed at baseline. The patients will be evaluated under supervised an
      unsupervised conditions at baseline, before the long-walking, during the walking and after 2
      months after the walk.

    <description>A physical training will be started three months before the long-walking. The subjects will have to walk for at least 3 hours per week up to 6 hours per week during the training. THe long-distance capacity will be verified in 3 different one-day walking of 10, 15 and 18 Km before the long-walking performance.
The long-walking will be organized with the support of a physician, study nurse, physiotherapy with car support in case of need. The subject are request to complete the walk of 104 Km of Portuguese route of Santiago de Compostela walk.</description>
