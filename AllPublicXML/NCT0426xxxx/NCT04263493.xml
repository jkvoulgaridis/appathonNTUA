  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if delayed loading following surgical treated
      Achilles tendon rupture influence the clinical outcome and muscle and tendon structure after
      one year.

      The investigators hypothesize that delaying the gradual introduction of loading in the
      initial 26 weeks may reduce the heel-rise deficit (primary outcome) and thus improve the
      clinical outcome one year after surgery (primary endpoint).
