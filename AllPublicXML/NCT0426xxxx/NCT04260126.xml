  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VERSATILE-002 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of
      PDS0101 administered in combination with pembrolizumab in the first line treatment of adults
      with HPV16 and PD-L1 positive recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PDS0101 is a novel T-cell immunotherapy delivered subcutaneously that has been shown to
      stimulate high levels of HPV16-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells within patients by activating
      multiple immune pathways. These HPV-specific T cells then target tumors such as head and
      neck, anal and cervical cancers that are caused by HPV infection. The number of HNSCC cases
      has been increasing steadily over the last 10-15 years and over 90% of HPV-positive head and
      neck cancers are HPV16 positive. Pembrolizumab has been shown to have efficacy against both
      HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck cancers. However, its effectiveness is more
      optimal in tumors that are PD-L1 positive and have evidence of immune cells within the tumor.
      We hypothesize that increasing tumor-targeting HPV-specific T-cells with PDS0101 will be
      associated with an increased response to pembrolizumab. This study will explore in a
      preliminary manner whether combination treatment with PDS0101 plus pembrolizumab will improve
      clinical efficacy over that seen with pembrolizumab alone in the KEYNOTE-048 study.
