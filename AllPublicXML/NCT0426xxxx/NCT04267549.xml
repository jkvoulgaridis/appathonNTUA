  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of sintilimab
      (PD-1 inhibitor) , apatinib and chemotherapy in unresectable advanced gastric cancer patients
      with oligo metastasis. This study was designed as single arm with fixed number of
      participants.
