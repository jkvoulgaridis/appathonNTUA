  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effects of visual biofeedback, based on a sensorized system for
      the dynamic evaluation of the plantar pressure versus rehabilitation with traditional verbal
      instructions of the physiotherapist, on weight bearing distribution in patients who underwent
      first total hip replacement. The study is a randomized controlled trial, with parallel
      groups, without blinding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients, who underwent first total hip replacement surgery were enrolled and divided
      into two groups on second postoperative day. Experimental group followed the training wearing
      sensorized insoles that provided plantar pressures and shift of foot center of pressure
      images on three monitors. Control Group followed verbal instructions of physiotherapist
      during training. From 4th to 10th postoperative day both groups followed the same
      rehabilitation program including exercises to restore correct weight bearing.
