  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact etiology of preeclampsia remains unclear but is known to involve immunological
      factors. The thymus is one of the main organs involved in the development of the fetal immune
      system. The aim of this study was to explore the association between fetal thymus volume on
      ultrasound and preeclampsia by adding the 3-dimensional measurement of thymus volume to the
      routine fetal ultrasound scan at 11-14 week of gestation.

      Investigators performed a prospective clinical study in 100 pregnant women in their first
      trimester of pregnancy who attended the Fetal Medicine Unit of the Medicine Faculty of
      Karadeniz Technical University during the study period. Maternal age, gravida, para, BMI,
      blood pressure, gestational age, CRL and fetal timus volume measured with VOCAL programme are
      recorded. For all patients routine clinical and ultrasound examinations were performed during
      pregnancy. Gestational age at birth, way of birth and newborn birthweight were recorded. The
      results were statistically compared in the SPSS 13.0 program. Student-t test and chi-square
      test were used for statistical analysis. ROC curve analysis was used for limit values. The
      data of patients with preeclampsia and without preeclampsia were compared. The ability of the
      thymus volume to predict the preeclampsia was tested using binary logistic regression
      analysis. P value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
