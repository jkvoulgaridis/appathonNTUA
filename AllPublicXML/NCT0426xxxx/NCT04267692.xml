  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will compare participants who receive HaRTC versus the
      treatment-as-usual-only control arm to see if HaRTC helps SIHB patients who meet criteria for
      an alcohol use disorder to increase their engagement in cultural practices, enhance their
      quality of life, and reduce their alcohol-related harm above and beyond existing services at
      SIHB.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HaRTC refers to an alcohol treatment that integrates the traditional Native practice of
      talking circles with harm reduction, a low-barrier approach to substance-use treatment that
      does not require sobriety or use reduction. The HaRTC study is a 5-year collaboration between
      WSU, UW, and Seattle Indian Health Board (SIHB). It is funded by the National Institute on
      Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health. In this study, researchers
      from WSU and UW are working together with community members who have Native heritage and
      lived experience of alcohol problems as well as with traditional health professionals, staff
      and management at SIHB. As a team, the researchers will tailor, implement, and evaluate HaRTC
      as a culturally appropriate treatment for patients at SIHB who experience alcohol problems.

      This study is divided into three phases:

      Phase 1: During one-on-one interviews and focus groups, WSU and UW researchers asked
      patients, traditional healers, staff and management at SIHB how to best tailor HaRTC.

      Phase 2: The researchers assembled a community action board comprised of Native community
      members who have lived experience as well as traditional health professionals, staff and
      management at SIHB to refine the HaRTC treatment manual and procedures to best fit the needs,
      setting and values at SIHB based on their own lived experiences and on the findings from
      Phase 1.

      Phase 3: In the final phase of this larger 3-phase treatment development and evaluation
      project, the researchers will conduct a randomized clinical trial of the adapted Harm
      Reduction Talking Circles (HaRTC) program. Participants (N=280) in the RCT will report Native
      heritage, be at least 21 years of age, meet criteria for a current alcohol use disorder, and
      receive services at SIHB. Participants will provide informed consent and will be randomized
      (like flipping a coin) to receive either HaRTC or services as usual at SIHB so the
      investigators can evaluate whether HaRTC is a helpful addition to existing services.
      Participants will be asked questions about their involvement in cultural practices, alcohol
      use and quality of life prior to randomization, after the HaRTC ends, and at 1-, 3-, and
      6-month follow-up interviews. It is expected that HaRTC will help patients increase their
      engagement with cultural traditions, enhance their quality of life, and reduce their
      experience of alcohol-related harm. If so, the research team will work with SIHB to make this
      intervention sustainable for its community members.

    <description>Alcohol and Substance Use Frequency Assessment items were adapted from the Addiction Severity Index-Fifth Edition (ASI-5th Ed) and will be used to assess frequency of alcohol use in the past 30 days. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating more frequent drinking.</description>

    <description>The Alcohol Quantity and Use Assessment was created by the research team for previous studies with a similar population and will be used to record the quantity of alcohol consumed on participants' heaviest, typical, and lightest drinking days in the past month. Scores are expressed in number of standard drinks with higher numbers indicating heavier drinking.</description>

    <description>The Short Inventory of Problems-2nd Revision (SIP-2R), a psychometrically reliable and valid 15-item, Likert-scale questionnaire, measures social, occupational, and psychological problems related to alcohol use. Scores range from 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating more severe alcohol-related harm.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention, 3 months post intervention, and 6 months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL-5 Dimensional-5 Level is a widely used generic measure of health status consisting of two parts. The first part (the descriptive system) assesses health in five dimensions (MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT, ANXIETY / DEPRESSION), each of which has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to). Each domain is rated on a 5 point likert scale. Scores range from 5-25, with higher scores indicating poorer health related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention, 3 months post intervention, and 6 months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Scale solicits participants' subjective assessments of QoL across various domains, including material and physical well-being; relationships; social, community, and civic activities; personal development and fulfilment; and recreation. QOLS is reliable and valid across various patient groups and cultures, and is conceptually distinct from measures of HRQoL, such as EQ-5D-5L. QOLS scores range from 16 to 112, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Ethyl glucoronide</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention, 3 months post intervention, and 6 months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) urine tests will be used to validate self-reported alcohol use at each assessment. EtG, a metabolite of ethyl alcohol formed in the body after ethanol exposure, reflects alcohol consumption over the previous 72 hours. The EtG/creatine ratio will serve as a secondary outcome in analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cultural connectedness</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention, 3 months post intervention, and 6 months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Cultural Connectedness Scale is a 29-item Likert type measure consisting of 3 dimensions: identity, traditions, and spirituality. Scores can range from 29-145, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of cultural connectedness. Criterion validity was demonstrated with cultural connectedness dimensions adequately correlating with other indicators of wellness. The resulting scale scores will represent the proposed mediator in this study.</description>

    <description>HaRT-C participants will attend 8, adapted, low-barrier, weekly, closed-group Talking Circles, lasting approximately 2 hours each. During the adapted talking circles, the circle keeper will present the day's harm reduction topic, smudge the space, and allow participants to open themselves up to the circle. Topics presented by the Circle Keeper focus on harm-reduction and improving overall quality of health. Abstinence from alcohol use is not a requirement for the talking circles. As in the TAU arm, participants will continue to have access to treatment as usual at SIHB throughout the trial.</description>
