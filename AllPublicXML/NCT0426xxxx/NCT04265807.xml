  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), reperfusion injury can
      cause cell damage in the heart and brain. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) consists of
      intermittent application of a device such as a blood pressure cuff to a limb to induce
      non-lethal ischemia. Studies in animals with cardiac arrest as well as in humans with acute
      myocardial infarction suggest that RIC before or after restoration of blood flow may reduce
      injury to the heart and improve outcomes but this has not been proven in humans who have had
      OHCA. The RICE pilot study is a single-center study to assess the feasibility of application
      of RIC in the emergency department setting for patients transported to the hospital after
      resuscitation from OHCA.

    <time_frame>Discharge or 30 days after index arrest</time_frame>
    <description>These will be defined as any serious unexpected adverse effect on health or safety or any unexpected life-threatening problem caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect or problem was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation plan or application, or any other unexpected serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects. Death or neurological impairment will not be considered an adverse event in this study, as it is an expected part of the natural history of the illness for a large proportion of the population.</description>
