  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fn) has been identified as an independent
      risk factor for recurrence of colorectal cancer. In this study, oral metronidazole would be
      used to reduce the abundance of Fn in patients with high Fn, so as to explore whether oral
      metronidazole can improve the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with
      colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota are linked to chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Chemotherapy failure is
      the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Previously in
      the investigators' research, the investigators find the contribution of gut microbiota to
      chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. The investigators found that
      Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in patients with
      recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient clinicopathological
      characterisitcs. Furthermore, the investigators' bioinformatic and functional studies
      demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer resistance to chemotherapy.
      Metronidazole has been known to treat with anaerobe infection, including Fusobacterium. So
      oral metronidazole would be used to reduce the abundance of Fn in patients with high Fn, so
      as to explore whether oral metronidazole can improve the efficacy of postoperative
      chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer.
