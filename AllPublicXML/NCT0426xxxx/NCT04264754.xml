  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed as part of the development process of the Liver EpiCheck test
      which includes the identification of different methylation profiles in HCC (hepatocellular
      carcinoma) patients compare to cancer free control in blood samples
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study aimed to collect blood samples and
      de-identified clinical data from subjects diagnosed with HCC (cases arm) and subjects with
      high risk for HCC which are undergoing routine surveillance for HCC.

        Subjects who have already been diagnosed with liver cancer, however did not yet undergo any
        surgery, ablation, embolization or any other treatment for this cancerous lesion
        (including, but not limited to systemic therapies) will be enlisted into the study as the
        Case group.

        In addition, blood samples will be obtained from participants without cancer, who are
        considered in high risk for HCC; those subjects will be recruited from outpatient units or
        from Health Management Organization involved in routine surveillance for HCC in high risk
        subjects.
