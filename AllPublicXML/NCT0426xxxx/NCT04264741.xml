  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to treat opioid and
      methamphetamine addiction in previous studies, while no evidence was proved for patients
      methadone maintenance therapy with methamphetamine abuse. The aim of this study is to
      evaluating the effectiveness and safety of rTMS treatment for methamphetamine abuse in
      patients with methadone maintenance therapy.

      First, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized control study is going to be carried out. 100
      recruited patients will be randomized assigned to the intervention group and the control
      group, receiving either 4-week of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      treatment or 4-week of sham rTMS treatment. Both groups will receive 16-week urine drug test
      (1 time per week, 4 weeks before rTMS, 4 weeks during rTMS and 8 weeks after rTMS). Negative
      rate of urine test for methamphetamine is set as primary outcome. Cognitive function and
      craving are also evaluated before and after the intervention. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) is applied to investigate the potential neurobiological mechanism of rTMS
      treatment. This study will be very helpful to develop an evidence-based rTMS treatment
      protocols for methadone maintenance therapy with methamphetamine abuse and decrease risk of
      relapse for both the patients and their families.

    <description>The iTBS group received 900 pulses per day: 3-pulse 50-Hz bursts given every 200 ms (at 5 Hz), 2 s on and 8 s off for 5 min, at 100% resting motor threshold (rMT), over the left DLPFC (F3, EEG system) (4 weeks, 20 daily sessions). A figure-8-shaped Cool-B70 stimulation coil from MagPro X100 device (MagVenture, Farum, Denmark) was used for accurately targeted stimulation. Motor threshold was determined over the left motor cortex, by finding the lowest intensity that produced a motor response in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscles (APB), which produced five motor-evoked potentials responses of at least 50 mV in 10 trials.</description>
