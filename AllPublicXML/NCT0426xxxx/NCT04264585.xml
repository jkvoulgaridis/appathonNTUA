  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-secondary students are at an elevated risk for anxiety and depression, with
      approximately one in three students experiencing clinical levels of symptoms at some point
      during their academic career. Despite the high prevalence of these mental health concerns,
      many students do not receive adequate treatment. Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour
      therapy (ICBT) is an alternative to face-to-face service that is effective for improving
      symptoms of anxiety and depression in general adult populations. Recently, there has been
      increasing interest in the use of ICBT in post-secondary populations, however high drop-out
      rates and small effect sizes suggest that current ICBT programs are not fully meeting
      students' specific needs. Additional research is necessary to ensure that ICBT is delivered
      to students in a manner that is both acceptable and effective.

      The proposed study will be an implementation trial to examine whether the efficacy of an ICBT
      course for post-secondary students is improved by offering a motivational interviewing
      component at pre-treatment and a booster session 1-month after completing treatment.
      Follow-up assessment will be conducted as 3-month post-treatment. Primary outcomes are
      anxiety, depression, and academic functioning. Implementation outcomes will include measures
      of the acceptability, adoption, and fidelity (assessed by number of modules completed) of the
      ICBT course.

      The aims of the study will be to: assess the efficacy of the UniWellbeing Course in reducing
      symptoms of anxiety and depression and increasing adjustment to academic and social
      responsibilities; to assess the impact of a pre-treatment motivational interviewing component
      on attrition, engagement, and outcomes (depression, anxiety, and academic functioning); to
      assess the impact of a booster session on anxiety, depression, and academic and social
      adjustment at three-month follow-up; and to assess the combined effect of including both a
      motivational interviewing component and booster session on outcomes.

    <description>The CQ is a self-report measure that focuses on three factors of change: importance, ability, and commitment. For the purpose of this study, the desired change will be to &quot;reduce the anxiety and/or depression I experience&quot;. For each of the three factors, participants are asked to rate on a scale of 0 (&quot;Definitely not&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Definitely&quot;) how motivated they are to make the change. Total scores on the questionnaire can range from 0 to 30.</description>

    <description>All clients will receive the same materials, namely the UniWellbeing Course, which was developed at Macquarie University, Australia. The UniWellbeing Course is a transdiagnostic intervention targeting symptoms of depression and anxiety, that has been tailored for use in post-secondary students. It comprises 4 online lessons that provide psychoeducation about: symptom identification and the cognitive behavioural model; thought monitoring and challenging; de-arousal strategies and pleasant activity scheduling; graduated exposure; and relapse prevention. Seven supplementary lessons can also be accessed at any time (e.g., sleep, communication). Materials are presented in a didactic (i.e., text-based with visual images) and case-enhanced learning format (i.e., educational stories demonstrate the application of skills) with 4 lesson summaries and homework assignments that facilitate skill acquisition. Therapists will spend ~15 mins. per week/per client.</description>
