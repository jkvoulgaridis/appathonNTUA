  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose for this protocol is to perform an open-label human clinical pilot study on the
      effects of consumption of two nutraceutical blends in subjects with long-term unexplained
      fatigue interfering with daily living.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label human clinical study to evaluate the effects of consumption of the
      nutraceutical product ATP-Fuel, compared to the nutraceutical product ATP-II. The study
      participants will be randomized to one of three groups: consuming ATP-Fuel (5 capsules, twice
      daily); consuming ATP-II (3 capsules, once daily); or consuming ATP-II (3 capsules, twice
      daily). The study is of 8 weeks' duration, with evaluation at baseline, 1, 4, and 8 weeks of
      product consumption.

      At each visit the following measurements and procedures are performed: Blood pressure,
      questionnaires pertaining to fatigue, pain and wellness, and a blood draw. The blood is used
      for testing of lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial volume and metabolic activity.
