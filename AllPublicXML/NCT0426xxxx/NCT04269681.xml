  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial in which the main objective is to compare High Flow Nasal Cannula
      (HFNC) versus the standard respiratory care in the alleviation of dyspnea perception in
      patients with do-not-intubate (DNI) order. This is a pragmatic study that will take place in
      10 Brazilians ICU facilities which are already participating in the main study RENOVATE
      NCT03643939.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Do-not-intubate (DNI) is usually established in cases where endotracheal intubation (ETI) is
      considered disproportionate to prognosis and/or incompatible with the expression of wishes
      and values of the patient. Regardless of the profile of this care plan offered to patients
      with DNI, the control of dyspnea is one of its central objectives. The approach to dyspnea
      includes pharmacological measures such as opioids and non-pharmacological measures, such as
      oxygen therapy and Non-Invasive Ventilation, and more recently, the high flow nasal catheter
      (HFNC). HFNC provides high flow of heated and humidified mixed gas through a nasal cannula.
      In addition to the ability to generate high flows and supplemental oxygen, HFNC may generate
      a low level of positive airway pressure, may decrease dead space ventilation and may
      contribute to better patient comfort, such as the possibility of oral feeding while
      undergoing treatment, performing oral hygiene and allowing conversation and interaction with
      family members. This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy of HFNC in reducing dyspnea
      and improving comfort in patients with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) and DNI order.

    <intervention_name>High Flow Nasal Cannula</intervention_name>
    <description>Experimental intervention (HFNC) The HFNC (AIRVO 2 - Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) consists of a device that allows FiO2 adjustable from 21 to 100% and that delivers a flow of humidified and heated gas up to 60 l / min and 37 degrees C of temperature.
The HFNC will be offered until resolution of the ARF or until decision by the assisting team and the patient and/or their legal guardian, for the suspension of the treatment due to intolerance, and/or worsening of the discomfort and / or dyspnea.
The HFNC should be offered to the patient in ARF as follows:
Initial parameters: Flow 45 ml / L, FiO2 50%, AIRVO 37oC temperature;
Titrate the flow up to 60ml / L or up to the maximum tolerated;
Titrate FiO2 to maintain SatO2 between 92% to 98%, starting with 50%;
Keep the AIRVO temperature at 37oC, if not possible, acceptable down to 34oC.</description>

    <description>The patient randomized to standard respiratory support will be placed on conventional low flow oxygen therapy according to the center's standard of care aiming at SpO2 90 - 98% and improvement of dyspnea. For cases refractory to oxygen therapy, keeping SpO2 below 90% or if dyspnea does not improve, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be offered at the discretion of the assistant team. NIPPV will be performed with the patient in a supine position at 45 degrees. The mask will be facial (oronasal or full face) with an appropriate size for each patient and adapted in a way to minimize leakage. A hydrocolloid dressing can be placed over the nose in order to avoid ulcerations and increase comfort. The NIPPV will be performed with the help of a ventilator with inspiratory and expiratory circuits or with Bilevel devices with a single circuit and exhalation valve according to the availability of each center.</description>
