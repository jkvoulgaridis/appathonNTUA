      The investigators aim to assess the safety and efficacy of nebulized liposomal amphotericin B
      (ALN) as a complementary therapy to the usual systemic treatment in patients with invasive
      pulmonary aspergillosis and the utility of a non-routine test as a surrogate marker of
      efficacy. To this end, a 3-year phase I, prospective, randomized and controlled clinical
      trial will be carried out in a single center, in patients with proven or probable pulmonary
      aspergillosis receiving routine systemic treatment. Participants will be randomized ( 1: 1)
      to receive ALN, 25 mg or nebulizer injection water 3 times a week, for 6 weeks. The primary
      objective is the safety of ALN in this scenario, including clinical tolerance and
      pharmacokinetic studies. Secondary objectives are presented as: a) clinical efficacy, using
      the following criteria: complete response, partial response, stability and progression or
      death, on week 12; b) microbiological efficacy, using culture, galactomannan, BDGlucan and
      Aspergillus PCR in induced sputum on week +6; and c) to explore the utility of the SUV
      (&quot;standardized uptake value&quot;) index in PET-CT performed on week +6 in relation to a baseline
      PET-CT as a surrogate marker of response. The administration of ALN and placebo will be
      carried out by eFlowR vibrating membrane electronic nebulizers. To carry out the study, the
      following visits will be made: baseline, week 1,2,3,4,5,6 (efficacy and safety evaluation), 9
      and 12 (overall evaluation).

      Phase of the clinical trial Phase I trial (pilot study), prospective, randomised, controlled
      trial using a drug under conditions of use not approved for the form of administration.

      It is a Phase I study since the primary objective includes tolerance analysis, safety and
      pharmacokinetic and distribution studies of nebulized amphotericin, but when administered to
      patients it also carries out the preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of the
      treatment.

      Primary and secondary variables

      Primary variable:

      Reduction of &gt;20% of post-nebulized FVC and FEV1 in relation to values obtained before
      nebulization.

      In each visit made during the nebulized therapy period (week 1 visit in view of week 6) the
      following parameters will be objectified: before and after nebulization:

        -  forced vital capacity (FVC)

        -  forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1) Both parameters will be measured with the
           Micro Spirometer; Micro Medical Ltd; Rochester UK). Repeat 3 times and obtain the higher
           value

      Secondary variables:

        -  Related to tolerability and safety

        -  At systemic level: Fr Resp/min: Breathing rate per minute, Fr Card/min: Heart rate per
           minute, BP (mmHg): Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Sat 02 (%): Percentage of
           oxygen saturation (digital pulse oximetry), blood test disturbances.

        -  At the pulmonary level: symptomatic cough, bronchospasm (auscultation), dyspnea or
           shortness of breath, need for bronchodilator treatment.

        -  Others: bad taste in mouth, nausea, dysphagia Given the practical absence of systemic
           passage of nebulized Ambisome confirmed in other studies, the practical absence of
           reported systemic reactions and given the high number of systemic events that these
           patients develop in relation to their underlying pathology and the use of other systemic
           treatments, adverse events of an extrapulmonary or systemic nature that are not
           considered adverse reactions (related to nebulized therapy, the object of the study)
           will not be collected for the study.

        -  related to pharmacokinetics

        -  Concentration of amphotericin in bronchoalveolar lavage

        -  Plasma amphotericin concentration Related to Effectiveness

        -  Radiological efficacy (including PET-CT control): Image response and PET-CT performance:
           Quantification of SUV metabolic uptake index in a combined positron emission tomography
           (PET-CT).

        -  Microbiological efficacy in BAL: Microbiological response in bronchoalveolar lavage
           (BAL): Comparison of results of calcofluor staining, fungal culture, galactomannan,
           BDGlucan and Aspergillus PCR of BAL samples obtained by fibrobronchoscopy

        -  Serum microbiological response: Comparison of results for galactomannan and BDGlucan in
           serum during the weeks of study follow-up

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Those over 18 years of age, signed by the IC or its representative, with a compatible
             respiratory clinic and meeting the following criteria will be included in the study:
             aspergillosis confirmed in sterile sample culture (e.g. lung biopsy) or with
             histological evidence of invasion, regardless of the patient's condition (proven
             aspergillosis).

          -  In the absence of proven aspergillosis, patients who meet all 3 conditions below are
             considered likely and also eligible for inclusion:

               -  Clinical criteria: neutropenia (&lt;500 neutrophils /ul), haematological malignancy,
                  haematopoietic parent transplantation, solid organ transplantation, prolonged use
                  of steroids, solid tumour, HIV infection, systemic diseases requiring
                  immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis,
                  malnutrition, post-operative cardiac surgery or respiratory distress secondary to
                  influenza;

               -  Radiological criteria (TAC): infiltrates with halo effect, aerial meniscus,

               -  Microbiological criterion: isolation of Aspergillus spp in respiratory samples
                  (whether or not associated with hyphae vision in staining techniques) or the
                  positivity of galactomannan in serum (&gt;0.5 x2 or &gt;0.8 x1) or galactomannan in BAL
