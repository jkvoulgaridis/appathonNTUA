  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants and young children up to 10 years of age with a complex condition involving the
      gastrointestinal tract are at risk of poor nutritional status, including faltering growth.
      Due to the complex condition, standard nutrition is often not tolerated and causes
      gastrointestinal symptoms.

      Formulas in which protein is replaced by its smallest elements, amino acids are easier for
      the body to digest and absorb. These formulas might be tolerated better and reduce
      gastrointestinal symptoms in infants and young children with complex conditions.

      The objectives of the present, exploratory study are to gain clinical evidence related to the
      nutritional status and gastrointestinal tolerance in infants and young children with complex
      conditions receiving Neocate as their primary source of nutrition. Additional objectives are
      to describe the nutritional and pharmacological management of these infants and young
      children. Study duration for each participant will be 52 weeks at maximum.
