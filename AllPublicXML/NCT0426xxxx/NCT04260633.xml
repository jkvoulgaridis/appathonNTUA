  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to help improve individualization and optimization of clear aligner therapy
      through the use of new technologies in orthodontics. The study will compare 12-hour and
      22-hour tray wear time and evaluate the adjunctive use of Vpro+. The study clinicians will
      use Dental Monitoring to monitor study participants throughout the trial and will use the
      Dental Monitoring system to instruct patients to continue or stay on their clear aligners.
      The outcome of the study will be the time it takes to complete 10 trays.

    <description>The current standard of care for clear aligner use as suggested by Invisalign is unclear as to how frequently aligners should be changed. We suspect that the frequency for aligner change as determined by the orthodontist using Dental Monitoring will be variable for every participant.
Vpro+ is an adjunctive therapeutic tool for clear aligner treatment. It is proposed to deliver high frequency vibrations to reduce treatment time and pain associated with clear aligners.
Align Technology suggests 22-hour wear time for clear aligner therapy. Participants in two arms of the study will be asked to wear the trays for about half the recommended wear time to assess whether night-time aligner wear will be sufficient for successful treatment.</description>
