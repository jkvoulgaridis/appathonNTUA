      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone after
      chemotherapy work in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer that is sensitive to
      androgen deprivation therapy (castration sensitive) and has spread to other parts of the body
      (metastatic). Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy
      using apalutamide may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor
      cells. Antihormone therapy, such as abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of
      testosterone made by the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as prednisone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Apalutamide, abiraterone acetate, and
      prednisone after chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with castration sensitive
      prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Efficacy of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate + prednisone following
      docetaxel with ongoing androgen deprivation therapy in men with high risk metastatic
      castration sensitive disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate +
      prednisone following docetaxel with ongoing androgen deprivation therapy.

      II. Time to event. III. Rate of conversion from AR-V7 negative to positive. IV. Depth of
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) response.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quality of life. II. Falls.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD), abiraterone acetate PO QD, and
      prednisone PO QD. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive androgen deprivation therapy per standard of
      care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 10
      years.

                  required. Subjects may be on one of these at the time of consent, but it must be
                  stopped prior to day 1 of study treatment. These drugs are frequently used in the
                  newly diagnosed metastatic setting to blunt the effect of the testosterone spike

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to apalutamide or other agents used in the study

                  meningioma, or other benign central nervous system [CNS] or meningeal disease

               -  Severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive heart
                  failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50%, arterial or venous
                  thromboembolic events (e.g. pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident

                  a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate
                  dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g.,
                  from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day).

               -  Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with CYP2D6 substrates that have a
                  narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, exercise
                  caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate

               -  Baseline moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B &amp; C)

          -  Inability to stop a prohibited medication:
