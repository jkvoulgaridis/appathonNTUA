      The study was a randomized controlled training intervention study in the pre-test and
      post-test order. The population of the study consisted of nulliparous pregnant women who
      applied to the Konya Dr. Ali Kemal Belviranlı Maternity and Children Hospital Pregnancy
      School and met the criteria for inclusion in the study at time of the study. Sample size was
      calculated with G * Power 3.0.10 program with an effect size of 0.3 (medium effect level) and
      a power of 80%. A total of 180 pregnant women were identified as 90 in the intervention group
      and 90 in the control group. Considering that data will be lost due to reasons such as
      discontinuation and exclusion criteria during pregnancy 10% more of the determined number was
      included in the study and the sample size was calculated as 198 pregnant women and 252
      pregnant women were reached during the study. 36 pregnant women in the intervention group and
      35 pregnant women in the control group were excluded from the study for different reasons and
      the study was completed with 181 pregnant women (90: control: 91). The groups were determined
      by randomization. During the conduct of the study, all pregnant women who applied to the
      pregnant school and met the criteria for participation in the study were recorded in the
      pre-training registry and numbered in the order of registration. Every week because of
      differences in the number of pregnant women who attended the school participating women were
      divided into two groups using a random number table created in the program via the computer
      itself. The purpose of the study was explained to pregnant women, informed consent form and
      data collection tools of the study were collected by face to face interview technique. In the
      first interview to all pregnant women; Personal Information Form, Course Information Form,
      Pittshburg Sleep Quality Index (PUKI) and General Self-Efficacy Scale were applied. Pregnant
      women in the intervention group were given a two-session training program to improve sleep
      quality and &quot;Sleep Guide&quot; and &quot;Safe Baby Sleep Conditions Brochure&quot;. Pregnant women in the
      control group were subjected to routine practice without any training given by the
      researcher. Four weeks after the completion of the sleep training, all pregnant women were
      contacted by telephone and the data collection tools were applied for the second time and the
      final test applications were completed. After completion of the data collection process made
      a new plan for training to improve the quality of sleep to pregnant women in the control
      group and the &quot;Sleep Guide&quot; and &quot;Safe Baby Sleep Conditions Brochure&quot; is given.

    <description>Pittshburg Sleep Quality Index (PUKI):
PUKI is a self-report scale that evaluates sleep quality and disorders in the past month.
It consists of 24 questions in total, 19 of which are self-report based questions.
The last 5 questions are not included in the scoring, they are used for clinical evaluation.
Each item of the scale is evaluated as 0-3 points.
Seven &quot;component&quot; scores are created from nineteen items. While some components consist of evaluating a single substance, some components are the result of combining several items.
Components that make up the scale; subjective sleep quality, sleep delay, sleep duration, habitual sleep effectiveness, sleep disorders, use of sleeping pills and daytime dysfunction.
The scale total score is obtained by calculating the points of these seven components and the maximum scale score that can be obtained is 21.
Increased score indicates poor sleep quality.
A total scale score of 5 and above is expressed as bad sleep.</description>
