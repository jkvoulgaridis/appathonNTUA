  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current international guidelines recommend a three-month blanking period after pulmonary vein
      isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF). Early recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia
      (ERAT; comprising of AF, left atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter) is common, occurring in
      up to 65% of patients, but in the first month is generally thought not to predict long-term
      AF recurrence, and re-intervention is not recommended. Suggested causes for ERAT include
      inflammation and arrhythmogenic structural changes caused by ablation lesions. Early, purely
      inflammatory ERAT would not lead to late AF recurrence as pulmonary vein reconnection is
      established as the main factor associated with long-term recurrence in paroxysmal AF.
      Previous studies have shown ERAT in the second to third month (rather than first month) to be
      a stronger predictor of late AF recurrence, due to presumed reduction in the contribution of
      the acute inflammatory response after this. Biochemical data have shown that the
      post-ablation inflammatory phase is usually limited to the first month after both
      radiofrequency (RF) and cryoballoon (CB) ablation, though inflammatory markers have been
      shown to be less elevated following CB PVI. Histologically, lesions formed by the two
      modalities differ significantly. RF lesions are characterised by irregular boundaries and
      significant disruption to the endothelium, exposing the sub-endothelial layer and resulting
      in significant and sustained platelet activation, changes which can last for many months. CB
      lesions on the other hand, are observed as well demarcated and homogenous within one week,
      with reduced thrombogenicity, which may lead to reduced inflammation. ERAT following CB
      ablation cannot be accurately predicted by inflammatory response and it is postulated that
      endothelial function may play a role in the development of ERAT in such patients. Some
      studies have shown reduced recurrence rate and re-hospitalisation amongst the CB population,
      including the FIRE and ICE trial, potentially resulting in a better patient experience with
      CB and the possibility of a shorter blanking period. Post-ablation inflammatory response is
      more predictive of ERAT following RF than CB PVI, and the latter is considered to be
      associated with less inflammation. There is however, a paucity of data evaluating endothelial
      function post-AF ablation and its correlation with ERAT or late recurrences of arrhythmia.
      Given that earlier re-intervention in patients with ERAT in the third month of the blanking
      period can result in greater outcomes with respect to late recurrence of AF, if it can be
      demonstrated that endothelial function testing in the first few months post-CB PVI can be
      predictive of later ERAT, then shortening the blanking period following CB PVI and performing
      repeat ablation to control troublesome later ERAT may reduce overall patient morbidity and
      re-hospitalisation.

      The purpose of this novel pilot study is to examine the relationship between the
      post-ablation inflammatory response, endothelial function and timing and frequency of ERAT
      for patients undergoing RF and CB PVI for paroxysmal or short-lived persistent (less than 6
      months' duration) AF. If the initial data provides hypothesis generating information, the aim
      would be to perform the study on a larger basis with higher statistical power to determine
      whether early post-ablation endothelial function testing can predict recurrences and identify
      those suitable for earlier re-intervention.
