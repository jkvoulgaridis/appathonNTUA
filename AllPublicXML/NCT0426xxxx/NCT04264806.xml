      The purpose of the study is to compare overall response rate (ORR) between treatment groups
      in participants with higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Chronic Myelomonocytic
      Leukemia (CMML) who are not eligible for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT).

      Cusatuzumab (also known as JNJ-74494550 and ARGX-110) is a humanized monoclonal antibody of
      camelid origin that binds with high affinity to human Cluster of Differentiation 70 (CD70).
      Azacitidine (an Hypomethylating agent [HMA]) is approved for the treatment of higher-risk MDS
      in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). Both approvals are based on data
      showing decreased transfusion burden, delayed progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      improved quality of life, and extended survival. It is hypothesized that the addition of
      cusatuzumab to azacitidine will result in an improvement in overall response rate (ORR)
      compared with azacitidine alone in participants with higher-risk MDS or CMML.

    <description>FACT-An is a scale in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Measurement System. It consists of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (general version; FACT-G) and 20 questions labeled &quot;additional concerns&quot; that measure anemia/fatigue. FACT-G is 27-item compilation of general questions divided into 4 primary quality of life domains: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional wellbeing, and functional well-being. Participants will be asked to rate scale items as it applies to past 7 days, on 5-point scale (0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Somewhat, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much). Negatively stated items will be reversed by subtracting the response from 4. After reversing the proper items, items are summed to a total to generate a score on (sub)scale. A summary Trial Outcome Index total score (FACT An TOI) will be calculated by summing physical well being, functional well being, and anemia symptoms subscales and higher is the score better is the quality of life.</description>
