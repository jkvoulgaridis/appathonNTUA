    <textblock>
      It is a phase 1, open-label, single-center, three-part study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of CC-99677 administered alone or in
      combination with either methotrexate and sulfasalazine; itraconazole, rifampin, midazolam, or
      a cocktail of digoxin, metformin, and rosuvastatin in healthy subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow investigation of potential drug-drug interaction mediated through
      cytochrome P450 enzymes and drug transporter proteins. During each part, blood samples will
      be collected at prespecified times for pharmacokinetic assessments. Subject safety will be
      monitored throughout the study. There will be approximately 16 subjects enrolled into each
      part.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Subject is in good health, as determined by the Investigator based on a physical
             examination at screening.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) are not permitted in Part 1, but are
             permitted in Parts 2 and 3, and must:

               1. Have two (2) negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to
                  the first dose of IP. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the
                  course of the study, and prior to discharge from the study site. This applies
                  even if the subject practices true abstinence2 from heterosexual contact.

               2. Agree to use, and be able to comply with, one highly effective3 non-hormonal
                  method of contraception without interruption, during the study (including any
                  dose interruptions), and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of IP. The
                  female subject's chosen form of highly effective contraception must be effective
                  by the time the female subject is enrolled into the study (eg, contraception
                  should be initiated at least 28 days prior to enrollment) and at least 28 days
                  after discontinuation of IP.

             prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Female subjects are prohibited from participating in Part 1. Female subjects may
             participate in Parts 2-3.

          5. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

             positive result to the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at
             screening.

             a. Note: Subjects who received hepatitis B vaccination and who test positive for
             hepatitis B surface antibody and negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and
             hepatitis B core antibody remain eligible for study participation.
