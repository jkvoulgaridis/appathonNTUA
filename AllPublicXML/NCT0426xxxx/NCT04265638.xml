  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of cancer face a future of persistent medical
      issues across a wide spectrum of diseases One study examining health data from this cohort
      (ages 15-29) reported significantly higher rates of smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease,
      hypertension, asthma, and poorer mental health among the cancer survivors when compared to
      healthy controls. Prescribed exercise has broad and far-reaching beneficial physiological
      effects that cut across multiple body systems and consistently improves emotional well-being,
      decreases fatigue and depression, and enhances quality of life. Although a growing body of
      evidence consistently demonstrates the physiological and psychological benefits of exercise
      interventions in adults with cancer, there are no studies examining the effects of
      individualized, prescribed, supervised exercise in pediatric, adolescent and young adult
      cancer survivors.

This motor-area composite measures control and coordination of the large musculature that aids in posture and balance. Scores are assessed to determine stability dynamically and statically, on one leg and utilizing both legs, on a balance beam when the eyes are open for more than 10 seconds and if the patient can likely do so when the eyes are closed for about 5 to 10 seconds and also a twenty-four foot straight line.</description>

    <measure>Change of Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 6, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Piper Fatigue Scale: Fatigue will be measured using the Piper Fatigue Inventory, which evaluates total cancer-related fatigue, as well as subscales of fatigue such as affective, behavior, cognitive, mood, and sensory. There are 4 individual subscales comprise 22 items with the average score representing total fatigue. The subscales are behavioral/severity (6 items), affective meaning (5 items), sensory (5 items) and cognitive/mood (6 items). Standardized alpha for the entire scale (n = 22 items) is 0.97, indicating that some redundancy still may exist among the items. The scale ranges from 0 to 10. A score of 0 indicates that the participant shows no signs of fatigue; a score from 1 to 3 indicates mild fatigue, 4-6 indicates moderate fatigue and a score greater than 7 indicates severe fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Measure health-related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 12 and 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0): The PedsQL is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The PedsQL integrates generic core scales and disease-specific modules into one measurement system. The 23-item PedsQL generic core scales and disease-specific scales were designed to measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning. This measure is tailored to 5 different age groups: however, we will only use the section designed for teens (13-18) which is made up of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions. Ferrans &amp; Powers Quality of Life Index: Total quality of life will be measured using the Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index Version III and is a 66-question index designed to evaluate social, psychological, family, and health satisfaction. This assessment is valid for ages 18 and up.</description>

    <measure>Healthy Days Core Module (CDC HRQOL-4</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 6, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HRQOL is a 4-question assessment of overall health, both physical and mental health. The questionnaire is scored as follows: First unhealthy days are calculated as an estimate of the overall number of days during the previous 30 days when the respondent felt that either his or her physical or mental health was not good. The score for obtaining unhealthy days is done by combining the responses to questions 2 and 3 to calculate a summary index of overall unhealthy days, with a logical maximum of 30 unhealthy days.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, weeks 6, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): The VAS is a validated pain measurement for individuals age seven and older. The scale is a single line with one end denoting no pain and the other, the worst pain possible. The scale was validated in 1976 with a reliability score of 0.94. The VAS is a scale of 100-mm and ratings of 0 to 4 mm can be considered no pain; 5 to 44 mm, mild pain; 45 to 74 mm, moderate pain; and 75 to 100 mm, severe pain81</description>
