  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label investigator initiated Phase Ib study of combination pembrolizumab
      (Keytruda), 200mg IV 3 weekly (Q3W) with 50mg oral cyclophosphamide daily (OD) in metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma patients. 21 patients will be recruited within the United Kingdom (UK)
      will to examine the efficacy of the combination for up to 35 administrations (2 years). This
      study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all relevant
      regulations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAPER Trial will be looking at patients with locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma who have had previous treatment with immunotherapy and have
      experienced disease progression. Immunotherapies aim to boost the body's natural defences to
      fight cancer, however the tumour micro-environment may significantly impact how effective
      this approach will be at reducing cancer growth and spread. The CAPER trial aims to evaluate
      whether oral metronomic cyclophosphamide (50mg once daily) can alter the tumour environment
      and ultimately lead to responses to pembrolizumab in patients who have failed prior
      immunotherapy.

      Patients who join the study will initially take cyclophosphamide 50mg tablets once a day for
      21 days during the 'run-in period'. Following this, they will continue with cyclophosphamide
      50mg daily alongside intravenous pembrolizumab treatment administered once every 3 weeks.
      Patients will continue both treatments until the occurrence of either disease progression,
      unexpected toxicity, patient withdrawal, or completion of 24 months of treatment.

      Patients will undergo CT scanning to evaluate response every 9 weeks during trial treatment.

      Research biopsies will be taken at baseline (prior to treatment), after the 21 day run-in
      period on oral cyclophosphamide, and at the time of the first CT scan (week 9 on treatment).
      Patients will also have additional research blood samples collected at serial timepoints
      whilst on treatment. The biopsy and blood samples will allow evaluation of the changes
      induced by cyclophosphamide and pembrolizumab within the tumour microenvironment as well as
      changes in circulating factors such as cytokines.

             care and trial treatments).

          2. High burden / symptomatic disease which in the opinion of the treating investigator

          5. Prior intolerance to IO therapy (any &gt; Grade 2 toxicity which required permanent IO
             treatment discontinuation).

          6. Ongoing Adverse Events (AEs) due to previous therapies or surgery which have not

          7. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          8. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy (in
             dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisolone equivalent) or any other form of

             recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not
             have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation
             (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS (Central Nervous System) disease.

             pneumonitis.

         15. Active infection requiring systemic therapy or has had requirement for antibiotics
             within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.

         16. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Note: no testing for HIV is

             or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA positive) infection. Note: no
             testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required.

         18. Known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis, TB). Note: no testing for
             TB is required.

         19. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         20. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial.

         21. Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Note: WOCBP must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to trial entry (see Appendix 3). If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required. In the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test
             and the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be
             performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study
             medication.
