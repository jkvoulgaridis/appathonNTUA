    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and
      biomarkers of RO7198457 plus atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone in patients with
      Stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
      positive following surgical resection and have received standard-of-care adjuvant
      platinum-doublet chemotherapy.
