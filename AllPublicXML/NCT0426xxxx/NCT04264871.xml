  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with sickle cell disease systematically receive a transfusion 2 to 5 days before
      scheduled surgery (with the exception of minor surgeries) in order to avoid post-operative
      complications of which the vaso-occlusive crisis and acute thoracic syndrome are the most
      frequent.

      This standardized preoperative protocol was established on the basis of the results of
      large-scale randomized studies, most of which date back over ten years, and which have
      demonstrated the beneficial effects of transfusion (or transfusion exchange) preoperatively.
      To date, several other more recent studies (but not controlled) have questioned this type of
      systematic management.

      The purpose of this study is to review retrospectively data of sickle cell children who have
      undergone elective surgery at the Huderf in the last ten years and to identify the eventual
      complications encountered. The most common procedures in these patients are: tonsillectomy
      with or without associated adenoids, splenectomy and cholecystectomy.

      General data on sickle cell disease (history, genotype, G6PD deficiency, biology and previous
      complications), pre-surgical preparation, surgery and post surgical management and
      complications will be collected and analyzed.

      This retrospective analysis will allow an objective assessment of the current quality of care
      and will provide useful data to improve patient management.
