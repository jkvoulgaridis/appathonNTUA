  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop systems are becoming an integral part of diabetes management. These systems were
      uniformly proven to improve glycemic control, reduce hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia while
      modestly reducing HbA1c levels and improving quality of life. While overnight control is
      close to optimal under closed loop control, postprandial hyperglycemia during daytime remains
      a challenge. The advanced hybrid closed loop system was designed with an improved auto-basal
      control and additional auto-bolus module that delivers correction boluses automatically. In
      addition, this system was developed to improve user experience by significantly reducing the
      amount of alarms and exits from Auto Mode. Therefore, this system might have an advance in
      treating hyperglycemia over the hybrid closed loop that controls glucose levels by modulation
      of insulin basal rate only. Therefore, we propose the current study that will compare 6 weeks
      glycemic control using hybrid closed loop versus advanced hybrid closed loop that add
      correction boluses among young children and adolescents.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of 6 weeks
      glucose control using Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL-670G) compared to Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop
      System (AHCL- 670G) in young subjects with sub-optimally controlled type 1 diabetes. A total
      of 28 subjects (age 6-14 years) will be enrolled at two investigational centers.
