    <textblock>
      Introduction: Regular exercise training improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery
      disease (CAD). This study investigates whether the beneficial effects of exercise can be
      partly explained by favourable changes in haemostasis and inflammation.

      Methods: 150 CAD patients are randomised to a supervised long-term exercise program (3
      months) or usual care. Blood samples are obtained at baseline, 1.5 months, and 3 months after
      randomisation.

      Results: The investigators will evaluate platelet turnover and aggregation, coagulation,
      fibrinolysis, and inflammatory markers before and after short- and long-term exercise, and
      the two randomised groups will be compared.

      Perspectives: The present study will increase our knowledge of the beneficial mechanisms
      underlying the effect of exercise in CAD patients, potentially paving the way for improved
      exercise recommendations.
