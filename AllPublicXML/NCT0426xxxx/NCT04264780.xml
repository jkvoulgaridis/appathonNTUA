  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will give important information about long term consequences of temporal lobe
      epilepsy surgery on cognition (memory, language, concentration etc), psychiatric function and
      quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients in Norway who have undergone temporal lobe epilepsy surgery ten years ago or
      more, will be invited to participate. Two groups will be compared: patients who are younger
      than 50 years of age vs patients who are older than 50 years of age.

      The aim of the study is to improve preoperative information to future epilepsy surgery
      patients, to aid medical personnel (doctors, psychologists) in the selection of patients for
      surgery, and to improve knowledge of need for long term follow-up and rehabilitation.

    <time_frame>During single data collection session, aproximately 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Memory will be measured by Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, results reported as raw scores from 1-worst to 15-best; and Diagnosticum für Cerebralschädugung-Revised - DCS-R, results reported as raw scores from 1-worst to 15-best. All results will be converted to T-scores with average 50, standard deviation 10.</description>

    <time_frame>During single data collection session, aproximately 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Language will be measured by the subtest &quot;Similarities&quot; from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - WAIS-III, results reported as raw scores from 1-worst to 33-best; Boston Naming Test-results reported as raw scores from 1-worst to 60-best; Letter Fluency from Delis Kaplan Executive Function Scale-D-KEFS, raw scores from 1-worst and up.

    <description>Visuospatial abilities will be measured by the subtest &quot;Block Design&quot; from WAIS-III, raw scores from 1-worst to 68-best. Results will be converted to T-scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in each study group on neuropsychological tests of executive function from baseline (preoperative) to current evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>During single data collection session, aproximately 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be measured by the subtest &quot;Digit Span&quot; from WAIS-III, raw scores from 1-worst, to 30-best; Trails A and B from Halstead test battery, raw scores from 1-worst and up. All results will be converted to T-scores.</description>
