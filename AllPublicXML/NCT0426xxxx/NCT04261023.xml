    <textblock>
      Phase II, single-centre, open label, two parallel arm cohort randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) testing abatacept in a population of anti-CCP Ab positive individuals at moderate to
      high risk of developing IA according to a published risk score, already followed in the
      observational study 'CCP: Next Generation'

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is now evidence that the immunological disease process starts many years before the
      onset of clinically detectable inflammatory arthritis (IA). It is now a realistic goal to
      treat individuals in this pre-clinical phase with the possibility of arresting their
      progression to clinical disease.

      Individuals at risk of developing RA can be identified by the presence of CCP antibodies
      alongside other clinical features. In Leeds we have developed a prediction model that
      stratifies these individuals into at-risk vs. low risk. At present there are no treatments in
      this pathway until individuals develop IA.

      T-cells appear to be an appropriate target in at-risk individuals as they play a critical
      role in the generation and maintenance of autoimmunity. Abatacept (Orencia) is a selective
      T‑cell modulator that blocks a co-stimulatory signal needed to activate T‑cells and has an
      excellent safety profile.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant in Leeds CCP 'Next Generation' observational cohort who has tested
             positive for anti-CCP Ab and accepted to be approached for a interventional study

          -  Age &gt;18 years old.

          -  At moderate to high risk of progression to IA (see below).

          -  Consents to be contacted in future for an interventional study

        A prediction model will be used to risk stratify individuals based on the following
        predictors:

          1. Tenderness of ≥1 small joint of the hands or feet defined by the physician (one point)

          2. Early morning stiffness ≥30 minutes (one point)

          3. RF and/or anti-CCP Ab concentration &gt;3x upper limit of normal. (2 points) The
             participant's risk will be calculated according to the model suggested by Rakieh et
             al. (1). Those with a score of ≥3 out of 4 will be eligible to be randomised.

               -  For the intervention arm:

                    -  Randomised to intervention arm

                    -  Consents to commence Abatacept therapy (if not, will remain in CCP
                       Next-generation study)

               -  For the control arm:

                    -  Randomised to the control arm

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For both the intervention and control arms:

          -  Previous diagnosis of RA or other form of inflammatory arthritis including, but not

             arthropathy and including current treatment with DMARDs or biological therapy

          -  Clinical synovitis on clinical examination by a rheumatologist

          -  Presence of concomitant illness likely to require systemic glucocorticosteroid therapy

             therapy.

          -  Women in the intervention arm who get pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from
