  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RADIAL is an algorithm which has been developed following a review of the literature on 67
      autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) and personal clinical experience. Frequency and
      specificity of each feature were defined for each autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, and
      corresponding prediction scores were assigned. Clinical and paraclinical features of patients
      are entered into the algorithm, and a patient's total score for each ARCA is calculated,
      producing a ranking of possible diagnoses. Sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were
      assessed by blinded analysis of a multinational cohort of 834 patients with molecularly
      confirmed autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. The performance of the algorithm was
      assessed versus a blinded panel of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia experts. The correct
      diagnosis was ranked within the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses at a sensitivity and
      specificity of &gt;90% for 84% and 91% of the evaluated genes, respectively. Mean sensitivity
      and specificity of the top 3 highest-scoring diagnoses were 92% and 95%, respectively. Our
      aim is now to validate in a prospective cohort of ARCA, the performance of RADIAL to predict
      the correct genetic diagnosis.

    <description>Randomization is a methodological refinement that is only useful for this secondary endpoint (does not relate to the primary endpoint). The clinical and paraclinical data of all patients will be treated in the same way, and randomization concerns only the use of RADIAL made by the data biologist in sample processing. There is therefore no randomization of subjects but only of genetic results.
At the genetic study stage (Panel PMDA panel), for the patient group randomized &quot;with RADIAL results&quot;, the interpretation of genetic data (and in particular of the different variants found) will be done aware of the results given by RADIAL, and in the randomized group &quot;without results RADIAL &quot;, the analysis of the genetic data will be done in the absence of knowledge of the results provided by RADIAL.</description>

    <description>The analysis of phenotypic data in RADIAL and the analysis of DNA (analysis of the Friedreich gene ± PMDA panel) will be performed for all patients in order to meet the main objective and the secondary objectives.
Specifically for the secondary objectives (N ° 3, 4 and 5), randomization via eCRF (electronic case report form) will be performed for the interpretation of genetic analyzes (PMDA panel) without inducing any change for the patients. This randomization, by block and by center, will allow the attribution of one of the following two groups:
Control group: interpretation of genetic analyzes without the use of RADIAL;
Experimental group: interpretation of genetic analyzes using RADIAL. Exome analysis (secondary objective n ° 6) will be carried out for all the patients who remained without diagnosis at the end of the first part, and for whom the DNA of relatives is available.</description>
