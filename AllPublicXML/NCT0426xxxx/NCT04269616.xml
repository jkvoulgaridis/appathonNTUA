  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women recruited from the internet were put in a hypothetical situation of being in labor at
      22 weeks of pregnancy, and presented with information in the form of pictographs about
      survival and disability of babies born at this gestational age.

      Participants were randomized to receive these pictographs in a different order (survival or
      disability first) and to receive descriptiveness level of survival (just numerical
      information, or also description of course of NICU stay).

      Participants were then asked to choose between comfort care and intensive care in this
      situation. Participants' religiosity, value of the sanctity of life, and health literacy were
      also assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Workshop on Periviable
      Birth recommended that information on the chance of survival and risk of disability should be
      provided separately. The order in which information is presented can affect memory,
      persuasiveness, and treatment choice, but the effect of order of information presentation in
      the context of neonatal resuscitation has received little attention. Additionally, the effect
      of including a description of the long and intense time in the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) on parental treatment decision making is also unexplored. Current evidence suggests
      that pictographs best convey numerical information to parents.

      Three pictographs were developed based on NICHD data for 22 weeks gestational age (GA) babies
      who received intensive care. One pictograph displayed information on the rates of disability
      in the babies who survive. Two pictographs displayed information about how many babies born
      at 22 weeks survive, with one of these pictographs including a description of the average
      course of NICU stay.

      An internet survey was sent to a U.S. representative sample of women of child-bearing age. A
      vignette including background on prematurity and the treatment options of intensive care or
      comfort care for a baby born at 22 weeks GA was presented. Participants viewed the
      pictographs, evenly randomized to one of four experimental conditions (order of information
      presentation x level of description of NICU course). Participants were then asked to choose
      intensive care or comfort care. Participant religiosity, values (quality vs. sanctity of
      life), autonomy preferences in medical decision making, previous NICU exposure, numeracy, and
      health literacy were also assessed.

    <time_frame>Assessed immediately post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's hypothetical treatment choice of either comfort care or intensive care. Participants were told: &quot;Your doctor asks you what treatment option you want to choose,&quot; and given the options of &quot;I would want the doctors to provide the baby intensive care / comfort care.&quot; This dichotomous variable is assessed for the frequency of each option chosen.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Religiosity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed post-intervention, immediately after treatment choice.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' religiosity was assessed using the Duke University Religion Index (5-item). Potential scores range from 5-27, with 27 being the most religious.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference for medical autonomy</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed post-intervention, immediately after treatment choice.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked on a 4-point scale their medical autonomy preferences, in the form of: &quot;In making medical decisions: 1) I always prefer to have the doctor make decisions for me, 2) I would prefer to have the doctor make medical decisions for me most of the time, 3) I would prefer to make my own medical decisions most of the time, or 4) I always prefer to make my own decisions.&quot; Score ranging from 1-4, with 4 being the maximum preference for medical autonomy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Values: quality or sanctity of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed post-intervention, immediately after treatment choice.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants answered the following: &quot;In making end-of-life decisions: 1) Quality of life is much more important than preserving life, 2) Quality of life is somewhat more important than preserving life, 3) Preserving life is somewhat more important than quality of life, or 4) Preserving life is much more important than quality of life.&quot; In the range of 1-4, a score of 4 indicated the greatest participant value of sanctity of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed post-intervention, immediately after treatment choice.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' numeracy levels were assessed by using an adapted item from the Subjective Numeracy Scale: &quot;How good are you at figuring out how much a $20 shirt will cost if it is 25% off? Extremely / Quite a bit / Somewhat / A little bit / Not at all.&quot; Participants who answered somewhat, a little bit, or not at all were considered to have low numeracy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed post-intervention, immediately after treatment choice.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' health literacy was assessed using the single-item Brief Health Literacy screening, which asks, &quot;How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself? Extremely / Quite a bit / Somewhat / A little bit / Not at all.&quot; Participants who answered somewhat, a little bit, or not at all were considered to have low health literacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Previous NICU exposure</measure>

    <description>Participants were also asked if they have previously had a child in the NICU, with yes/no answer options.</description>
