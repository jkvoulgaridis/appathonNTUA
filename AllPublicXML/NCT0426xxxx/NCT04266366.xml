    <textblock>
      Perform a cost-utility analysis in patients with chronic low back pain through
      electroanalgesia treatment and exercises administered by telemedicine program versus
      face-to-face program
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blind clinical trial will be developed in a sample of 80 subjects with chronic low
      back pain. Patients will receive 3 weekly sessions of electroanalgesia and an exercise
      program for 8 weeks, for a total of 24 sessions. The aim is to analyze the cost-
      effectiveness of a face-to- face rehabilitation program vs a telemedicine program on
      disability, pain, fear of movement, quality of life, resistance of the trunk flexors, lumbar
      mobility in flexion and muscular electrical activity.

    <description>It consists in a support system for the treatment of chronic low back pain based on web technologies. The system can register a subject and provide a treatment of electroanalgesia and exercise through the Mckenzie method. Video applications of electroanalgesia and exercises will be shown to patients who use their computer or mobile device to access the platform through the Internet. The treatments will be recommended by the system based on the database that is configured to accommodate the application of electroanalgesia and McKenzie exercises based on the diagnosis according to the McKenzie method.patients will perform the treatment 3 times per week, for 8 weeks, with a total of 24 sessions</description>

    <description>In each hospital, two trained therapists will carry out a face-to-face rehabilitation program consisting of electroanalgesia and an exercise program that follows the Mckenzie method. The physiotherapists place the electrodes in the patients, for this they use 5x9 cm electrodes, which they place at the bilateral paravertebral level, in the patients who present with radicular pain, the electrodes will be placed in the path of the affected nerve. The duration will be sufficient to carry out the Mckenzie protocol. Mckenzie exercises are designed to make changes in the internal periarticular components of the spine.</description>

    <description>It consists in an e-Health rehabilitation program through a web platform performing electroanalgesia and an exercise program following the Mckenzie method. Patients will be instructed in the use of the TENS device using 5x9cm electrodes at the bilateral paravertebral level, the patients that present radicular pain, the electrodes will be placed in the path of the affected nerve. The realization of exercises will be through the application of an Mckezie protocol. The duration will be the same as that used to carry out the Mckenzie protocol. Mckenzie exercises are designed to make changes in the internal components periarticular of the spine.</description>
