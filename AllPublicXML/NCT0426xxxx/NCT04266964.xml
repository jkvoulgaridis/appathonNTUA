  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to verify validity and reliability of the Muscle excitability scale
      (MES), which has been developed to access muscle susceptibility to spasms and/or clones as
      part of spastic motor behavior in spinal cord injured patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The muscle excitability scale (MES) is intended for patients after spinal cord injury. The
      objective is to evaluate a motor response (muscle spasms or clones) to a sensory or motor
      stimulus. A sensory stimulus is created by thumb and pointfinger compression of cutaneous
      tissue on the inside part of the middle thigh and calf. A motor stimulus is created by
      passive movement of the lower limb to flexion and extension. The MES grades from 0 to 4
      reflect the muscle spastic or clonic tendency and the extent of this motor response (from
      isolated to generalized). Two investigators will examine a spastic motor behavior in 50
      chronic SCI subjects using MES, Modificated Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Penn Spasms Frequency
      Scale (PSFS) to verify the validity and reliability of the MES.

    <description>With the patient in a supine position, squeeze the skinfold between your thumb and pointfinger on the inner aspect of the middle third of the thigh and on the inner aspect of the middle third of the calf.
Place your hand under the proximal calf and the heel and move the leg into maximum flexion at the hip and knee joints. After the response, if any, is completed, move the limb back into full extension. Each of these movements lasts for one second.</description>
