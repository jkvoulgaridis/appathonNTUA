  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS), to test a set of hypotheses about the role of the
      prefrontal cortex in behavioral and neural correlates of cognition in schizophrenia.
      Behavioral, electrophysiological (EEG) and neuroimaging measures will be used to assess
      cognitive performance. This study has three main goals: (1) To compare the effects of
      task-engaged versus resting tDCS in order to optimize the impact of tDCS on goal maintenance
      related neural oscillatory activity and task performance in schizophrenia; (2) To establish
      the regional specificity of the impact of DLPFC tDCS (compared to Occipital tDCS) effects on
      brain circuitry underlying goal maintenance in schizophrenia; (3) To examine relationships
      between tDCS effects on DLPFC GABA levels, DLPFC-related oscillatory activity and cognitive
      performance in schizophrenia. This study is solely intended as basic research in order to
      understand brain function in healthy individuals and individuals with schizophrenia. This
      study is not intended to diagnose, cure or treat schizophrenia or any other disease.

    <description>In tDCS, saline-soaked electrodes are temporary affixed to the scalp and connected to a battery-powered current generator. A weak (2 mA) constant current is then briefly applied (~20 minutes) to stimulate the targeted brain area (e.g. the DLPFC). To control for placebo effects, the study will utilize a sham stimulation protocol that consists of very brief constant stimulation (~1 minute). Subjects usually cannot discern the difference between the sham and experimental stimulation protocols due to habituation.</description>
