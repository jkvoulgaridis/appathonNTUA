  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to describe
      the efficacy of R-CHOP plus copanlisib including a safety run-in phase in order to detect
      early and common unexpected toxicities caused by the addition of copanlisib to the standard
      immuno-chemotherapy R-CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with DLBCL can be cured with a combined approach of CHOP chemotherapy and
      the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in roughly 65% of cases. About one third of patients with
      DLBCL relapse or show primary progressive disease after modern first-line therapy. The
      outcome of these patients is poor in particular if first-line therapy contained rituximab.
      Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently warranted. Thus, it is the goal to further improve
      progression-free Survival (PFS) and overall Survival (OS) by combining R-CHOP with
      copanlisib. Copanlisib is a small molecule pan-class 1 PI3K inhibitor and approved by US FDA
      for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at
      least two prior systemic therapies.

    <description>All patients will receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP immunochemotherapy every two weeks with the following doses per cycle: rituximab 375 mg/m², cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m², doxorubicin 50 mg/ m², vincristine 1.4 mg/m² (dose capped at 2 mg or 1 mg for individuals above 60 years of age), prednisolone 500 mg. In addition, copanlisib at a dose of 60 mg will be administered on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle of R-CHOP in the first 6 patients. If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in no more than one out of these 6 patients during cycle 1, additional 6 patients at 60 mg will be enrolled and treated for at least 1 cycle before opening the phase II portion of the study. If a DLT is observed in 2 or more of the first 6 patients during cycle 1 the dose of copanlisib will be reduced to 45 mg on days 1 and 8 for the next 6 patients. The data of the safety run-in analysis (first 12 patients) will be presented to the Data Safety Monitoring Board and the recommended phase 2 dose will be determined.</description>

               4. Follicular lymphoma Grade 3B (primary diagnosis without history of indolent
                  lymphoma) with a diagnostic biopsy performed within 3 months before study entry
                  and with material available for central review and complimentary scientific
                  analyses

          2. 18-80 years of age

          3. International Prognostic Index (IPI) 2-5

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status (ECOG) 0-2

          5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          6. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception when
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed
             consent form and 6 months after the last administration of study treatment. A woman is
             considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until
             becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods
             include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral
             oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for continuous 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level
             in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women
             not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. The investigator or
             a designated associate is requested to advise the patient how to achieve highly
             effective birth control (failure rate of less than 1%), e.g. intrauterine device,
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner
             and sexual abstinence. The use of condoms by male patients is required unless the
             female partner is permanently sterile.

             Adequate baseline laboratory values collected no more than 7 days before starting
             study treatment:

          7. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (&lt; 3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert syndrome, patients
             with cholestasis due to compressive adenopathies of the hepatic hilum or documented
             liver involvement or with biliary obstruction due to lymphoma)

          8. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x
             ULN for patients with liver involvement by lymphoma)

          9. Lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN

             Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. If not on target, this
             evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the
             CKD-EPI formula or by 24-hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable
             range, it may be used to fulfill the inclusion criteria instead.

         11. INR and PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN
