      Investigators will test the superiority of Superiority Trial of Fluticasone-Vilanterol as
      needed in mild asthma compared to standard of care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      single centre randomised control trial with the aim of comparing the superiority of
      effectiveness and safety of fluticasone-vilanterol versus usual care. In this study there is
      random allocation of participants to usual care (Any ICS or SABA combination) or
      fluticasone-vilanterol as required for the relief of symptoms.

    <ipd_description>Study documents (paper and electronic) will be retained in a secure (kept locked when not in use) location during and after the trial has finished. All essential documents including source documents will be retained for a period of 3 years after study completion (last patient, last visit). A label stating the date after which the documents can be destroyed will be placed on the inside front cover of the case notes of trial participants.Monitoring, audits, and REC review will be permitted and provide direct access to source data and documents. The Lead PI and the researcher assigned by her will have access to the stored data. Only the CRCs and Lead PI working on this study will be eligible to obtain the data from the participants during data collection visits.</ipd_description>
