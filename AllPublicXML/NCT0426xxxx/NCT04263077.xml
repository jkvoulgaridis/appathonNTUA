  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kinesiotape technique applied in
      different tensions on pain tolerance (PT) of healthy university students. 100 healthy and
      volunteer male individuals studying at Mugla Sitki Kocman University Faculty of Health
      Sciences will participate in the research. Study protocol was approved by the ethics
      committee of Mugla Sitki Kocman University. The study is designed as a randomized,
      controlled, double-blind study to be performed on 4 groups consisting of 25 individuals in
      each group (No tension(Placebo), and 50%, 75%, 100% tensions of Kinesiotape). Kinesiotape
      will be applied over lateral epicondyle of the dominant extremities with diamond shape
      technique by a KTAI®certified physiotherapist. PT's will be measured with J-Tech algometer
      before, immediately and 30 minutes after taping by a different physiotherapist who will be
      blind to taping tension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diamond shape banding method will be applied in a way that 4 bands of 2.5 cm width cut
      kinesio tape ends on top of each other, leaving the lateral epicondyle region exposed while
      the elbows are slightly flexed in the supine position. In the groups where different tensions
      will be applied, the middle points of the tapes will be stretched according to the amount of
      tensions, and the ends will be taped over each other without tension.In the placebo group,
      the tapes of the tapes will be applied tensionlessly without overlapping each other.
      Algometer will be used in the assessment of pressure pain threshold and pain tolerance. Pain
      severity felt at the level of pain threshold and pain tolerance will be evaluated with the
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All measurements will be made before taping, immediately after
      taping and 30 minutes after taping, will be repeated 3 times and their average values will be
      recorded. There will be a 60 second rest period between each trial to avoid temporal
      sensitization. Each assessment will be performed bilaterally by another physiotherapist who
      is blind to the band tension and has no experience with the kinesio banding technique.

    <description>Study will be performed with 4 groups of 25 individuals, each of whom use the kinesiotape at different tensions. 0% tension application will be for Placebo, 50% tension application, 75% tension application 100% tension application. In groups with different tension banding, pressure pain threshold will be measured with algometer bilaterally. Measurements will be repeated 3 times and their average will be recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity felt at the level of pain threshold and pain tolerance will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) bilaterally. The pain intensity created by the algometer probe end will be measured by VAS. The patients will mark the severity of their pain on a 100 mm line, one end of which is painless and the other end expressing unbearably severe pain. Values close to 0 mean that the pain is less, and values close to 100 indicate that the pain is high.The VAS assessment will be done immediately after each pressure pain threshold and pain tolerance measurements. Measurements will be repeated 3 times and their average will be recorded.</description>
