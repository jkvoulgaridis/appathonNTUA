      This is a phase 4 open-label study aiming to explore the relationship between clinical
      response to erenumab and genetic biomarkers.

      Subjects with episodic or chronic migraine will be treated with Erenumab 70mg or 140mg for a
      4-week baseline/screening period, followed by a 24-week treatment period.

      Subjects will collect migraine-related parameters daily using an eDiary and blood samples
      will be collected for biomarker research. All analysis will be descriptive in nature.

          -  History of migraine (with or without aura) for greater than or equal to 12 months
             before screening according to the International Headache Society (IHS) Classification
             ICHD-3 (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society, 2018)
             based on medical records and/or patient self report

          -  Greater than or equal to 4 headache days that meet criteria as migraine days per month
             on average across the 3 months before screening After baseline period

             baseline period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

             behaviour

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease
             (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere
             with the study evaluation, procedures or completion Prior/Concomitant Therapy

          -  Previously received erenumab (Aimovig®)

          -  Received an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody within 3 months prior to the start of the
             baseline period Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience

          -  Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less
             than 30 days or 5 half-lives since ending treatment on another investigational device
             or drug study (ies). Other investigational procedures while participating in this
             study are excluded.

        Other Exclusions

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test assessed at
             screening or day 1 by a urine pregnancy test.

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or
             breastfeed during treatment and for an additional 16 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential unwilling to use 1 acceptable method of
             effective contraception during treatment and for an additional 16 weeks after the last
             dose of investigational product. Refer to Section 11.5 for additional contraceptive
             information.

          -  Evidence of current pregnancy or breastfeeding per subject self-report or medical
             records

             during dosing.

          -  Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or
             procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures (e.g, Clinical Outcome
             Assessments) to the best of the subject and investigator's knowledge.
