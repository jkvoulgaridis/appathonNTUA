  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic management has long been identified as a key factor affecting burn prognosis.
      However, large amounts of crystalloid infusion have been associated with the development or
      aggravation of organ failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, vascular injury, acute
      renal failure, and intra-abdominal hypertension) which worsens the final prognosis.

      The use of albumin during the first 24 hours of burn resuscitation is controversial since
      capillary leakage may cause transcapillary passage of large molecules into the interstitial
      space. In fact, human albumin has multiple physiological effects, including regulation of
      colloidal osmotic pressure, antioxidant properties, nitric oxide modulation and buffering
      capacities, plasma binding and transport of various substances, which may be particularly
      important in severe burns.

      Currently available data suggest that administration of exogenous albumin during the first 24
      hours of resuscitation of severe burn patients may be associated with improved outcomes.
      Multi-centre randomized controlled trials with adequate power should be undertaken in burned
      patients.

      In the participating centers: severe burn adult patients with a TBSA burn &gt;30% will be
      included and followed for 90 days after admission. This observational study will allow us to
      collect and analyze data in order to design a quality interventional trial evaluating the
      value of albumin in the initial management of the severely burned patient.

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the incidence of a combined endpoint of
      mortality, severe acute renal failure (stage 3) and severe acute respiratory distress
      syndrome in severely burned patients.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Describe the prognosis of patients with severe burns, with particular emphasis on the
           impact of albumin on the prognosis of patients with severe burns.

        2. Describe how albumin is administered (i.e. doses, duration of treatment, continuous vs.
           bolus administration, hyperoncotic vs. hypooncotic solutions, etc.).

        it is a population of adults burned to more than 30% of total skin surface. In fact, beyond
        this surface, the investigators expect to observe a large volume of perfused crystalloid
        and potentially an incidence of the primary endpoint of around 40%. These are the people
        who could potentially benefit the most from albumin therapy.
