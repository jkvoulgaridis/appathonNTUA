      The study compared the effect of bitter melon intake and moderate exercise on postprandial
      glucose levels as measured by incremental area under the curve (iAUC) in eight patients with
      type 2 diabetes.

      Background: This study compared the effects of bitter melon intake and moderate-intensity
      physical activity on postprandial glucose responses in type 2 diabetic patients.

      Methods: A total of 8 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to two sequences
      (AB, BA) with two treatments (A or B) using a 2 x 2 randomized cross-over design: A) 100 ml
      of bitter melon juice administered 15 minutes prior to the 75-g oral glucose load; B) 30
      minutes walking at moderate-intensity performed 15 minutes after the oral glucose load.

    <description>The participants were asked to consume 100 ml of bitter melon juice 15 minutes prior to the 75-g oral glucose intake. Participants drank the juice within 5 minutes. Participants remained seated throughout the following 2 hours.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants performed 30 minutes of treadmill walking at 65% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. The exercise started 15 minutes after the 75-g oral glucose intake.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bitter melon juice (100 ml)</intervention_name>
    <description>Fresh bitter melon fruits were purchased from certified local groceries. The seeds of bitter melon were removed, and the juice was obtained from the raw fruit using a blender. Every 140 g of bitter melon fruit produced approximately 100 ml bitter melon juice.</description>

    <intervention_name>Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The walking exercise was started 15 minutes after the glucose load. Walking speed was determined to elicit 65% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax) during exercise for each participant. HRmax was estimated using the America College of Cardiology prediction model, HRmax=208 − 0.7 × age. All participants wore a heart rate monitor (Polar, Vantage, XL) around the chest to assess exercise intensity. A rate of perceived exertion was assessed every 2 minutes based on the Borg's scale.</description>
