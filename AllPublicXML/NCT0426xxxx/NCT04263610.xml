  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Tildrakizumab
      in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis participants who are non-responder to Dimethyl
      fumarate (DMF) at Week 16. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 will include the first 16
      weeks of the Treatment Period and Part 2 will include the last 24 weeks of the Treatment
      Period.

    <time_frame>Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and scaling on a scale range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked), together with the percentage (%) of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (the most severe disease). PASI 75 response, is defined as having an improvement (reduction) of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 75% in PASI score compared to the baseline score.</description>

    <description>BSA is a numerical score used to measure the total area of the body affected by psoriasis. The palm method will be applied: the participant's palm, including the five digits is used as a reference (representing approximately 1% of the total body surface area) and is used to repeatedly cover the lesions on the body. The investigator totals the number of palms required and then estimates the percentage (%) in each of the four body regions: head (including scalp) and neck (10%); upper extremities (20%); trunk (30%); and lower extremities (40%).</description>

The DLQI score is the sum of the 10 individual question scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The DLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30.</description>

    <description>Skindex is the dermatological instruments to measure dermatology-specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The 16-item Skindex questionnaire is divided into three domains: questions related to the participant's symptoms (1-4), emotions (5-11), and functioning (12-16). Each question asks the participant to quantify how much a specific aspect of their skin condition bothered them in the week prior to administration of the Skindex-16. The questions are answered on a scale from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered) with a total possible score ranging from 0 (best HRQoL) to 96 (worst HRQoL). Each item is then transformed to a linear scale from 0 to 100.</description>

Each item is scored from 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The DLQI score is the sum of the 10 individual question scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The DLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30. Baseline value is defined as values collected at Week 1 of Part 1 of the study.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Percent Change from Baseline in Absolute Skindex-16 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 32 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>Skindex is the dermatological instruments to measure dermatology-specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The 16-item Skindex questionnaire is divided into three domains: questions related to the participant's symptoms (1-4), emotions (5-11), and functioning (12-16). Each question asks the participant to quantify how much a specific aspect of their skin condition bothered them in the week prior to administration of the Skindex-16. The questions are answered on a scale from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered) with a total possible score ranging from 0 (best HRQoL) to 96 (worst HRQoL). Each item is then transformed to a linear scale from 0 to 100. Baseline value is defined as values collected at Week 1 of Part 1 of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>DMF: Baseline, Weeks 24, 36 and 40, Tildrakizumab: Baseline, Weeks 20, 32 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>The pruritus-VAS is used to assess the pruritus by ticking the scale, which describes pruritus the best. The pruritus-VAS is a single-item continuous scale comprised of a 10 centimeter (cm) [(100 millimeter (mm)] horizontal/vertical line anchored by two verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pruritus intensity, the scale is anchored by &quot;no pruritus&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;worst imaginable pruritus&quot; (score of 100 mm). Baseline value is defined as values collected at Week 1 of Part 1 of the study.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Percent Change from Baseline in Absolute Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS score questionnaire consists of 12 items leading to 6 subscales or domains: sleep disturbance, sleep adequacy, daytime sleepiness, 'supposed or known' snoring, being awakened by shortness of breath or by a headache, and quantity of sleep. Subscales are standardised to yield scores from 0 to 100, with the exception of sleep quantity. Higher scores on the MOS score reflects more of the attribute indicated by the subscale name. Baseline value is defined as values collected at Week 1 of Part 1 of the study.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration up to Week 49</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse event (AE) is defined as &quot;any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant (regardless of the administration of the study drug and its causal relationship to it). An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended medical occurrence during the participant's participation in the trial, including deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition, an abnormal clinically significant finding in a laboratory assessment, or an abnormal clinically significant finding in the physical examination or vital sign. Any AE occurring following the start of treatment or occurring before treatment but increasing in severity afterward will be counted as TEAE.</description>
