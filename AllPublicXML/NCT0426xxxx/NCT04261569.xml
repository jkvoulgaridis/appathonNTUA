  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease has only pharmacological (essentially dopaminergic) and surgical
      treatment (essentially high-frequency deep brain stimulation), that are symptomatically
      effective. none of them is curative, and has the ability to slow down the disease and to
      protect dopaminergic neurons from death by neurodegeneration. Experimental results, based on
      preclinical studies, suggest that brain illumination in the Near-InfraRed (NIR) range is
      likely to slow down this neurodegenerative process.

      Thus, a medical device system (called Ev-NIRT) has been developed for 670 nm intracerebral
      illumination of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and is planned to be tested for
      the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

      In this pilot study the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and tolerance of surgery
      and brain illumination thanks to the Ev-NIRT medical device, in a group of 7 de novo
      Parkinson's patients implanted with the innovative medical device. Patients will be monitored
      for 4 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The level of neuroprotection induced by illumination at 670nm appears effective in
      preclinical studies, and justify the transfer into a clinical trial. The investigators
      currently have developed and produced implantable devices, to be implanted into the brain
      through a minimally invasive endoventricular route. The electrical energy required is
      supplied by the batteries adapted from those used for deep brain stimulation.

      The feasibility of trans ventricular implantation is ensured by the experience gained by our
      team in the endoventricular stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus in the cluster
      headache.

      In this clinical study, the investigators will evaluate the tolerance and safety of
      intraventricular surgical technic and illumination by the Ev-NIRT medical device implanted
      into the brain of 7 patients with Parkinson's disease. idiopathic, aged 25-65 years, at a
      very early stage (less than 2 years of evolution). The NIR illumination will begin
      immediately after surgery.

      The investigators will also evaluate secondarily, the neuroprotective effect of this new
      treatment modality, by comparing the decrease of dopaminergic neurons by Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET)-scan using [11C]PE2I) tracer of implanted patients to that of a control
      group of 7 patients whose characteristics in terms of duration of evolution and clinical
      severity are identical, but who are not implanted, and therefore not exposed to NIR
      illumination.

      The PET-scan-PE2I exam is conducted in both groups annually for 4 years (a total of 5
      measurements) and compared to the PE2I PET obtained at the beginning of participation in the
      study. A group-wide comparison will be made between the NIR group and the control group.
