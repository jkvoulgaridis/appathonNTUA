    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the neurobiological effect of tacrolimus in persons with MCI and
      dementia due to AD by measuring biomarkers of target engagement in immune response,
      amyloid-b, tau and neurodegeneration in CSF, functional connectivity with MRI and EEG, and
      cognition. Study objectives include:
