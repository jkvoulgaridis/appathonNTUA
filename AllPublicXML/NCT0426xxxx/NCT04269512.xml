  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, lymph node dissection is standard of care during prostatectomy of intermediate
      risk tumors at the Martini Clinic. It allows the assessment of possible but unlikely lymph
      nodes metastases. In case of lymph node metastasis, depending on the number of affected lymph
      nodes, an adjuvant radiation with or without additional hormone therapy may be discussed in
      order to stop or delay further progression of the disease.

      Since the procedure carries additional risks, it is controversial. The risks include
      prolonged surgery duration, injury of vessels and nerves, as well as disorders of lymphatic
      circulation after surgery. Moreover, formation of lymphoceles (accumulation of lymph fluid in
      the tissue) are common, which may result in soft tissue swelling, thrombosis, inflammation
      and additional surgical procedures.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether the removal of the lymph nodes during
      prostatectomy positively influences the course of the disease in patients with intermediate
      risk prostate cancer, or if the lymph node dissection does not have any influence on the
      recurrence of the disease and therefore further therapies.

      In this case, the omission of lymph node dissection may avoid an unnecessary expansion of the
      operation and the potentially associated side effects linked to it. This is particularly of
      interest considering the rapidly advancing technical possibilities, both in imaging and in
      the treatment of prostate cancer, since this enables an earlier and more individual
      intervention in the case of recurrence.

      The significance of lymph node dissection in radical prostatectomy has not been conclusively
      clarified. If a radical prostatectomy is planned, the question occurs if the additional
      pelvic lymph node dissection (LND) is justified and to what extent it should be performed
      (limited LND, standard LND or extended LND). On the one hand, the detection of lymph node
      metastases is associated with a significantly worse course of the tumor disease and requires
      immediate or delayed hormone-ablative therapy. On the other hand, the lymph node dissection
      is associated with risks (lymphoceles, thromboses, lymphedema), so that the indication in
      negative lymph node findings appears questionable. It must be weighed between the diagnostic
      advantage and the possibility of increased morbidity due to the lymphadenectomy. For
      localized intermediate risk prostate cancer (PSA&gt; 10 ng / ml - 20 ng / ml or Gleason score 7
      or cT category 2b ), there are currently no recommendations for performing a lymph node
      dissection during prostatectomy.
