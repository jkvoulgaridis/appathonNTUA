  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective chart review and entails review of medical records of patients
      enrolled in about 5 hospitals/clinics in China, and who have undergone breast augmentation or
      reconstruction with McGhan breast implants between 24 December 2015 and 31 December 2019. The
      safety of McGhan breast implants (textured and smooth) will be evaluated based on occurrence
      of local complications including capsular contracture, malposition of implant, seroma/late
      seroma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).
