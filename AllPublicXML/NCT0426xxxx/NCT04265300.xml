  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this research study to determine learn how daily habits and
      fluid choices impact children's health, sleep, cognitive function and mood. The investigators
      look to determine if a hydration intervention using an alternative beverage may impact these
      variables in children.

      Maintaining an appropriate level of hydration throughout the day has multiple health
      benefits. Maintaining a desirable hydration status improves overall health and wellbeing
      (mood, reaction time, sleep quality, cognitive function, etc.) in adults, but negative health
      and mental effects of hypohydration are not fully understood in an adolescent population.
      Maintaining appropriate hydration in adolescents presents unique challenges with respect to
      schedule (e.g. the availability of fluid during the school day and after school activities)
      as well as ensuring the most beneficial beverage choice. Adolescents can be very meticulous
      regarding their preferred beverage (e.g. choosing a sugary drink over water) and parents
      prefer their children consume the healthiest option for their food and beverages, often times
      leading to conflict.

      Therefore the purpose/goal of the proposed study is to determine if a hydration intervention
      using an alternative sweetened beverage will improve hydration and other overall health (e.g.
      cognitive function, sleep quality, mood etc.)

      The investigators hypothesize, that by giving children an alternative tasty option, they will
      consume more fluids which may lead to improving and maintaining their chronic hydration
      state. Implementing a beverage intervention with a sweet alternative option (i.e. Creative
      Roots) could improve hydration levels in adolescents. In turn, possibly improving mood,
      reaction time, sleep quality, and cognitive function. All of which are vital in the overall
      development of the adolescent.

Subjects will be asked the keep their empty Creative Roots bottles to return them to the lab. Subjects will be instructed to refrigerate the beverages for better taste, and to refrigerate the beverages after opening.</description>
