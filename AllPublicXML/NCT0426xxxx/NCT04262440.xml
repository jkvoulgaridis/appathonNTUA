  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal amount caloric intake were still controversy in critically ill patients in
      literature. There were no significant outcome difference with different caloric intake in
      acute lung injury patients. In order to identify the optimal amount caloric intake in acute
      lung injury patients, we conduct a prospectively observational study to see whether the
      caloric differences influence hospital mortality.

      The is a prospectively observational study. The data including basic demographic data, daily
      PN/EN caloric intake, days of ICU stay, days of hospital stay, hospital mortality, days of
      ventilator use.. will be collected. Statistic analysis included chi-square, student t test,
      logistic regression and ROC curve will be applied to analyze the different characteristics
      between survived and died patients. Also we can figure out the optimal cut value of caloric
      intake with best outcome by ROC curve analysis. We plan enrolled 200 participants within
      study period.
