  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
      CD123 CAR-T cells may have an attractive and permanent effect on anti-tumor. This study
      purpose to estimate the safety and efficiency of CD123 CAR-T cells to patients with
      relapse/refractory AML.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD123 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is a ideal target for CAR-T. Some
      researches have revealed that CD123 is a marker of leukemia stem cells, which indicates that
      the eradication of CD123 cells may prevent relapse of leukemia. In this study, investigators
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting CD123 in patients with Acute
      Myelocytic Leukemia. The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse
      events and disease status after treatment.
