      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and incentive
      spirometer on ventilatory functions in post-menopausal asthmatic women. Participants and
      methods: A total of forty postmenopausal women suffering from asthma, their ages ranged from
      50 to 60 years old, and their body mass index of the patient don't exceed 30kg/m2. They were
      recruited from patient chest clinic in Kasr -El- Ainy Teaching Hospital, Cairo University,
      Egypt.

      They signed a consent form, confidentiality was assured. They assigned into two groups (A)
      who received inspiratory muscle training in the form of: Inspiratory threshold muscle trainer
      in addition to traditional chest physical therapy intervention (Deep breath, cough training)
      while patients in group (B): received traditional chest physical therapy intervention and
      incentive spirometer, three sessions per week for six weeks. Patients in both groups were
      assessed before treatment (pre-training) then after treatment (post-training) (after 6 weeks)
      to measure lung functions using electronic spirometer. The training program was carried in
      the duration from January 2019 to July 2019.

    <description>Patient had to produce a high inspiratory pressure. The ball serves as visible feedback of the inspiratory flow and indicates the obtained flow on a calibrated scale on the transparent cylinder of the spirometer. If the patient flows greater than 300 milliliters per second, the float ball in first chamber will rise. As patient flow increases to 600 milliliters per second the second ball float will rise. If the patient flow exceeds 900 milliliters per second all three will be suspended. Patient should encourage holding the balls up for a few seconds</description>

    <description>The threshold trainer is a small plastic handheld device supplied by respironics. It includes a mouthpiece and a calibrated spring loaded valve. The valve controls a constant inspiratory pressure training load and the patient must generate the inspiratory pressure in order for the inspiratory valve to be opened and allow inhalation of air.</description>
