      Background:

      Immunotherapy drugs use a person s own immune system to help fight cancer. These drugs work
      better for some people than others. The drug M7824 has helped some people with cancer. But it
      can cause side effects. Researchers want to learn all the side effects that M7824 can cause.
      Once they do, they can prevent or reduce these side effects in future cancer treatments. This
      will lead to better overall outcomes for people with cancer.

      Objective:

      To make a thorough list of adverse events in people with cancer being treated with systemic
      therapies including M7824 at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

      Eligibility:

      Participants previously enrolled in NCI protocols #15-C-0179 and #18-C-0056

      Design:

      All needed data have already been collected. These data are stored in existing records and
      databases.

      Researchers will review the medical records of adults with cancer who were enrolled in the
      above protocols. The data collected will be relevant to the specific objectives being
      addressed.

      Data will be collected only if 2 conditions are met. One, the principal investigator gave
      permission for use of the data gathered in the trial. Two, the participants of the trial did
      not opt out of future use of the data.

      Other protocols may be added. This will be done with an amendment.

      Immunotherapy agents utilize the immune system to help fight cancer. A number of
      immunotherapy drugs have been approved for use in certain cancers. Despite being effective in
      some patients, many of these promising drugs do not demonstrate efficacy in other patients.
      M7824 (MSB0011359C), a bifunctional fusion protein that blocks both PD-L1 and transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, is a promising novel drug that has proven
      efficacious in a subset of cancer patients. However, we have observed side effects in
      patients receiving M7824 that include both immune related adverse events and skin neoplasms.
      It is imperative that these M7824 side effects be identified and characterized so that they
      can be prevented or diminished during future cancer treatments. By thoroughly analyzing the
      side effect profile of this drug, management of adverse effects and overall patient outcomes
      can be better understood and optimized.

      The primary goal of this protocol is to perform a retrospective chart review for the
      investigation of the adverse events arising in cancer patients being treated with systemic
      therapies including M7824 at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This study will not involve
      the use of specimens or participant contact. All data that are needed have already been
      collected on the individual treatment protocols and are available in CRIS records or protocol
      specific databases. Data will only be collected from treatment protocols where the PI has
      given permission for use of the data on the trial the subjects were enrolled on and the
      subjects did not opt out of future use of data. This protocol will be amended to incorporate
      new research objectives and new protocols as necessary.
