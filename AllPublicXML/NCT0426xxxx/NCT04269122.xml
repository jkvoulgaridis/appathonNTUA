  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to characterize 24-hour plasma ammonia levels, characterize
      urea production rates in healthy normal subjects.

    <textblock>
      During Part 1, eligible subjects will be asked to participate in 3 inpatient visits, each
      lasting up to 3 days (Day -1 to Day 2). Each visit will assess 24-hour ammonia levels in
      plasma and rate of urea production for 4 hours following ingestion of [1-13C]sodium acetate.
      Sodium acetate is used as a tracer to measure the rate of ureagenesis.

      During Part 2, eligible subjects will be asked to participate in 1 inpatient visit, lasting
      up to 3 days (Day -1 to Day 2). The visit will assess 24-hour ammonia levels in plasma and
      rate of urea production for 4 hours following ingestion of [1-13C]sodium acetate. Sodium
      acetate is used as a tracer to measure the rate of ureagenesis.
