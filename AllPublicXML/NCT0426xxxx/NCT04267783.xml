    <textblock>
      Prospective study evaluating the feasibility of shear-wave elastography of the uterus during
      the third stage of labour and following placental delivery. We hypothesize that the stiffness
      of the myometrium can be measured by using shear-wave technology. Our study involves 50
      patients with a healthy pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. One co-investigator will
      carry out measurements at the uterine fundus, at three different time points: after fetal
      delivery, after placental delivery and 30 minutes after placental delivery.
