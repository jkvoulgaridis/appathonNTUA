  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is to compare preoperative and postoperative binocular functional vision in patients
      with unilateral intraocular len（IOL） in one eye and mild cataract in the fellow eye.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects are the patients who underwent monocular IOL implantation before and present
      mild cataract in the fellow eye.Compare preoperative and postoperative the binocular
      functional vision and the satisfaction of patients when the patients ask for the surgery
      (phacoemulsification and IOLs implantation)on the fellow eye. The type of IOLs maybe
      according to the patients preference and the eyes condition.The subjects will be divided into
      three groups according to the type of the IOLs，including monofocal group,bifocal group,and
      trifocal group.

    <measure>binocular visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA), intermediate visual acuity, near visual acuity will be measured at 5m, 80cm and 40cm respectively. All visual acuity measurements will be conducted under photopic conditions (85 cd/m2) and at 100% contrast</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binocular Contrast sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity measures will be conducted binocularly, under photopic, mesopic (5 cd/m2), photopic with glare and mesopic with glare conditions, with the OPTEC 6500 contrast sensitivity test (Stereo Optical, USA). Contrast sensitivity will be evaluated at five spatial frequencies (1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree [cpd]). Patients will be allowed 5 minutes to adapt to each illumination level before testing</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binocular Defocus Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Binocular defocus curves will be obtained in all patients, positioned at 5m under photopic (&gt;85 cd/m 2 ) condition to measure the visual acuity with each defocus lens, representing the consecutive visual function of each eye. Negative lenses were added in 0.50 D steps and the visual acuity will be recorded for each type of defocus level. The procedure will be then repeated but with positive lenses. The range of defocus evaluated is from -4.00D to +2.00D.</description>

    <measure>stereopsis</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion function</measure>
