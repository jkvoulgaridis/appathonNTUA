  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients have prostate cancer that was treated with surgery or radiation therapy for
      localized disease and there is evidence of biochemical recurrence and/or metastases on
      conventional imaging.The objective of this study is to assess the performance in detection of
      prostate cancer of a new positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for prostate cancer
      ([18F]-DCFPyl) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results of tracer uptake and
      MRI image features as whole body PET/MRI and dedicated pelvic/prostate PET/MRI, alone and
      together, will be correlated and compared to detection of lesions on conventional imaging
      modalities. Additionally, if the patient undergoes a biopsy as standard of care, image
      features will correlate directly with histopathological findings.Validation of this
      radiotracer can potentially lead to its use as a standard of care for future imaging and
      improve diagnosis and treatment guidance.This drug is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and is therefore considered experimental.There will be 20 subjects
      enrolled in this study; all of these patients will be enrolled at Stony Brook University
      Medical Center.

      The study objective is to assess the performance of [18F]-DCFPyl PET with whole-body MRI and
      multiparametric pelvic/prostate MRI for PCa detection in men with recurrence as determined by
      biochemical PSA level or evidence on CIM. Results of tracer uptake and MRI image features on
      whole body PET/MRI and dedicated pelvic/prostate PET/MRI, alone and together, will be
      correlated and compared to detection of lesions on CIM that usually includes bone scan (BS)
      and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, or PET imaging with F-18 Fluciclovine. In addition, in
      patients who undergo a biopsy when performed as standard of care, image features will
      correlate directly with histopathological findings on lesion biopsy to directly demonstrate
      that 'radiotracer and/or MRI positive' lesions contain tumor cells.

      To test the hypothesis, this study is being proposed using the [18F]-DCFPyL PET tracer for
      the detection of PCa in patients with biochemical recurrence or evidence on CIM. The
      [18F]-DCFPyL PET tracer will be provided by the company Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (New
      York, New York) and conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) approval received by
      Stony Brook University.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subject has prostate cancer treated with surgery, radiation therapy and/or
             chemotherapy for localized disease

          -  subject has biochemical recurrence defined in postsurgical patients as a PSA value = &gt;
             0.2 ng/mL followed by a subsequent confirmatory PSA value = &gt;0.2 ng/mL according to
             the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines, or three consecutive rises above
             the nadir in patients following radiation therapy according to the American Society
             for Radiation Therapy and Oncology (ASTRO).

          -  in most cases, it will be required that the patient has had a prior CIM scan (such as
             a BS, MRI, CT or PET with F-18 Fluciclovine) performed before enrollment in this
             study; the only exception would be if the PSA level of the patient is remarkably high
             indicating apparent recurrence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  less than 18 years of age (prostate cancer is not prevalent in the pediatric
             population);

          -  any contraindications to MRI imaging such as electrical implants, cardiac pacemakers
             or perfusion pumps;

          -  ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial
             hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or
             ferromagnetic objects such as jewelry or metal clips in clothing;

          -  is unable to lie comfortably on a bed inside the scanner for 60 minutes as assessed by
             physical examination and medical history (e.g. back pain, arthritis);

          -  if they have had treatment with investigational drug within 30 days prior to trial
             enrollment;

          -  if they had administration of another radioisotope within five physical half-lives of
             trial enrollment;

          -  if they had radiation or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to trial enrollment;

        Eligibility will be determined by a screening interview. All subjects recruited for the
        study will be able to withdraw from the study at any time.
