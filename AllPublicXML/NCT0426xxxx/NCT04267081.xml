  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center two-stage, two-arm, open label phase II study of venetoclax in
      combination with azacytidine in acute myeloid leukemia patients selected for therapy with ex
      vivo venetoclax sensitivity screening. This study will characterize the usability of ex vivo
      drug sensitivity testing for patient selection for selecting the responsive patients for
      venetoclax therapy. The exploratory study will aim to find novel combinations for overcoming
      resistance as well as finding/validating biomarkers for both sensitivity and resistance.

    <description>This arm will recruit the patients with de novo AML unfit for conventional chemotherapy. In validation cohort all the participants will receive azacytidine-venetoclax. In study cohort the patients with ex vivo resistance to venetoclax will be excluded from the study therapy.
All patients in validation and study cohorts (ARM1 and ARM2) will receive azacytidine and venetoclax. The purpose for the validation cohort is to validate the specificity and sensitivity of the ex vivo drug testing. Patients exhibiting ex vivo sensitivity and receiving azacytidine-venetoclax in validation cohort are analyzed also for study cohort.</description>
