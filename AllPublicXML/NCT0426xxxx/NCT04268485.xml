  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease with a poor prognosis. More
      accurate tests to predict disease progression and response to treatment are required.

      Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is a blood marker associated with IPF. Results from previous
      studies have shown that levels of KL-6 are higher in patients with IPF compared to people
      without the disease. In addition, it is not clear what impact treatment has on KL-6 levels,
      and whether this could help us to monitor how effective treatment for IPF is.

      The investigators plan to perform a study in which KL-6 levels in the blood of patients with
      a new diagnosis of IPF are measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months to look for and changes
      in the levels of KL-6 in the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease with a poor prognosis.
      Effective treatment which slows the progression of IPF has recently become available however,
      it is costly and at present is limited to patients who meet specific criteria based on their
      breathing tests. The breathing tests currently available to monitor progression of the
      disease are not always reliable and do not predict which patients will respond to treatment.
      More accurate tests to predict disease progression and response to treatment are required.

      Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is a blood marker associated with IPF. Results from previous
      studies have shown that levels of KL-6 are higher in patients with IPF compared to people
      without the disease. The majority of studies using KL-6 in IPF have taken place in Japan and
      there is limited evidence of how useful it is in a European population. In addition, it is
      not clear what impact treatment has on KL-6 levels, and whether this could help us to monitor
      how effective treatment for IPF is.

      The investigators plan to perform a study in which KL-6 levels in the blood of patients with
      a new diagnosis of IPF are measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months to look for and changes
      in the levels of KL-6 in the blood

      The objective of this study is to assess changes in serum KL-6 levels in patients with IPF
      over a 12-month period and assess if this correlates with changes in lung function and if
      KL-6 levels change in response to treatment with antifibrotic therapy.
