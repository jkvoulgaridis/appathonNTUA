  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strengthening and stretching exercise programs, and recommendations to protect the affected
      joint have shown to be effective both clinically and economically in conditions such as hand
      osteoarthritis and hand rheumatoid arthritis. However, their application format is not up to
      date. In this sense, problems such as the lack of monitoring by the health professional and
      the lack of patients motivation may cause poor adherence to the treatment protocol, which is
      one of the main predictors of treatment efficiency. Therefore, an smartphone application has
      been developed for the rehabilitation of hand osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis to
      enhance patients adherence and motivation. The smartphone application includes: a) exercise
      programs and recommendations based on the most up to date scientific evidence adapted to the
      pathology; and b) enhancers of patient adherence to treatment (patient diaries and behavioral
      change strategies).The objective is to develop a cost effective digital solution to optimize
      the health care offered to these pathologies based on up to date scientific evidence in order
      to improve the functional ability and the quality of life of these patients, and to reduce
      the number of consultations to primary and specialized care.
