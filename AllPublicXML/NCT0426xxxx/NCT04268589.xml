  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effect of a virtual reality experience on pain, depression
      and functional adequacy in geriatric individuals living in a nursing home.

      A virtual reality video with dance moves has been applied to the experimental group
      participants. Each video takes 3 minutes, and the elderly person has been put into practice
      at least 30 minutes after having breakfast in 3-minute periods and at least 30 minutes after
      dinner. In the morning and evening, 15 minutes, 2 times a day, a total of 9 days were applied
      for 3 weeks. The application lasted a total of 3 weeks. Scales were applied 1 week after the
      virtual reality application was completed and 1 month after the experimental group. The
      scales were filled in the control group at the same time.

      It is recommended that the future studies be conducted with larger samples on pain,
      depression, life quality and functionality.

    <measure>The visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>nine days</time_frame>
    <description>This form includes numbers and is used in the assessment of pain severity. Patients mark their pain severity on a 10 cm ruler which is written no pain on one side and the most severe pain as possible on the other side. It has been stated that VAS is more sensitive and reliable in the measurement of pain severity than one sized scales</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>nine days</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed by Yesavage with the aim of assessing the depression symptoms of old persons and consists of 15 questions in total. In the assessment, 1 point is given to each &quot;no&quot; answer in the positive questions and to each &quot;yes&quot; answer in the negative questions. A score of 6 and higher in the scale is accepted as meaningful for the diagnosis of depression. Reliability and validity tests were performed in our country and Chronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.92</description>
