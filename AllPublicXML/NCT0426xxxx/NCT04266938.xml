      Impact of Rapid ART Initiation on Retention in Care in the Southern US

      Specific Goals and Aims:

      The major goal for this study is to determine if rapid start of antiretroviral (ART) therapy
      increases retention in HIV medical care. The investigators hypothesize that there will be an
      increase in retention in care with rapid start, by removing barriers that would normally
      delay enrollment in a treatment program and enforce the importance of linkage to care and ART
      initiation from diagnosis.

      In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators have the following specific aims for
      their proposed study:

        1. Study retention in care after rapid ART start in comparison to standard of care.

        2. Analyze risk factors for decreased retention in care, with focus on high-risk
           populations.

        3. Analyze potential demographic and geographic determinants of retention in care.

        4. Generate retention in care data in a Southern US state.

      The investigators hypothesize the introduction of rapid start ART, as well as the
      introduction of care navigators, will lead to improved clinical outcomes, including retention
      in care at one year, viral suppression at one year, time to viral suppression, and time to
      first missed appointment. In the event rapid start ART fails to have a positive impact on
      clinical outcomes, the results of this study will still positively contribute to the
      knowledge gap, since there is a scarcity of data in the Southern United States, specifically
      in high-risk populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, youth, and patients
      co-infected with hepatitis C.
