  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators sought to clarify the influence of FIO2 levels on the
      variables in the Fick equation and then assessed the influence of each variable on the
      accuracy of Fick-CO measurements in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

    <textblock>
      Patients who are aged ≥20 years, are undergoing planned elective cardiac surgery, and
      provided signed informed consent are included in the present study. Any patients with an
      intra-cardiac shunt are excluded.

      The patients are randomly assigned to 2 groups: FIO2 &lt;0.7 or FIO2 &gt;0.85. And during the
      surgery, the oximeter values are kept ≥98%. Intra-operatively, FIO2, PaO2, SaO2, SvO2, PvO2,
      Hb, blood pH values, body temperature and TD-CO are recorded.

    <measure>The Precision of Fick-based Cardiac Output in Different FIO2 Groups during Cardiac Surgeries</measure>
    <time_frame>under general anesthesia but before surgical incision</time_frame>
    <description>After collecting the elements data included in the Fick eqaution (oxygen consumption, hemoglobin, SaO2, SvO2, PaO2, and PvO2), we can calculate the Fick-based cardiac output in each patient. And the pulmonary artery thermodilution is adopted as the standard cardiac output monitoring method. We will calculate the correlation and level of agreement between Fick-based cardiac output and pulmonary artery thermodilution in the two groups.</description>
