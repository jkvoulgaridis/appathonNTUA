    <textblock>
      Many women despite being well-treated in proper dose, with proper drug and for proper
      duration, may not respond to different forms of prolactin normalizing drugs.

      This will lead to extension of the treatment duration up to months or even years.

      Doctors usually increase the dose of the drug with high possibility of side effects and even
      complications. Some doctors change drug group to another without any significant improvement
      of hyperprolactinemia. hyperprolactinemia can indicate a deeper issue, about 10 percent of
      the population has hyperprolactinemia. Life style, feeding habits and sexual behaviors are
      usually not included in the management protocols of hyperprolactinemia.

      Aim of the study:

      This study will be aimed to:

        1. Evaluate the effect of nursing role in the management of hyperprolactinemia.

        2. Give health education for women underlying forms of prolactin normalizing drugs for
           hyperprolactinemia.

      Hypothesis of the study:

      H1- Health education for women under drugs of hyperprolactinemia is effective in reduce level
      of prolactine.

      H0- Health education for women under drugs of hyperprolactinemia is not effective in reduce
      level of prolactin
