  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study included both in- and outpatients suffering from liver cirrhosis attending the out-
      and inpatient care of the department of hepatology. Demographic and biochemical data as well
      as medical history including cause of liver cirrhosis, end stage kidney failure and
      medication with anticoagulants were recorded. To assess the hemostatic profile, platelet
      function was analyzed by multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) using Multiplate (ADP-, ASPI-
      and TRAP-test) and thrombelastometry using ROTEM (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM).

        All patients attending the in- and outpatient care of the department of hepatology between
        12/2017 and 05/2018 meeting the inclusion criteria were offered to participate in the
        present study. Inclusion criteria were liver cirrhosis and age of ≥ 18 years. Furthermore,
        a platelet count of at least 70 x103/µL was mandatory to ensure adequate measurement of MEA
        using the Multiplate analyzer. Patients were excluded when given a platelet concentrate
        three weeks prior to inclusion or in case of pregnancy.
