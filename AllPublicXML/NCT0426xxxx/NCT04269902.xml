      This phase III trial compares early treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab versus delayed
      treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with the
      venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes
      for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to
      starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate whether early treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab (V-O) extends overall
      survival (OS) compared with delayed treatment with V-O in high-risk (Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia [CLL] International Prognostic Indicator [CLL-IPI] &gt;= 4 or complex cytogenetics),
      newly diagnosed asymptomatic CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall response rates (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]), CR
      rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and event-free survival (EFS) between arms.

      II. To evaluate safety and tolerability of each arm. III. To compare time to second
      CLL-directed treatment (from randomization and from response) between arms.

      IV. To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) and time to second objective disease progression
      (PFS2) between arms.

      V. To compare the rates of Richter's transformation between arms. VI. To describe
      distribution of Cumulative Illness Rating Scale across the study, in each treatment arm, and
      to estimate the interaction between the scale and treatment arm and OS.

      PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of early intervention with V-O versus delayed therapy with V-O in CLL
      patients in relation to Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) using the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Leukemia scale.

      II. To assess the impact of the two treatment arms on the specific domains of the
      FACT-Leukemia, including physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being and
      leukemia-specific HRQoL.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (DELAYED V-O): Treatment begins once 2018 IWCLL indications are met. Patients receive
      obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1
      of cycles 2-6. Patients also receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 22-28 of
      cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of cycles 2-12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (EARLY V-O): Treatment begins as soon as eligibility criteria are met. Patients
      receive obinutuzumab IV over 4 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of
      cycles 2-6. Patients also receive venetoclax PO QD on days 22-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28
      of cycles 2-12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 10 years after
      registration.

             therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial

          -  Patients may not have had major surgery within 30 days prior registration or minor
             surgery within 7 days prior to registration. Examples of major surgery include
             neurosurgical procedures, joint replacements, and surgeries that occur inside the

             skin, or non-melanomatous skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, superficial bladder
             cancer not treated with intravesical chemotherapy or Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)

             therapy, or localized breast cancer requiring no more than chronic hormonal therapy

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing, as there are no safety data available for
             these drug regimens during pregnancy. Women/men of reproductive potential must have
             agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of
             &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12
             consecutive months. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective
             contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent
             pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  Patients must be offered participation in banking for future research. With patient's
             consent, specimens must be submitted

          -  Patients who are able to complete patient reported outcome (PRO) forms in English,
             Spanish, French, German, Russian or Mandarin must agree to participate in the quality
             of life assessments. (Those patients who are unable to read and write in English,
             Spanish, French, German, Russian or Mandarin may be registered to S1925 without
             contributing to the quality of life portion of the study.)

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign
