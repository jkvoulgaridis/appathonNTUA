  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhage is a challenging complication of pelvic surgery. In this study, the investigators
      aimed to analyze the causes, management, and outcomes of major pelvic hemorrhage in patients
      undergoing complex abdomino-pelvic surgery. Participants who had a major intraoperative
      pelvic hemorrhage during complex abdomino-pelvic surgery at 11 tertiary referral centers were
      included. Participant characteristics, causes of hemorrhage, management strategies, and
      outcomes including morbidity and mortality analyses were evaluated.

        Patient operated for complex abdominopelvic surgery including radical oncologic operations
        for the primary advanced or recurrent carcinoma of pelvic organs, pelvic cytoreduction,
        revisional/redo operations for failed ileal/colonic pouches, repair of the entero-enteral,
        entero-cutaneous, entero-vesical and entero-vaginal fistulas who had presacral bleeding in
        centers which had over 225 colorectal cases per year were included. Major pelvic bleeding
        is defined as symptomatic bleeding originating from pelvis, bleeding leading to transfusion
        of ≥2 units of whole blood or packed red cells; surgical site bleeding that requires a
        second intervention; or surgical site bleeding that is unexpected and prolonged and/or
        sufficiently large to cause hemodynamic instability with an associated decrease in
        hemoglobin ≥20 g/L.
