      This will be a confirmatory, prospective, open-label, single-arm, reader-blinded,
      multi-centre phase 3 study to assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of
      Ferrotran®-enhanced MRI in comparison to unenhanced MRI in the detection of pelvic lymph node
      metastases in newly-diagnosed adult patients with prostate cancer and an increased risk for
      lymph node metastases of 20% to 60%, based on the Briganti nomogram.

  <detailed_description>

      Potential patients for this study will be recruited by up to 10 centres specialised in
      prostate cancer. Study sites will be interdisciplinary, consisting of a uro-oncology
      sub-site, and a radiology sub-site with high-quality MRI, surgery and pathology. Study visits
      will be typically conducted at the recruiting sub-site, or as institutionally appropriate.
      Treatment visits for patients will be performed in the collaborating sub-site. Patients will
      be invited for study participation by the investigators in the context of specialised
      clinics. Interested patients will be provided with an information sheet and will undergo a
      detailed informed consent procedure prior to any study procedures. Recruitment will be
      continued until a sufficient number of patients have undergone Ferrotran® imaging and
      histopathological evaluation.

      To compensate for an expected drop-out rate of 15% to 20%, recruitment will only be stopped
      as soon as at least 69 evaluable positive (patients positive) and at least 104 evaluable
      negative (patients negative) patients are available for analysis.

    <description>Ferrotran® in a dose of 0.13 mL/kg body weight of the reconstituted freeze-dried preparation (i.e. 2.6 mgFe/kg body weight). The recommended dose should be diluted in 100 mL of NaCl 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection/infusion prior to administration via the infusion filter as a slow intravenous infusion over 30 minutes (at a maximum rate of 4 mL/min).
Ferrotran® will be administered once to each patient. Histologically confirmed diagnosis and pre-operative staging are performed prior to the study as part of standard care. Surgery (RP with ePLND) and sampling of tissue specimens is performed after the Ferrotran®-enhanced MRI as part of standard care.</description>
