  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to find out whether changes in household and personal
      behavior aimed at reducing exposure to environmental chemicals in dust (increased house dust
      removal efforts/cleaning and hand washing) and consumer products (increased us of personal
      care and beauty products that are free of chemicals including phthalates, parabens, and
      phenols) results in lower exposure to environmental chemicals including polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAHs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals including phthalates, parabens and
      phenols. These chemicals may have harmful health effects, as they can interfere with normal
      functions of the body. This study will also assess changes in breast tissue composition to
      understand the role of environmental exposures in breast cancer risk.

    <measure>Feasibility of measuring pre/post-intervention change in participants' breast tissue concentration of lipid (mg/cm^3) measured using an Optical Spectroscopy machine.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Breast tissue composition will be assessed at each clinic visit using an Optical Breast Spectroscopy machine, a minimally invasive procedure that is investigational and not currently FDA-approved. This machine places a light source on 4 different locations of the breast (at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock) and reads the reflected light through the breast tissue. The OS exam will be completed twice on each side of the chest so that 8 measures are taken from the left breast and 8 measures will be taken from the right breast (with each measurement taking no more than a minute). A Monte-Carlo light propagation simulation technique (FullMonte) will be used to extract breast tissue concentration of lipid (mg/cm^3).</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of measuring pre/post-intervention change in urinary metabolites of endocrine disrupting chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), phthalates, and parabens (all measured in μg/L units) .</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spot urines will be collected from mothers and daughters in each study arm at the pre-intervention and post-intervention clinic visits. Samples will be processed, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C within two hours of collection. Urinary concentrations of metabolites (μg/L) of PAH, phthalates and parabens will be measured in urine samples using commercially available ELISA kits. Blood samples will also be collected at pre- and post-intervention clinic visits using standard protocol, with the buffy coat of white blood cells, packed red blood cells, and plasma separated and stored in multiple aliquots at -80°C for future analyses. Each urine and blood sample will receive a unique barcode, blinding the lab technician to the study arms.</description>

    <description>Mother-daughter pairs will partake in an educational session at the baseline visit, which will cover topics on reading product labels, cleaning habit, and cooking methods for reducing environmental exposures. Educational materials will be adapted from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other accredited sources. Participants will also be introduced to free resources for consumer product safety information, such as the Detox Me phone application. Participants in the intervention arm will receive a 6-month supply of soap, lotion, deodorant, lip balm, a mop, cleaning cloths, and an air filter to take home with them. Mother-daughter pairs in both study arms will return for a second clinic visit 6 months after the pre-intervention visit for blood and urine sample collection, Optical Spectroscopy (OS) measurement, and questionnaire completion.</description>

    <description>This study will focus the intervention on ways at the individual level to reduce sources of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (through cooking methods, exposure to cigarette smoking, indoor air filters) and also individual ways to reduce sources of other Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals. Mother-daughter pairs will partake in an educational session at the baseline visit, covering topics on reading labels, cleaning habits, and cooking methods for reducing exposures. Participants will also be introduced to free resources for consumer product safety information. The intervention arm will receive a 6-month supply of soap, lotion, deodorant, lip balm, a mop, cleaning cloths, and an air filter to take home with them. Pairs in both study arms will return for a second clinic visit 6 months after the pre-intervention visit for blood and urine sample collection, Optical Spectroscopy measurement, and questionnaire completion. The control arm will be offered the intervention products at this time.</description>
