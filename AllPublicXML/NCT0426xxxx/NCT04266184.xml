      This study investigates the effects of pelvic belt (PB) and kinesio taping (KT) applications
      on pain and functional mobility in pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP), in comparison
      with the control group that received only pain neuroscience education and ergonomic training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is strong evidence in the literature that pelvic support belts reduce pain in
      pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain, no study investigating its effect on functional
      mobility with performance-based measurement methods or investigating its effectiveness on
      kinesiophobia has been found. Studies investigating the efficacy of KT in pregnant women with
      PGP are few and many are methodologically weak studies, most of which do not contain
      randomization and control groups. Also, no study has been found in the literature, which
      compares the effectiveness of PB and KT in pregnant women with PGP. Therefore, the primary
      aim of this study is to examine the effects of PB and KT on pain and functional mobility in
      pregnant women with PGP in comparison with the control group, which is only given pain
      neuroscience education and ergonomic training. The secondary aims are to investigate the
      effects of these applications on kinesiophobia, activity limitation and sleep quality; and to
      compare the groups in regard to patient compliance and treatment satisfaction levels of the
      groups.

    <description>For abdominal taping, four I-shaped tapes will be used. Two of them will start from the superior symphisis pubis, follow the rectus abdominis muscle, and finish at the xiphoid process. Other two I-shaped tapes will start from the mid-symphisis pubis, follow the external oblique abdominals, and finish at the spina iliaca anterior superiors.
Symphisis pubis taping will be applied with two I-shaped tapes, by forming a &quot;X&quot; shape.
For lumbopelvic taping, three I-shaped KTs will be used. Two tapes will be applied bilaterally and longitudinally on the lumbar erector spinal muscles. The third tape will start from one sacroiliac joint and end at the other, vertically to the previous two tapes, forming a H-shape.
All tapings will be applied with 15-25% tension (tape-off tension). KTs will stay three days. They will be removed from the site, and the skin will be checked and cleaned. Then, they will be reapplied for the next three days.</description>
