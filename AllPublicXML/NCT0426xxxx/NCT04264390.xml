  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study pilots the efficacy of a home-based movement-to-music program for increasing
      physical activity participation among adolescents with cerebral palsy. Half of the
      participants will receive the movement-to-music program immediately, which will include 8
      weeks of exercise videos and periodic behavioral coaching calls. The other half of
      participants will wait 8-weeks before receiving the M2M program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The movement-to-music program has been tested among adults with physical disabilities and is
      currently being used in ongoing scale-up clinical trials. Current evidence suggests that the
      program can increase aspects of physical function among adults. The present study aims to
      test whether the same program can be used among adolescents with cerebral palsy. Study
      findings will be used to examine whether the videos require modifications prior to being
      implemented in a future scale-up trial for young people with cerebral palsy.

    <measure>Physical activity participation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participation in home, extracurricular, and community activities measured via the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE). The CAPE is used to document changes in everyday activities outside of the school-setting. The CAPE provides 3 levels of scoring: 1) overall participation scores; 2) domain scores that reflect participation in formal and informal activities; and 3) scores that reflect participation in 5 types of activity (active, physical, recreation, social, skill-based, and self-improvement activities).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise self-efficacy will be measured with the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES). The ESES contains 8-items that assess an individual's perceived confidence in their ability to exercise three times per week, with at least 40 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per session. Questions are scored on scales ranging from 0-100%, where a higher score is indicative of greater perceived level of confidence to participate in physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal-setting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Goal-setting will be measured by the Exercise Goal Setting Scale (EGS). The EGS contains 10-items related to how an individual sets goals and plans exercise activities and another 10-items that assess how an individual fits exercise into their lifestyle. Questions for each of the 2 subcategories (goal-setting and planning) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (does not describe) to 5 (describes completely). A higher score for the goal-setting subcategory reflects a greater skillset for setting and achieving goals. A higher score in the planning subcategory reflects a greater perceived ability to schedule exercise within the person's lifestyle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be measured by the Physical Activity Climate Questionnaire (PACQ), which was modified from a 12-item version of the questionnaire that demonstrated discriminant and convergent validity to assess physical activity climate among youth. The PACQ is a 15-item child-report measure of the perceived motivational 'climate' or autonomous support provided by the caregiver with regard to physical activity participation. Due to the nature of the questions, participants will be instructed to complete the PACQ without parental assistance. Questions are scored on a 7-point likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher average scores reflect a higher level of child-perceptions of autonomous support for physical activity behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome expectations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome expectations will be measured by the Multidimensional Outcomes Expectations for Exercise Scale (MOEES). The MOEES contains 15-items that assess three domains of outcome expectations, namely, physical, social, and self-evaluative outcome expectations. Questions are scored on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and totaled for each outcome expectation category.</description>

    <description>Movement-to-music is a physical activity program that was developed onsite at a state-of-the-art adapted fitness facility. The program includes movements that are coupled with music to enhance muscular strength, cardiorespiratory capacity, flexibility, and balance. For this study, the program will be packaged into playlists of exercise videos that will be given to participants. Participants will be instructed to complete the prescribed videos 3 times per week. Participants will also be asked to attend 4 behavioral coaching calls with a telecoach. The goals of the behavioral coaching calls will be to address issues with the technology components of the program and promote physical activity participation within the community and adherence to the movement-to-music videos.</description>
