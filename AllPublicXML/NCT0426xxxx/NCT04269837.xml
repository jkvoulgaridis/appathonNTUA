    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies a sexual health counseling intervention during radiation therapy
      in improving quality of life for women with gynecologic cancer. Women with gynecologic cancer
      often suffer long-term complications from treatment that can affect their physical and
      psychological well-being. An early sexual health counseling intervention prior to and after
      radiation may improve symptoms management and reduce the physical and psychological effects
      of treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the feasibility of a sexual health counseling intervention before and after
      pelvic radiation for women with gynecologic cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of a sexual health counseling intervention on
      patient reported outcomes in quality of life, sexual function, and genitourinary symptoms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sexual health counseling prior to starting and at the completion of
      radiation.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 6 months after radiation.
