  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and their family caregivers experience the impact of
      this neurodegenerative disease on their health and well-being. The person living with MS and
      their support partner need to work together as a team to find ways to manage the disease. A
      physical activity (PA) program that uses a 'dyadic approach' is one possible way of managing
      the impact of MS. Dyadic programs are unique because they target both people with the disease
      and their caregivers together to increase their PA levels. This pilot study will deliver a
      12-week program using group teleconference and one-on-one support phone calls to teach
      participants simple methods to change PA patterns in daily life. For example, they will learn
      how to set personal goals to increase PA and reduce sitting time.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an assessor-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for examining the
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a dyadic PA intervention approach for persons with MS
      (PwMS) affected by moderate-to-severe disability and their family caregivers (CGs). Dyads who
      meet the eligibility requirements will undergo the informed consent process and baseline
      assessment.

      Dyads will then be randomized to either an immediate intervention condition or a delayed
      control condition. Participants in the immediate intervention group will receive six group
      teleconference sessions, approximately 60 minutes each, every other week for 12 weeks. These
      sessions will be interspersed with one-on-one support calls in the weeks that group sessions
      do not occur. Participants will be provided with a manual for their individual use during the
      intervention. The intervention content will introduce participants to the concepts of shared
      appraisal and dyadic coping. The benefits of shared participation in PA as a coping strategy
      to optimize well-being at both the individual and dyadic level will be reinforced and
      illustrated. All participants will be taught techniques for monitoring PA behaviour, setting
      personalized goals to increase PA and reduce sedentary time, and strategies for overcoming
      challenges to PA participation. The one-to-one support calls will serve to reinforce the
      information provided during the group sessions, monitor safety, and troubleshoot any issues
      with the intervention content. All participants will undergo the assessment protocol again at
      12 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of the PAT-MS intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed weekly through study completion at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be recorded via reporting of adverse events (AEs) during testing sessions and one-on-one support calls. AEs will be defined as any unfavorable change in health that occurs in both PwMS and CGs during the trial period, e.g. injuries, relapses, falls and symptomatic changes. Each AE will be rated based on severity, expectedness, and potential relation to study participation using the Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) classification scheme. AEs will be reported as the overall rate, severity, and characteristics of the events.</description>
