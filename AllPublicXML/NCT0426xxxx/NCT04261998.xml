  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A service-learning programme in physiotherapy students will be performed. 30 physiotherapy
      students will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=15) or to a control group
      (n=15). Intervention group will perform a service-learning program with real patients with
      heart transplantation, and will have to perform a physical therapy program adapted to a real
      patient. Two meetings will be performed in order to establish groups, explain the project and
      search information based on evidence in scientific databases. In addition, three meetings
      with patients will be stated in order to establish the adapted program based on the real
      patient`s needs and characteristics. The control group will have to perform a physiotherapy
      program without meeting real patients.

      This study aims at determining the effect of a Service-Learning program on knowledge, ethical
      sensitivity and acquired transversal competences. On the other hand, we aim at evaluating the
      service performed, the skills acquired, the participation, the degree of participatory
      evaluation and the level of satisfaction of the intervention group. All variables will be
      measured with validated scales or questionnaires.

      Both groups will have to describe the specific characteristics of the program, different
      phases of the process, types of exercises recommended, contraindications, safety ranges with
      respect to the intensity of the exercise, ways of calculating the intensity and self-control.
      Likewise, they will have to defend the usefulness and duration of the final product through
      an oral presentation of the program to the patients themselves. Finally, the possible doubts
      that should exist will be solved.
