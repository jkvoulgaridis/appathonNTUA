    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the ability of Lucerno Dynamics Lara sensor when placed on the
      palpable carotid artery (or femoral artery) to monitor blood flow following the injection of
      18-FDG and to distinguish peak flow in tumor versus tissue uptake. Investigators will then
      assess if differences in tumor versus tissue correlates with tumor response.

      Primary Objective: To determine if Lara sensors placed over the carotid and femoral arteries
      can measure the plasma activity of 18 F-fludeoxyglucose (18-FDG) at time of injection and
      determine if that peak activity in the artery can be distinguished from peak activity in
      malignant tissue to provide enough information to obtain the arterial input function.

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate changes (baseline to post treatment) in tissue uptake at
      first pass (AUC and time to peak blood flow) and during the 60-minute period (metabolic
      activity) leading to the , positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This data is to be
      collected from the Lucerno Device placed over the carotid and femoral arteries monitoring 18
      F-fludeoxyglucose (18-FDG) activity in blood and malignant tissue throughout the pre positron
      emission tomography (PET) scan period.

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>If input function can be calculated on five (5) or more (out of 10) patients, then investigators will consider this a feasible procedure. Input function is calculated using time-activity curves (TAC) from the arterial blood flow detector and integrating the signal over time. Peak and minimum values of each of the four (4) Lara detector time-activity curves (TAC) will be recorded to determine a range of expected values and if they are different.</description>

    <measure>Change in Areas Under the Curve (AUC) Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 120 days after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use a repeated measures linear model with change in areas under the curve as the outcome and time from baseline and the baseline area under the curve as predictors. From the model investigators will report the estimated change at the post treatment Lara measurement. Participants should have three measurements of area under the curve (baseline, mid-treatment, 3-week measurement prior to PET scan).</description>

    <description>Four (4) sensors will be placed prior to the injection of 18 F-fludeoxyglucose (18FDG) at the following sites: 7 cm above injection site; injection site; surface of palpable presumed malignant tissue; palpable carotid artery.
Standard doses of 18-FDG will be injected per Department of Radiology protocols
All injections will be evaluated to insure the total dose of 18-FDG has been injected. Injections resulting in moderate to severe extravasations, as interpreted by Lara software, will be segregated and evaluated on an individual basis.
The sensors will remain in place for 60 minutes during the 18-FDG uptake period with the patient in a reclined chair.
After the uptake time is complete, the sensors will be removed by the technologist and the participant will be released.
The study team will then upload the sensor data to a personal computer in the treatment planning room where it will be coded and processed as a Lara scan.</description>
