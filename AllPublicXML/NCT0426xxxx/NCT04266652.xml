  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      assess and compare the efficacy and safety of autogenous tooth roots for lateral alveolar
      ridge augmentation with staged implant placement in comparison to autogenous bone block.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 14 patients in need of implant therapy and lateral ridge augmentation were
      allocated to parallel groups receiving either 1) healthy autogenous tooth roots (e.g.
      retained wisdom or impacted teeth or 2) cortical autogenous bone blocks harvested from the
      retromolar area. After 26 weeks of submerged healing the horizontal bone gain were assessed
      both clinically and radiographically. A core biopsy was taken during the implant placement to
      assess the histology of the newly formed bone.

    <description>In the first group, a second mucoperiosteal flap was elevated to surgically remove the respective wisdom tooth. After its removal and during the same surgery, the crown was decapitated at the cemento -enamel junction using a rotating carbide bur under gentle sterile saline cooling and the exposed pulp was preserved. The separated tooth root was adapted to match the size and shape of the defect area. To improve ankylosis between the graft and the defect site, the layer of cementum at the respective downward aspects of the root was carefully removed using a diamond bur until the underlying dentin was entirely exposed</description>
