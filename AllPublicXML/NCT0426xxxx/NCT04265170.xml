      A Multi-center, Prospective Clinical Trial Evaluating the Combination of BlastX and Negative
      Pressure Wound Therapy (VAC).To evaluate the 4-week healing trajectory/wound area reduction
      with BlastX/VAC as compared with historical pre-study 4-week healing trajectory data and data
      from the US Wound Registry.

      The study is a prospective, clinical trial designed to evaluate the combination of BlastX™
      and VAC® in facilitating healing and reduction in bio-burden in pressure ulcers. After
      consenting, the ulcers of eligible subjects are treated with BlastX. After a 5 minute dwell
      time the wound VAC® is applied as per manufacturers guidelines. The subjects return to the
      center three times per week for dressing changes and application of BlastX. The duration of
      the trial is four weeks. Subjects undergo study procedures (biopsy for quantitative tissue
      culture, photography, fluorescence imaging and swabbing for protease testing) on a weekly
      basis. The standard of care for pressure ulcers will be continued including debridement,
      off-loading, and nutritional supplementation when appropriate.
