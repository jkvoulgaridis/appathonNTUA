      This study tests whether changing the relative order of presentation of post acute care
      skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in the Repisodic application, i.e., presenting preferred
      SNFs (P-SNFs) first, increases selection of, and discharges to, P-SNFs and decreases lengths
      of stay (LoS) for Geisinger patients discharged to SNFs. Along with the order of P-SNFs, the
      study also assesses whether a short video reviewing the benefits of care coordination in
      P-SNFs increases patient election to transfer to one.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in acute-care facilities (hospitals) who are being discharged to post-acute care
      skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) currently struggle, in the absence of decision aids, to
      obtain practical information about SNFs to which the patients must be discharged. The same
      difficulties affect the attending case managers, social workers, and discharge planners.
      Moreover, although preferred SNF (P-SNF) networks offer patients the potential for improved
      coordination of care over non-preferred SNFs (NP-SNFs)—via shared staff across facilities and
      electronic sharing of information—this aspect of SNF selection is not highlighted or shared
      with patients according to any established protocol in the post-acute care setting.

      The Repisodic application is a technology platform, accessed via laptop, smart phone, or
      tablet, intended to provide a user-friendly approach to rapid SNF facility identification and
      selection, with information provided on facility amenities and details, quality ratings,
      distance, and fit for the patient's needs. It functions in a manner analogous to online
      consumer search/sort/filter/quality applications, allowing the discharge planner to build a
      curated list of discharge options matched to each patient's needs.

      The purpose of the current study is to test whether highlighting and changing the
      organization of, or information about, P-SNFs in the Repisodic app increases the selection
      of, and placements in, P-SNFs, while decreasing length of stay (LoS) at the discharging
      Geisinger acute care hospital. Our hypothesis is that presenting the P-SNF options at the top
      of the list (for case managers) and as the only options on the first screen or default map
      (for patients) will increase selection of and placement in P-SNFs, compared with the default
      ranking of SNFs (according to fit) in Repisodic. We also hypothesize that the P-SNF focused
      presentations will reduce LoS thanks to easier coordination between Geisinger hospitals and
      P-SNFs. A video describing the advantage of P-SNFs for care coordination will be available
      for optional viewing by patients across conditions. The video, when viewed, may enhance the
      appeal of P-SNFs in conditions in which they appear. Secondarily, we hypothesize an overall
      reduction in LoS (at the acute care hospital) due to the quicker decision making, selection,
      and transmission processes facilitated by the Repisodic application.

      The cluster-randomized trial study design will randomize case managers to one of two
      conditions (Default List vs. P-SNF Top-Sorted List) and patients to one of two conditions
      (Full List/Full Map vs. P-SNF List/P-SNF Map). Primary outcomes include P-SNF selection and
      P-SNF placement (six months post-introduction of Repisodic) and LoS (i.e., the change in LoS
      from six months prior to Repisodic to six months post-Repisodic). Secondary outcomes include
      patient time spent selecting a SNF on Repisodic. Generalized linear mixed models will be used
      to examine outcomes as a function of the conditions, accounting for patients nested within
      case managers and controlling for potential covariates and moderators at the patient, case
      manager, and discharging unit level. The findings will enhance our understanding of how
      patients' informed choice, as facilitated by a bedside decision tool, affects SNF choice.

    <intervention_model_description>Case managers (~145) will be randomly assigned to conditions in a cluster-randomized trial design:
Default List: all eligible SNF options presented in Repisodic in rank order.
P-SNF Top-Sorted List: same as Default List, except relevant P-SNFs will be shown at the top of the otherwise ranked list.
Patients (~3,000) will independently be randomized to conditions and tracked over a 6-month period:
Full List/Full Map: all SNF options preselected by case managers will be presented to patients in rank order. A map will present SNFs on the list if selected.
P-SNF List/P-SNF Map: same as Full List, except that both the list and map will present only the P-SNFs, with an opt-in button allowing patients to view all results. Moreover, the link to viewing the optional P-SNF advantage video will be highlighted.</intervention_model_description>
