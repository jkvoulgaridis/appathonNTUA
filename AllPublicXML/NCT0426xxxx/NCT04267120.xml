             cycle prior to starting study drugs, throughout the entire study period, and for 120
             days after the last dose of study drug, unless the male subjects are totally sexually
             abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy with confirmed azoospermia or
             unless the female partners have been sterilized surgically or are otherwise proven
             sterile.

          -  Archival tumor tissue or a newly obtained biopsy must be available prior to the first
             dose of study drug for biomarker analysis. In the case archival tissue cannot be
             provided, patients with inaccessible tumors for biopsy specimens can be enrolled
             without a biopsy upon consultation and agreement by the trial PI.

        Note: In case of submitting unstained cut slides, freshly cut slides should be submitted to
        the testing laboratory within 14 days from when the slides are cut.

          -  Subjects having &gt;1+ proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo 24-h urine collection for
             quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with urine protein ≥1 g/24-hour will
             be ineligible.

          -  Biologic response modifiers (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) within 4
             weeks before study entry. Chronic erythropoietin therapy is permitted provided that no

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e.,
             with use of disease modifying agents, &gt; 10 mg of prednisone per day, or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. The use of up to 10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent is approved and does not exclude the patient from the trial.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required maintenance steroids (&gt;10
             mg of prednisone) or current pneumonitis.
