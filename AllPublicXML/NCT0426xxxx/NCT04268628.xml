    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of HSD3B1 (1245C) germline
      variant and potential pharmacodynamic markers on abiraterone activity in participants with
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after unresponsive use of diethylstilbestrol.

    <description>Participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will be evaluated for genetic polymorphism and pharmacodynamic parameters from serum and plasma samples collected during the Abira-DES study (NCT02217566). Serum and plasma samples were collected after use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) and subsequent abiraterone acetate therapy. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to initiation of abiraterone acetate therapy, after 12 weeks of therapy, and at the time of disease progression (evaluated by prostate specific antigen [PSA] response).</description>
