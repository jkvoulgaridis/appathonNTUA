  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose chemotherapy and radiation used as preparative regimens in patients undergoing an
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) disrupts intestinal homeostasis by
      damaging the intestinal epithelium and altering the intestinal microbiome. The investigators
      hypothesize that 2'-fucosyllactose (2FL) supplementation will be safe and tolerable and
      result in an increase in the relative abundance of intestinal Bifidobacteria. The
      investigators also hypothesize that 2FL supplementation will lead to reduction of Firmicutes
      and/or Proteobacteria, and improved intestinal homeostasis at day+30 as measured by lower
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced levels of T-cell activation, lower markers of intestinal
      injury (fecal human DNA and plasma reg-3-alpha), increased fecal butyrate levels and
      ultimately lower incidence of acute GVHD and BSI at day+100.

      This phase I/IIa study is a single center prospective study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital
      Medical Center (CCHMC).

      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of various doses of 2FL. Eligible patients
      will be allocated to the following arms as determined by age at enrollment:

      Arm 1: 0-5 years; Arm 2: 5.1-10 years; Arm 3: &gt;10 years

      The investigators will enroll 5 patients of ages ≥10 years undergoing allogeneic HSCT. 2'-FL
      will be administered to these patients from day-7 until day+30 after HSCT at the starting
      dose. Once safety is determined the investigators will then enroll an additional 5 patients
      of ages 5-10 years and administer 2'FL to these patients at the proposed dose for this age
      group from day-7 to day+30 after HSCT. Once safety is determined, the investigators will
      enroll 5 patients of ages 0-5 years and administer 2'FL at starting doses to children from
      day-7 to day+30 after HSCT. Once safety is established in these patients we will proceed with
      the randomized portion of the study.

      Patients will be enrolled in each arm and randomized 1:1 to either receive 2FL or placebo (2
      g oral glucose). After 20 patients are enrolled at the first dose level for an arm,
      enrollment of that arm will be paused and all patients will be evaluated for safety and
      tolerability. The randomization for the 20 patients will be unblinded and the safety and
      tolerability of 2FL doses will be compared to placebo for that arm. If 6/10 patients can take
      80% of their planned doses, that dose level will be determined as tolerable and a dose
      escalation will be performed. If 5/10 patients are unable to take at least 80% of planned
      doses the dose will be determined to not be well tolerated and a dose de-escalation will be
      done.
