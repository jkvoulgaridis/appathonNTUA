  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and pilot test a research protocol to assess the
      influence of a health information behavior enhanced intervention on self-management, blood
      pressure control, and brain activity in African American women with hypertension. This work
      will identify characteristics of African American women that are associated with improved
      self-management and decreased blood pressure, and subsequent reduction of risk of heart
      disease and premature death. The results of this project will have direct impact in informing
      interventions to improve blood pressure control, by advancing our knowledge of brain activity
      associated with behavior change in African American women with hypertension in the
      metro-Detroit area, and ultimately everywhere.

    <description>intervention includes both analytic and socioemotional components related to self-management of hypertension and is specifically targeted to African American women. Along with providing education on lifestyle changes to lower blood pressure, DASH diet, exercise, and medication adherence (analytic components), the intervention is designed to promote social activities around blood pressure self-management, in particular, sharing blood pressure management information with peers (socioemotional components).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion criteria are (a) aged &gt;18, (b) clinically diagnosed with
        hypertension, and (c) right-handed (due to potential differences in brain morphology
        compared to left-handed individuals).

        -

        Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria are (a) history of renal insufficiency, (b) score
        less than 22 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and (c) having one of the
        following contraindications for fMRI: heart pacemaker, heart defibrillator, metal in the
        eye, and some types of metal elsewhere within the body such as certain surgical clips for
        aneurysms in the head, heart valve prostheses, electrodes, and some other implanted
        devices, pregnant. We require a score of &gt;22 on the MOCA to assure that subjects are able
        to participate cognitive procedures.
