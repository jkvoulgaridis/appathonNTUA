    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      comparison study of AT-5214 in subjects with moderate to severe primary palmar hyperhidrosis
      (sweaty palms). This study will compare two different oral (tablet) doses of AT-5214 (study
      drug) versus a matched placebo. Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled at approximately
      10 study sites.
