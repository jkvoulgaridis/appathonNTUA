    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I/Ib study is to determine the safety profile of NIZ985 (new
      formulation), and if it can be safely combined with Spartalizumab and to determine the
      appropriate dose and schedule for further study. Moreover, the study will characterize the
      pharmacokinetic profiles of NIZ985 as a single agent and in combination with Spartalizumab
      and identify preliminary anti-tumor activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/Ib, open-label, global, multi-center study of subcutaneously administered
      NIZ985 alone and in combination with Spartalizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors and
      lymphoma who have progressed after obtaining a previous response to anti-PD-1/ Check Point
      Inhibitor (CPI) therapy.

      The study consists of two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. Two separate arms will
      be examined during the escalation portion: 1) evaluation of NIZ985 as a single agent.
      Spartalizumab may be added at the time of the first disease re-evaluation and 2)
      administration of NIZ985 and Spartalizumab as a combination starting from Cycle 1Day 1.

                  expansion but not in escalation.

               -  Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy. Patients requiring systemic
                  antibiotics for infection must have completed treatment before screening is
                  initiated.

          9. Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I
             diabetes, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not
             requiring systemic treatment or conditions not expected to recur may be considered.
             Patients previously exposed to CPI treatment who were adequately treated for skin rash
             or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.

         10. History of or current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis grade ≥ 2.

         11. Radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study drug, except for palliative
             radiotherapy to a limited field. To allow evaluation for response to treatment,
             patients enrolled in the expansion must have remaining measurable disease that has not
             been irradiated.

         12. Treatment with cytotoxic or targeted antineoplastics within 3 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment. For cytotoxic agents that have major delayed toxicities, a washout
             period of one cycle is indicated (examples are nitrosoureas and mitomycin C which
             typically require a 6 week washout). Prior antibodies or immunotherapies require a 4
             week washout. Ongoing bisphosphonate therapy and growth hormone-releasing hormone
             (GHRH) agonist therapy is allowed. Supportive therapy with denosumab is allowed. For
             patients with lymphoma, the following washout criteria may be used:

             • Systemic antineoplastic therapy (including cytotoxic chemotherapy, alfa-interferon,
             kinase inhibitors or other targeted small molecules, and toxin immunoconjugates) or
             any experimental therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, before
             the first dose of study treatment

         13. Presence of Grade ≥ 2 toxicity according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), from prior cancer therapy with
             the exception of neuropathy (inclusion of patients with neuropathy of Grade 2 or less
             is permitted), ototoxicity, and alopecia.

         14. Two weeks since major surgery treatment (mediastinoscopy, insertion of a central
             venous access device and insertion of a feeding tube are not considered major surgery)

         15. Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases within 4 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment.

         16. Use of hematopoietic growth factors or transfusion support ≤ 2 weeks prior to start of
             study treatment. If growth factors were initiated more than 2 weeks prior to the first
             dose of study treatment and the patient is on a stable dose, they can be maintained.

         17. Any medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgement, prevent the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns, compliance with
             clinical study procedures, or interpretation of study results.

         18. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

         19. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             while taking study medication and for 150 days after stopping medication. Highly
             effective methods of contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking investigational drug(s). In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject

               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected, or implanted hormonal methods
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine
                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                  hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

             NOTE: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
             have had over 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
             clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate [generally age from 40 to 59 years], history of
             vasomotor symptoms [e.g. hot flush]) in the absence of other medical justification or
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy
             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
             hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         20. A condom is required for all sexually active male participants to prevent them from
             fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to
             their partner. Sexually active males receiving NIZ985 as a single agent or in
             combination with Spartalizumab must use a condom during intercourse for 30 days after
             their last dose of NIZ985. In addition, male participants must not donate sperm for 30
             days after the last dose of NIZ985. Patients should not father a child during this
             post treatment period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as
             well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the
             drug via semen.
