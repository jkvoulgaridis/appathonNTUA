  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children suffering from neurological problems may have a common problem of drooling and
      dysphagia.There is high prevelance of neurological disorders in developing countries
      including Pakistan.Parents of children with disability are highly stressed and burdenised
      while taking care of their children.there is a need to overcome the drooling and dysphagia
      problems with effective interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear consensus that which interventions are safe and effective and hard to
      decide about the effective intervention for drooling management. This will help the parents,
      therapist and children to manage their feeding problems effectively, hence improve quality of
      life of parents and children.There is also scarcity of well designed randomized controlled
      trails and limited published literature on the usefulness of the kinesiotape for management
      of drooling in children with oral dysphagia, this study will be conducted in an attempt to
      evaluate the same. There is also a lack of comparative studies to evaluate the effectiveness
      of traditional oral motor therapies and kinesiotaping therapy.

      speech pathologists and help them in managing drooling effectively by using the best
      effective therapeutic approach. This study will also add up evidence-based knowledge to
      existing literature

    <description>Protocols mentioned in kinesiological taping i.e. 45 minutes will be pursued as with longer sessions children may tire out easily. Taping Technique for lip muscles would be used by cutting 2 &quot;I&quot; tapes according to the structure of lip muscles.The tape will be fixed in the center of the mouth on the upper lip, will be placed on an open mouth and a 10% tension will be given to the paper. The tape will then end at the corner of the upper lip. Kinesiotape wouldn't be placed on the lips. The second tape piece will be fixed to the center of the lower lip.The edges of the tape should overlap slightly.
The other piece of tape will be placed under chin (base of tongue) on sub mandibular triangle, inside the jaw line on the base of the tongue. A strip 1-1 ½ inch long will be cut, and then will further be cut in half such that the stretch is horizontal. It will be anchored in the middle on sub mandibular triangle. Paper off the tension to both sides.</description>

    <description>For the oral motor manipulation technique CP chair will be required to maintain the good sitting posture of children. Trunk will be in upright position with cut out lap board of the CP chair. Hips, knees and ankles would be flexed to 90 degrees. Shoulders and arms will be rested in symmetrical manner by keeping them rested in lap board and foot rest will be used to rest the feet tightly to control movement and maintain good posture. Each child would be taken for 12 weeks of therapy with three sessions per day of 15 minutes each. Oral motor manipulation like tapping protocols would be used for 45 minutes; slow, even rhythmic pressure will be applied around lip muscle and base of tongue muscle, keeping in view the comfort level of patient.
Training to do manipulation exercises will be given to the parents of children with CP at .</description>
