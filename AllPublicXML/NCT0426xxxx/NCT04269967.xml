  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the leading cancer affecting women in Singapore. Breast cancer survivors
      commonly experience declined physical function and quality of life, due to their upper limb
      morbidity and wound issues post-surgery. Rehabilitation therapy can address the
      aforementioned issues that the survivors may experience during their recovery. No therapy
      however, can be effective if patients do not utilize them. Home-based telehealth (e.g.,
      tele-rehabilitation) self-managed by patients and guided by healthcare professionals can
      potentially improve the service use and recovery. This study aims to understand the lived
      experience of post-mastectomy tele-rehabilitation and recovery process among female patients
      who undergo a unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer.
