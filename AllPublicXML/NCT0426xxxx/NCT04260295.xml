  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest incidence, accounting for the first cause
      of tumor death. At present, smoking, occupational and environmental exposure, air pollution
      and genetic factors are considered to be related to the incidence of lung cancer. However,
      the occurrence of cancer is related to many factors. In recent years, researches have found
      that microorganisms are closely related to various human cancers. It is reported that 20% of
      cancers are related to multiple microorganisms, such as EB virus and nasopharyngeal cancer,
      HBV and liver cancer. Understanding the correlation between pathogenic microorganisms and
      cancer is of great significance for the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of cancer.
      Basic researches have found that mycotoxins are related to animal models of lung cancer, but
      have not been confirmed in clinical and human.

      With the help of microbial metagenome Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) and bioinformatics
      analysis, the investigators initially found in clinical practice that some patients had
      fungal infections such as fungi in lung cancer tissues. This study intends to collect
      clinical cases (cross-sectional studies) to explore the correlation between the pathogenic
      microbiome and lung cancer, in order to confirm that the occurrence of lung cancer is closely
      related to microorganisms such as fungi.

      The investigator designe a cross-sectional study to explore the correlation between the
      pathogenic microbiome and lung cancer, and to understand the specific pathogen distribution
      of the &quot;lung cancer microbiome&quot; in order to provide new ideas and strategies for the
      pathogenesis and prevention of lung cancer.

      The subjects of this study are patients with lung shadow confirmed by CT-guided percutaneous
      lung biopsy. Lung shadows usually refer to high-density areas found in the parenchymal areas
      of the lungs on radiographs or radiographs, and often appear on CT as exudation,
      consolidation, masses, or nodules. Lung shadows mainly include infectious diseases of the
      lung, Tumors and interstitial lung diseases. The subjects are patients who cannot be
      diagnosed by conventional non-invasive testing methods (including blood, sputum and other
      specimens) and bronchoscopy, and the patients need to be diagnosed and treated as soon as
      possible (such as lung tumors, lung infections and other diseases ). Obtaining pathological
      and etiology of lung lesion tissue for examination is a necessary and effective diagnostic
      measure. Part of the biopsy tissue will be submitted for pathology and immunohistochemical
      detection, and the other part will be submitted for microbial mNGS detection.

      Pulmonary shadow cases include lung cancer and non-lung cancer patients, which are intended
      to be included in 300 cases. According to the previous lung shadow patients admitted to
      respiratory department in Huashan Hospital, it is estimated that about 100 lung cancer
      patients and 200 non-lung cancer patients will be included, respectively.

      Observation indicators in this study include histopathology of lung puncture biopsy, and
      next-generation sequencing of microorganisms in lung puncture biopsy.Baseline screening
      includes demographic data, medical history, combined medication records, symptoms, signs,
      electrocardiogram, lung function, and safety observation indicators. All patients will be
      followed up for 1 week for a total of three times, including baseline follow-up, 24 hours
      after lung puncture, and 1 week after lung puncture.
