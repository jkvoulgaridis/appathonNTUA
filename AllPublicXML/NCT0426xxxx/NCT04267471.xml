  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies investigating Tai Chi for hypertension have been carried out. However,
      investigators found the results were in high heterogeneity and poor methodological quality.
      Thus, investigators intend to provide high quality of the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi
      for essential hypertension.
