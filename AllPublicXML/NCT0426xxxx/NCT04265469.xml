      The universe of this randomized controlled study consisted of 130 patients who had presented
      to a training and research hospital in Istanbul. The data were collected during the period
      March-September 2017 with an Information Form, the Diabetic Foot Knowledge Scale, Diabetic
      Foot Care Self-efficacy Scale, Foot Self-care Behavior Scale and a Feedback Form on the
      Mobile Application Training.

    <description>Diabetic Foot Care Self-efficacy Scale is a scale that determines a diabetic individual's perception of self-efficacy with respect to executing diabetic foot care activities. Responses to this nine-item 10-point Likert-type of questionnaire are assessed on a visual scale that ranges from &quot;I'm absolutely unsure=0&quot; to &quot;I'm very sure=10&quot;. The lowest possible score on the scale is 0; the highest is 100.</description>

    <description>Diabetes Foot Knowledge Questionnaire (DFKQ) were developed by Garcia et al. as a 5-item instrument that assesses the level of knowledge patients have about foot care. The questionnaire is evaluated on the basis of the total score. An increase in the score indicates that the diabetic individual has an increased level of knowledge about foot care</description>

    <description>Foot Self-care Behavior Scale assesses self-efficacy behavior in the context of foot care. It is a 16-item 5-point Likert-type of scale in which responses are assessed as &quot;I do this: 1=Never, 2=Occasionally, 3=Sometimes, 4=Frequently, 5=Always.&quot; The lowest possible score on the scale is 16; the highest is 80</description>
