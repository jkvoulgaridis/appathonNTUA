  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of RT234 on exercise parameters
      assessed by a specialized exercise test (Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test or CPET) in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consequences of pulmonary arterial hypertension are significant limitations in
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), exercise capacity, as well as profound dyspnea with physical
      exertion. The objective of the present study is to assess the ability of a single inhaled
      dose of RT234 to acutely improve primary CPET measures of CRF and exercise capacity, and to
      lower the sensation of dyspnea with physical exertion compared to baseline CPET measures.
