      To compare the effectiveness of an interactive mobile chatbot and traditional decision aid
      booklets to enhance informed decisions made by cataract patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is the only way to treat age-related cataract. For patients at early or
      moderate stages, cataract surgery is an elective surgery without objective indications.
      Therefore, patients are uaually not aware whether they should receive the surgery or not. In
      clinical practice, traditional Patient Decision Aids (PDAs) booklets are used to provide
      health education to patients. However, PDAs lack real-time interaction with patients, and are
      unable to answer the new questions raised. Patients still have doubts about whether they
      should receive cataract surgery or not. In this study, the investigators aim to assess the
      effectiveness of an interactive Q&amp;A mobile application based on natural language processing
      technology to enhance informed decisions made by cataract patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Informed choice about cataract surgery (the proportion of participants who make an informed choiceï¼Œwhich is defined as a good knowledge score and an intention that is consistent with their attitude score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Informed choice is an aggregated measure of multiple measurements, including:
Knowledge (a 12-item questionnaire that assesses conceptual knowledge of cataract and cataract surgery). Questions with right answers will earn 1 point otherwise 0 point. Each participant may get 12 points maximally and 0 point minimally.
Attitudes (6 items, with 5 responses for each. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively);
Intentions (single item with 5 responses. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively).
Higher scores indicate a better knowledge on informed choice of cataract surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived importance of surgical benefit/harms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Purpose-developed items will be used to ask participants about their personal perceptions of the importance of specific outcomes in their decision-making about cataract surgery. The questionare contains 2 items with 5 responses. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively).
Higher scores indicate a better knowledge on the understanding of importance of surgical benefit/harms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived personal chances of surgical benefit/harms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about their perceived personal likelihood of experiencing specific outcomes if they have cataract surgeries. The questionare contains 2 items with 5 responses. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively). Higher scores indicate a better knowledge on the understanding of personal chances of surgical benefit/harms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional conflict will be assessed using a 16-item Decisional Conflict Scale. Each item has 5 responses. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively. Lower scores indicate a stronger ability to decide wheter or not receiving a cataract surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional confidence will be assessed using a 11-item Decision Self Efficacy Scale. Each item has 5 responses. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively. Higher scores indicate the paricipant is more confident about his/her decision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time perspective</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using a 4-item short form of the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale, with five response categories ranging from strongly agree (4 points) to strongly disagree (0 point). Higher scores indicate more consideration of future consequences by the participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anticipated regret</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Two items from a validated scale will measure anticipated regret about having cataract surgery (action regret, 4 points) and about not having cataract (inaction regret, 0 point). Higher scores indicate higher probability of anticipated regret after the surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Utilization and acceptability of decision aid</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability and utilization of materials (chatbot/traditional booklet) will be assessed based on the following items:
the proportion of participants who could read the information all the way through;
the proportion of participants who agree that the information is new;
the proportion of participants who agree that the length is just about right;
the proportion of participants who think the information is balanced;
the proportion of participants who agree that the information is clear and easy to understand;
the proportion of participants who find the information helpful;
the proportion of participants who feel it worth recommending to others.
Each item has 5 responses. Each response will earn 0-4 points respectively. Higher scores indicate better acceptability and utiliation of the materials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cataract worry</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A validated single item will measure participants' level of worry about progression of cataract, using four verbal response categories ranging from not worried at all to very worried. There are five response categories ranging from strongly agree (3 points) to strongly disagree (0 point). Higher scores indicate more worried about the disease status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cataract anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured with a six-item short form.A validated single item will measure participants' level of worry about progression of cataract, using four verbal response categories ranging from not worried at all to very worried. Each question has five response categories ranging from strongly agree (3 points) to strongly disagree (0 point). Higher scores indicate more anxious about the disease status.</description>
