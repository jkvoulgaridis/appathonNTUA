  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is more common after a spinal cord injury (SCI) than in the general population.
      Unfortunately, it is unknown how depression is typically treated in individuals with SCI or
      if commonly used treatment methods are effective. This study will investigate the safety and
      impact of a novel method for treating depression called repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation. Fourteen individuals
      with a cervical or thoracic level SCI and depression will complete an approved treatment plan
      using rTMS. Participants will be treated using rTMS five days a week for four weeks. After
      four weeks of treatment, the study team will review the safety of rTMS and assess changes in
      depressive symptoms. If the results are positive, larger studies can be designed to develop
      better treatment options for individuals with SCI and depression.
