    <textblock>
      This Phase I/IIa trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of CyPep-1 when administered directly into malignant tumors. Additionally,
      the trial will monitor anti-tumor effects on both injected lesions and distant non-injected
      deposits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with immune modulating agents may result in long lasting anti-tumor responses in
      patients with cancer. However, only a subset of patients obtains durable remission. Treatment
      strategies that aim at recruiting tumor antagonizing cellular components of the immune system
      holds great promise. CyPep-1 is a chemically synthesized peptide with oncolytic properties.
      It selectively targets cancer cells based on their altered molecular composition, and removes
      the surrounding cell membrane. This releases tumor neoantigens to the microenvironment and
      potentially induces an anti-tumour immune response.

      This is a phase I/IIa dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      CyPep-1 and identify the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives are preliminary
      anti-tumor efficacy and to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CyPep-1

         16. Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis that is symptomatic or progressing or that
             requires current therapy (e.g., evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastasis or new
             neurological symptoms attributable to CNS metastasis).

         17. QTcF &gt; 480 ms, history of long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, or known
