  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is the number one risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases. There are no
      pharmaceutical treatments to slow aging and prolong healthspan. The anti-diabetic drug
      metformin is considered a likely pharmaceutical candidate to slow aging. In this study, the
      investigators hypothesize that metformin treatment in subjects free of type 2 diabetes will
      improve insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin resistant individuals, but will
      decrease insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin sensitive subjects. Further, the
      investigators hypothesize that long-term metformin treatment will remodel mitochondria in a
      way that decreases mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin sensitive, but
      improves mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin resistant. The investigators
      will use a dual-site, 12- week drug intervention trial performed in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled manner on 148 subjects recruited from two separate sites (Oklahoma Medical
      Research Foundation (OMRF) and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)). After consent
      and initial subject screening for chronic disease, subjects will be stratified to insulin
      sensitive (IS) or insulin resistant (IR) groups. Over a 12- week intervention, half of each
      group will take metformin and half will take a placebo. Pre- and post--intervention, subjects
      will complete a series of procedures to assess insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and
      biomarkers of aging. The same subjects will provide a skeletal muscle biopsy pre-- and
      post-intervention to assess the change in mitochondrial function and mitochondrial remodeling
      with and without metformin treatment. By completion of this project, the investigators expect
      to provide evidence that helps further delineate who may benefit from metformin treatment to
      slow aging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is epidemiological support for health benefits of metformin in patient
      populations, it is not clear if these protective effects extend to those free of disease.
      Therefore, there is a need to perform human studies determining which subjects free of
      chronic disease benefit from metformin treatment. Retrospective analysis of a randomized,
      double-blinded clinical trial in our lab revealed that subjects who were insulin sensitive
      had no effect or negative effects on insulin sensitivity when taking metformin during an
      exercise training program. These data suggest that in some subjects, metformin has
      detrimental metabolic outcomes that could accelerate aging. There are data both in support of
      and refuting that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I action and/or mitochondrial
      remodeling. The overall objective of this trial is to determine if subjects currently free of
      disease benefit from metformin treatment. There are two critical questions that remain
      unanswered in human subjects: 1) does antecedent metabolic health influence responses to
      metformin, and 2) does long-term treatment with metformin lead to mitochondrial remodeling
      and changes in function. To better understand the translational potential of a clinically
      relevant dose of metformin for the prevention of chronic conditions, this proposal aims to
      determine how antecedent metabolic health affects the response to metformin treatment, and
      identify the relationship between skeletal muscle mitochondrial remodeling and mitochondrial
      function with metformin treatment. The hypotheses are that: 1) metformin treatment in
      subjects free of Type 2 diabetes will improve insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in
      insulin resistant individuals, but will decrease insulin sensitivity and glucoregulation in
      insulin sensitive subjects, and 2) long-term metformin treatment will remodel mitochondria in
      a way that decreases mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin sensitive, but
      improves mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin resistant. To test these
      hypotheses, a 12-week randomized, double-blind clinical trial will be performed in subjects
      40-75 yrs of age, free of disease, and stratified by insulin sensitivity (insulin sensitive
      and insulin resistant). Pre- and post-training assessments include the hyperinsulinemic-
      euglycemic clamp to measure hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, continuous glucose
      monitoring to determine glucoregulation, and proposed blood-based biomarkers of aging.
      Further, the use of novel stable isotope labeling with proteomic analysis will determine
      individual and complex-specific mitochondrial remodeling. This approach will be combined with
      analysis of protein modification and turnover to comprehensively analyze mitochondrial
      effects of metformin treatment in skeletal muscle. By completion of this project, it is
      expected that there will be evidence that helps further delineate who may benefit from
      metformin treatment to slow aging.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial of healthy older male and female subjects 40-75 years of age. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups (metformin or placebo) for a 12-week intervention. The study is double-blinded on placebo versus metformin. The randomization sequence will be stratified by study center (OUHSC or UIUC) and baseline insulin status (HOMA-IR &lt;=2.2 [sensitive] versus &gt;=2.5 [resistant]) and will be created using randomly chosen block sizes of four or six. At each center, there will be four groups: insulin sensitive (IS) placebo, IS metformin, insulin resistant (IR) placebo, and IR metformin.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The investigators use a &quot;ramp up&quot; dosing protocol in which the amount of metformin (Hunter Pharmacy) will begin at 500 mg/day in week 1, increase to 1000 mg/day in week 2, and then to 1500 mg/day in week 3, as tolerated. At week 3 and for the remaining 9 weeks, the dose will remain at 1500 mg/day, which is a standard clinical dose (1500-2000 mg/day). If a subject has gastrointestinal discomfort with 1500 mg/day the dose, the investigators will lower the dose to 1000 mg/day. The investigators will split the dose with 1/2 given in the a.m. and 1/2 in the p.m. and taken with meals to minimize GI discomfort.</description>
