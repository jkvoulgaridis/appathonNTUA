  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet therapies are important to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) through the prevention of thrombus formation. Aspirin (ASA)
      is a readily available and affordable antiplatelet medication that can help reduce adverse
      cardiovascular events by up to 25%. However, 25-60% of PAD patients are &quot;ASA insensitive&quot;
      having a lower than normal ability to inhibit platelet aggregation after standard aspirin
      dosing. In a previous study conducted by our lab, we were able to demonstrate a methodology
      for personalizing antiplatelet therapy using two platelet function tests, Platelet Function
      Analyzer-100 (PFA 100) and Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA). To investigate this
      methodology further, we would like to conduct a pilot study on two cohorts of patients, one
      population continuing with their current medications (81mg ASA), and a second group who will
      get personalized antiplatelet therapy using our methodology (81-325mg ASA). In this study,
      150 PAD patients taking 81mg Aspirin therapy presenting for clinical follow-up, or in-patient
      intervention, in vascular clinics or the emergency room, will be recruited to our study. 75
      patients will be randomly assigned undergo platelet analysis using PFA-200 and LTA, and will
      have their antiplatelet therapy personalized. Patients will then be followed up in order to
      see if the patients with personalized therapy have better platelet inhibition. This study
      will allow us to help personalize antiplatelet therapy in PAD patients, allowing for better
      patient outcomes and decreased adverse cardiovascular events.
