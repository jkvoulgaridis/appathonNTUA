      This is a single center, single arm, open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells in patients with refractory and relapsed B-cell
      lymphoma.

      This Phase I study is designed as a pilot trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cell therapy in subjects with refractory and relapsed B cell lymphoma.
      Subjects will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on
      days -5, -4 and -3 followed by infusion of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells. Safety and efficacy of
      CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to
      determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells therapy in patients
      with refractory and relapsed B-cell lymphoma.
