  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a low-dose ketamine infusion on
      depression symptoms within the Emergency Department (ED) visit, and healthcare utilization
      after leaving the ED, when administered in the ED for depression or suicidal ideation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified based on either a chief complaint of suicidal ideation, suicide
      attempt, or severe depression, or if the patient indicates during intake assessment that they
      have thoughts of harming or killing their self. Identified patients will be assessed by the
      ED provider for inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is a candidate for the trial
      and gives their informed consent for enrollment, they will be randomized to receive either
      ketamine or placebo by a computer program that maintains blinding. The patient will be
      assessed by psychiatry for disposition and treatment plan prior to receiving the study drug,
      and will be reassessed four hours after the infusion. Thirty days after the patient leaves
      the hospital (either leaves from the ED or is discharged from inpatient admission), they will
      be contacted to follow up on their healthcare utilization after discharge.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Symptom Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be classified as a responder or non-responder, with a response defined as a decrease by 50% or greater for the combined depressive symptom scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), which includes the following domains: emotional withdrawal, guilt feelings, depressed mood, blunted affect, feelings of inferiority, and suicidal ideation. The total depressive symptom score ranges from 6-42, with a higher score indicating a higher level of severity. Response rate will be compared between the treatment and placebo groups.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days from discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be contacted at 30 days from discharge to obtain outpatient follow-up data. The two results for this outcome are &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to having at least one outpatient visit, either with a psychiatry provider or with a primary care provider to obtain psychiatric care. The number of outpatient visits an individual patient reports, if greater than one, does not affect this outcome. Attempts will be made to confirm each reported visit with the provider to minimize the potential for subject bias.</description>
