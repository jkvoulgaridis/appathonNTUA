      This is an open label, single-center, non-randomized clinical trial on utilization of
      microbiome as biomarkers and therapeutics in immuno-oncology.

      This research consists of two parts:

      part 1: development of microbiome biomarkers for immuno-oncology part 2: proof-of-concept
      trial on the fecal microbiota transplantation in patients who are being treated with
      immunotherapy for advanced solid tumor
