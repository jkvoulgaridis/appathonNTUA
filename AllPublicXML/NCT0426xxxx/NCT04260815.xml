  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct-current
      stimulation (tDCS) for rehabilitation of language is a growing field that needs further
      studies to determine how best it can be used to enhance treatment outcomes. It has been shown
      that tDCS can improve language performance in healthy and brain-injured individuals such as
      increased naming accuracy.

      However, at present, it is not known what effect tDCS has on higher-level language skills
      like discourse production (i.e. story telling, giving instructions) in healthy, older
      speakers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate in healthy older adults, the
      effect of tDCS on discourse production as well as the ideal tDCS electrode placement for
      improving language at the discourse level. It is hypothesised that tDCS will result in
      greater language changes and improvements during discourse production compared to no
      stimulation.

    <description>HADS is a 14-item scale which assesses non-somatic anxiety and depression symptoms experienced in the past week. Scores range from 0 to 21 for each sub-scale with a score â‰¥8 proposed for the identification of caseness, for both depression and anxiety.</description>

    <description>The EPAQ2 is a self completed questionnaire which collects information on a person's physical activity levels at home, work and recreation. Based on total activity hours in the last 12 months, the physical activity index categorises levels of physical activity into 'active', 'moderately inactive', 'moderately active' or 'active'.</description>

    <measure>The Keele Assessment of Participation (KAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The KAP is a short questionnaire that measures participation levels in various activities such as activities of daily living, social activities and work in the last 4 weeks. A score of 0 indicates no restriction in participation whereas scores from 1-11 indicate a restriction in participation in at least one activity ( the higher the score the greater the restriction).</description>

    <description>Transcranial direct-current stimulation is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that can modify spontaneous cortical activity in targeted brain regions. Anodal tDCS delivered through a positively charged electrode has been found to increase cortical excitability in a targeted brain region. Application of tDCS has been found to improve language production in healthy and brain-injured speakers.</description>
