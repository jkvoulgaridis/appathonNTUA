  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) chemotherapy induces only low CR/VGPR (Complete
      Remission/ Very Good Partial Response) rates and responses of short duration compared to
      other indolent lymphomas. Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent
      activity and tolerability in WM. Chemotherapy-free approaches are highly attractive for this
      patient group. Based on its high activity in WM and its low toxicity, Ibrutinib was approved
      for the treatment of WM by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, also Ibrutinib fails
      to induce CRs and the VGPR rate is 16% in relapsed patients. In addition, activity of
      Ibrutinib depends on the genotype: compared to MYD88mut/CXCR4WT patients Ibrutinib single
      agent therapy induces substantially lower response rates in patients with the
      MYD88mut/CXCR4mut or the MYD88WT/CXCR4WT genotype (major response (at least PR) in 91.7 %
      compared to 61.9 and 0 %, respectively). Phase II data have indicated that the proteasome
      inhibitor Carfilzomib is able to overcome the inferior prognosis of Ibrutinib in
      MYD88mut/CXCR4mut and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT patients, as response rates were high for all genotypes
      in a phase II study combining Carfilzomib with Rituximab and Dexamethasone. Based on this the
      investigators hypothesize that addition of Carfilzomib to Ibrutinib will increase the VGPR/CR
      rate compared to Ibrutinib alone in patients with WM, in particular in patients carrying the
      CXCR4 mutation. In addition, the investigators hypothesize, that the combination Carfilzomib
      and Ibrutinib will be also highly active in MYD88 wildtype patients and that this combination
      will be at least as efficient in treatment naïve patients as in relapsed/refractory patients.

      In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) conventional chemotherapy induces only low Complete
      Remission (CR) rates and responses of short duration compared to other indolent lymphomas.
      Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in
      patients with WM, who are mostly of advanced age. Today, chemotherapy in combination with the
      anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab is still the backbone of treatment in patients with WM and is
      recommended as first line in national and international treatment guidelines.With the
      approval of Ibrutinib by the EMA 2015 for patients with relapsed WM or for patients not
      eligible for chemotherapy with treatment naïve WM treatment landscape has changed in this
      lymphoma subtype and there is an urgent need to evaluate to which extent chemotherapy-free
      approaches add clinical benefit to the patient. Based on its high activity in WM and its low
      toxicity, Ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of WM by the EMA. However, also Ibrutinib
      fails to induce CRs and the VGPR (Very Good Partial Response) rate is 16% in relapsed
      patients. In addition, activity of Ibrutinib depends on the genotype with inferior response
      rates in MYD88mut/CXCR4mut patients and in patients with unmutated MYD88 and CXCR4 compared
      to MYD88mut/CXCR4WT patients (major response (at least PR) in 91.7 % compared to 61.9 and 0
      %, respectively). Phase II data have indicated that the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib is
      able to overcome the inferior prognosis of Ibrutinib in MYD88mut/CXCR4mut and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT
      patients, as response rates were high for all genotypes in a phase II study combining
      Carfilzomib with Rituximab and Dexamethasone. Based on this the investigators hypothesize
      that addition of Carfilzomib to Ibrutinib will increase the VGPR/CR rate compared to
      Ibrutinib alone in patients with WM, in particular in patients carrying the CXCR4 mutation.
      In addition, the investigators hypothesize, that the combination Carfilzomib and Ibrutinib
      will be also highly active in MYD88 wildtype patients and that this combination will be at
      least as efficient in treatment naïve patients as in relapsed/refractory patients.

      The study is an international, phase III, multicenter, open label and randomized trial
      comparing Carfilzomib in combination with Ibrutinib (treatment Arm A) versus Ibrutinib
      (treatment arm B) in male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years of de novo and
      relapsed/refractory WM in need of treatment.

      The phase III study will consist of an open labeled, stratified 1:1 randomization between Arm
      A and Arm B. Stratification factors are MYD88 and CXCR4 status (positive vs. negative) and
      number of prior lines (0 vs. ≥ 1 treatment lines). A stratified central block randomization
      will be used.

      The primary objective of the trial is to test the efficacy and toxicity of Carfilzomib and
      Ibrutinib in patients with treatment naïve or relapsed WM.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the rate of CR or VGPR 12 months after the start of
      treatment using the response criteria updated at the Sixth IWWM (CR/VGPR).

      184 patients at approximately 60 investigator sites will be recruited. Patients will be
      followed up after end of treatment. Patients will receive Ibrutinib in both treatment arms
      until progression, non-tolerated toxicity or until the study duration has reached its maximum
      of 10 years after the first patient was included into the trial. Follow-up (5 years or until
      disease progression for patients who discontinue treatment due to toxicity) or survival
      follow-up (for patients with progression disease) will be performed until the study duration
      has reached its maximum of 10 years after the first patient was included into the trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in this
        study:

          -  Proven clinicopathological diagnosis of WM as defined by consensus panel one of the
             Second International Workshop on WM. Histopathology has to occur before randomization
             within the last 4 months. In addition, pathological specimens have to be sent to the
             national pathological reference center prior to randomization for the determination of
             the mutational status of MYD88 and CYCR4. Immunophenotyping will be performed in each
             center and saved locally. The positivity for CD20 can be assumed from any previous
             bone marrow immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry analysis performed up to 4 months
             prior to enrollment. Flow cytometry of bone marrow and blood cells will include at
             least one double staining and assess the expression of the following antigens: surface
             immunoglobulin, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10, CD38 and CD23. Patients are eligible if tumor
             cells express the following antigens: CD19, CD20, CD38 and if they are negative for
             CD5, CD10 and CD23 expression. Patients with tumor cells positive for CD5 and/or CD23
             and morphologically similar to WM cells may be included after ruling out other
             low-grade B-cell malignancies.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use a highly effective method of
             birth control for the duration of the therapy up to 6 months after end of therapy. A
             highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as

             understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without
             prejudice to future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrolment:
