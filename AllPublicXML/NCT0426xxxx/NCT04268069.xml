      The clinical trial is a Phase 2, multi center, randomized, double masked and placebo
      controlled study.

      During a 14-day study run-in period (for the purpose of subject selection) prior to
      randomization, all subjects will receive Placebo Ophthalmic Solution (vehicle) bilaterally.
      During the screening period, exposure to the CAE® will be conducted to ascertain eligibility
      to enter the study at Visit 1 and Visit 2. Those who qualify at Visit 2 will be randomized to
      receive study drug in a double-masked fashion for 12 weeks. The CAE® exposure will occur at
      all Visits.
