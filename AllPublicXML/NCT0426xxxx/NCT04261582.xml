  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD) is a relatively homogeneous disease
      characterized by adult-onset severe asthma, development of non-cancerous growths in the nasal
      canal (i.e. nasal polyps) and aspirin allergy. The cause of AERD is unknown, although likely
      results from environmental insults in combination with genetic susceptibility. AERD disease
      homogeneity increases the possibility of discovering narrowly-defined genetic contributors,
      and makes it an ideal population to study the genetic and epigenetic changes that cause
      asthma. Researchers recently discovered that gene expression of epithelial growth and repair
      (EGR) genes are substantially decreased in bronchial airway epithelial cells of severe
      asthmatics compared to less severe asthmatics and healthy controls. This new finding
      indicates that epithelial integrity and related processes may be of primary importance to the
      development of severe asthma, and potentially the severe asthma subtype, AERD. This finding
      was later supported in a subsequent lab model, which showed that blocking a central
      epithelial repair and differentiation gene, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2),
      decreased healing time of bronchial epithelial cells after injury. Thus, the objective of the
      proposed study is to determine whether EGR gene are also down-regulated in AERD, a
      homogeneous severe asthma subtype. As an extension, the researchers will also determine
      whether genetic mutations and/or epigenetic changes relate to and potentially explain this
      down-regulation of EGR genes. Specifically, the researchers plan to obtain gene expression of
      freshly brushed nasal airway epithelial cells of 140 AERD patients, 70 non-aspirin sensitive
      asthma patients, and 35 healthy controls, noting that nasal epithelial gene expression has
      recently been shown to mirror lung epithelial changes in asthmatic airways. Swabbing the
      nasal canal for epithelial cells allows to evaluate airway epithelial cell gene expression
      non-invasively. Our experimental design contrasts AERD gene expression profiles against
      healthy controls, and determines whether EGR genes are depressed in AERD relative to health
      controls. As a corollary, the researchers look to discover an AERD-specific gene expression
      profile which may one-day aid in diagnosis and expand current knowledge of disease
      mechanisms. As an extension, the researchers will correlate gene expression changes,
      specifically any finding of down-regulated EGR genes, with methylation changes (i.e.
      epigenetic changes) and genetic mutations.

    <description>Researchers will obtain global gene expression of freshly brushed nasal airway epithelial cells of AERD patients, non-aspirin sensitive asthma patients, and healthy patients using nasal swab samples and running RNAseq on the collected cells. Researchers will contrast AERD gene profiles against non-aspirin sensitive asthma patients and healthy patients and determine whether down-regulation of EGR genes is found in AERD.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether whole genome methylation profiling is altered in association with down-regulated EGR genes. Researchers will obtain complementary whole-genome methylation profiles of the study participants and will evaluate whether down-regulated EGR genes in AERD patients are associated with methylation differences by a composite analysis integrating expression and epigenetic data. MethylMix R software program will be used to identify methylation changes associated with gene expression changes. MethylMix integrates DNA methylation from normal and disease samples with matched gene expression. In summary, MethylMix defines hyper and hypomethylated genes by comparing methylation values of disease tissue vs. normal.</description>

    <description>To determine whether genetic mutations associate with down-regulated EGR gene expression in AERD patients. We will obtain genotypes on these same study participants and evaluate whether down-regulated EGR genes are associated with mutations by a composite analysis integrating expression and genotypes. The Affymetrix genotyping workflow consists of 4 steps; first 3 steps use a set of stand-alone software packages, and the 4th step using R package SNPolisher. Sample QC will be evaluated by Dish-QC statistic, retaining samples with default Dish-QC &gt; 82%. Genotyped samples with a call rate lower than default value of 97% will be excluded. Platewise QC will be evaluated by manually calculating 'Plate Pass Rate' and 'Average Plate Call Rate' statistics, with default cutoff values of 95 and 99%. Genotyping step will be rerun for samples passing quality criteria. SNPolisher will evaluate quality of the signal and classify each SNP probe.</description>
