      Evaluation of a novel mobile application designed to estimate blood pressure
      (systolic-diastolic and mean arterial pressure) based on collected optical signals on
      patient's finger treated in pregnant woman and in surgical patients during the perioperative
      period

      The purpose of the study is to compare the blood pressure values measured by a novel mobile
      phone application ( camera of the smartphone will be obstructed by the patient's right index)
      and the values measured by reference method used (the oscillometric brachial cuff).

      All Woman patients admitted to the Delivery room department and all patients scheduled for
      noncardiac surgery (2 cohorts) at Erasme Hospital Brussels, Belgium will be recruited and
      their pressure will be measured with both mesurement methods. (novel smartphone application
      versus upper arm cuff oscillometry) at 5 time points.

      The OptiBP Application is a mobile application installed on a mobile phone which is a
      non-invasive data-logger intended to acquire physiological data from patients. By applying
      the patient's finger on a smartphone's camera, a movie is generated and transformed into
      values of diastolic, mean and systolic blood pressure.

      Three measures will be taken (spaced by one minute) with both methods after a period of 3
      minutes of rest at each time point.

      The patient's blood pressure will be measured in parallel with the mobile application and
      with the reference equipment (the oscillometric brachial cuff).

      Then, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the reliability of
      the data obtained with the novel mobile application.

      The goal is therefore to compare blood pressure values as obtained by the analysis of the
      data recorded by the OptiBP Mobile Application, against simultaneous measurements provided by
      the oscillometric brachial cuff
