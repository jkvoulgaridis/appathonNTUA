      To determine if a high-dose first-line regimen is non-inferior (non-inferiority margin 10%)
      in terms of safety to the same regimen at regular dosing, in previously treated patients with
      rifampicin-susceptible recurrent Tuberculosis (TB).

      This is a pragmatic open-label multi-stage randomized clinical trial. Potential participants
      will be screened and enrolled in Damien Foundation (DF) clinics participating in the trial.

      First we will perform a two-arm study with 6EHRZ as control arm and 6EH続R続Z as intervention
      arm. If at interim analysis the intervention arm is not considered to be non-inferior to the
      control arm, the intervention stops and enrolment will continue in a an adapted intervention
      arm and the control arm (6EHRZ). Otherwise, enrolment continues to 6EHRZ and 6EH続R続Z.

      As per routine practice, during treatment patients are in daily contact with the direct
      observed therapy (DOT) supervisor and minimally monthly clinic visits are scheduled for
      monitoring of safety and treatment response.

      Additionally, liver function tests will be performed at fixed intervals during treatment. Six
      month and one year after treatment completion or cure the patient will be checked for relapse
      with systematic sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-microscopy and TB culture.

    <time_frame>6 months, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with recurrence, the recurrent strain will be compared with the diagnostic strain to identify possible differences in the resistance pattern. If the strain is the same, and resistance is not present in the diagnostic sample but is identified in the recurrence sample, then this resistance is considered as acquired. Resistance is defined as a) on genotypic Drug susceptibility testing (DST) (Deeplex or other): presence of a mutation in the resistance determining region for the drug with exception of generally recognized polymorphisms and silent mutations not leading to an error in the gene product. Heteroresistance at the proportion detectable by these methods will be considered at par with full-blown resistance, or b) growth at the critical concentration for the drug tested in phenotypic DST.</description>

    <description>A triple dose is defined as the triple of the routine dose used for a specific WHO weight band. Hence, the mg/kg within a weigh-band varies, as is the case in routine practice.
Dosing takings into consideration the fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets (one tablet: 150 mg R + 75 mg H + 400 mg Z + 275mg E). Dosage relies on tables with dosage by weight-bands used by WHO for the Cat. 1 regimen. The dosage used for the intensive phase of the Cat. 1 regimen applies for the whole treatment duration. A double dose of H and R is added to the recommended normal dose for adults (WHO,2003)</description>
