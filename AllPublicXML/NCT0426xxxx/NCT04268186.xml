  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fundamental advancements in understanding successful aging are limited by the lack of causal,
      rather than just correlational methods to connect age-related changes in memory ability to
      changes in brain structure and function. In this study, non-invasive electric brain
      stimulation will be used as a tool to create causal links between successful memory function
      in aging and brain structures associated with motivation. Recently, it was shown that a group
      of elderly, dubbed &quot;superagers&quot;, are indistinguishable from young adults in memory
      performance and the structure of cortical limbic regions. A key superaging region is
      mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), a brain structure associated with motivation and tenacity. The
      MCC is a hub region that synchronizes information flow between three core brain networks. The
      goal of the research is to explore the contribution of motivation to memory performance by
      modulating MCC connectivity with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to provide
      the first causal evidence that experimentally induced motivation can improve memory
      performance. Since MCC has not been stimulated with tDCS before, we will test three different
      stimulation protocols and compare against a placebo. The stimulation protocols were
      computationally optimized for this project. The primary aim is to find the stimulation
      protocol most successful at improving memory performance. In order to elucidate the
      mechanisms behind these changes, effects of stimulation on motivation and network
      connectivity will be investigated. If indeed memory can be improved by increasing motivation
      and effort via stimulating MCC, this study will generate new insights into the motivational
      mechanisms of successful aging.
