  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms following a Spinal Cord
      Injury (SCI). Strength training is recommended as an effective means to increase muscular
      strength and improve function for individuals with long term SCI. In contrast, the strength
      training guidance for those with a recent (&lt;1 year) SCI is lacking. Therefore, this study
      aims to investigate the feasibility of a method of upper limb strengthening - Progressive
      Resistance Training (PRT) and its impact upon muscle strength and function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial and recruitment will be conducted at the Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries
      Unit (QENSIU), Glasgow. Individuals with tetraplegia and upper limb weakness will be randomly
      allocated to receive either a tailored progressive resistance training (PRT) programme
      alongside usual care or usual care alone.

      Up to 30 participants admitted to the QENSIU will be recruited to the study. They will be
      randomised to the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive 8 weeks
      of PRT. An upper limb functional goal will be identified through discussion with the
      researcher and the participant. PRT will be individually tailored to target two muscle groups
      which contribute to achieving this goal. For each muscle group 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions
      will be carried out, resistance will be applied using wrist weights, free weights or
      resistance bands as required. Measurements of muscle strength and function will be assessed
      prior to, and following the study. Outcome measures: Manual muscle testing, Handheld
      Dynamometry, The Spinal Cord Independence Measure, The Action Research Arm Test.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in muscular strength - handheld dynamometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular strength will be quantified using handheld dynamometry, the main upper limb muscle groups will be assessed, bilaterally. Shoulder flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, lateral rotators, and medial rotators, elbow flexors and extensors, forearm pronators and supinators, and wrist flexors and extensors will be assessed. The order of testing the muscle groups will be consistent.
Handheld dynamometry will be conducted implementing the 'make' test. The participant will exert a maximal force against the device whilst the assessor will maintain the position of the device. Three trials will be performed for each upper limb muscle group. Prevention of muscle fatigue will be achieved by a 30-second recovery after each trial and 2 minutes rest between muscle groups. One or 2 trials will be used to familiarise participants with the testing procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual muscle testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular strength will be quantified using manual muscle testing, the main upper limb muscle groups will be assessed, bilaterally. Shoulder flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, lateral rotators, and medial rotators, elbow flexors and extensors, forearm pronators and supinators, and wrist flexors and extensors will be assessed. The order of testing the muscle groups will be consistent. Manual muscle testing using the Medical Research Council ordinal scale will be conducted once using standardised positions. This scale ranges from 0 to 5, 0: no palpable or visible muscle contraction, up to 5: muscle can move against gravity and maximal resistance over full range of motion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III) is a measure of functional independence for individuals with SCI. It is composed of 19 items that assesses 3 domains: self-care, respiration and sphincter management and mobility. The total SCIM III scores range from 0 to 100. 0 represents total dependence, 100 represents complete independence. The blind assessor will score participants on the items for each subscale. The subscale 'self-care' exclusively relates to upper limb ability. SCIM III reflects important aspects of independence specific to the SCI population. Its use has been recommended for individuals with tetraplegia, changes within the self-care category relate to changes in upper limb function. Furthermore, it has been reported to be reliable and valid for patients with traumatic SCI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb function will be assessed using The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) following the standardised protocol outlined by Yozbatiran et al., (2008). The ARAT assesses participants ability to grasp, grip and pinch objects, and make gross motor movements. Standardised materials are required including a box with wooden blocks, alloy tubes, cups, marbles etc. Score for the ARAT ranges from 0-57 points, 57 points represents the best possible performance.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will receive 8 weeks of Progressive Resistance Training (PRT), twice a week, in addition to usual care. An upper limb functional goal will be identified through discussion with the researcher and the participant. PRT will be individually tailored to target two muscle groups and will be chosen in order to develop strength to progress towards the participants functional goal.
The chronic spinal cord injury exercise guideline parameters will be applied (3 sets of 8-10 repetitions, 1-2 mins rest between sets). Participants will be inducted to their PRT programme and will then independently complete the 8 week programme. During each of the following sessions, assistance for set up of equipment and/or limb position will be given by the researcher and/or the participants family, friend or carer, once they have been trained. PRT sessions will be recorded in a diary to monitor sets and repetitions completed, and intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS)).</description>

    <description>Participants will continue with their usual care, consistent with standard National Health Service (NHS) care in this population. Usual physiotherapy care is provided, up to 2 times per day, 4 to 5 days per week, each lasting up to 90 minutes. Physiotherapists provide a combination of group exercise and one to one function-orientated physiotherapy sessions to improve balance, general muscle strength, wheelchair and/or transfer skills.</description>
