    <textblock>
      A technic of tracheal, carinal or bronchial transplantation using a stented cryopreserved
      aortic has been implemented by Pr E. Martinod in his thoracic surgery dept. The purpose of
      this study is to analyze the records of all the patients who have benefited from this
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the context of end-stage tracheobronchial disease (in particular tracheal or carinal
      indication) this technic propose a therapeutic alternative, in the context of bronchial
      replacement it allows to avoid pneumonectomy.

      The advantages are to reduce mortality at 90 days, functional consequences and long-term
      complications.

      In this observationnel study, data were collected prospectively in the medical records of all
      patients who have undergone a trachea or artificial bronchus transplant.

    <intervention_name>Tracheal, carinal or bronchial transplantation using a stented cryopreserved aortic</intervention_name>
    <description>Radical resection of the lesions was performed using standard surgical techniques. After resection, airway reconstruction was performed using a human cryopreserved (−80°C) aortic allograft, which was not matched by the ABO and leukocyte antigen systems. To prevent airway collapse, a custom-made stent was inserted into the allograft. In patients with proximal lung tumors, the lung-sparing intervention of bronchial transplantation was used.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Eligible patients were treated by human cryopreserved (−80°C) aortic
        allograft after undergoing a standard preoperative evaluation and cardiopulmonary tests. A
        multidisciplinary team approve d the treatment based on the following criteria: Patients
        (1) had proximal lung tumors requiring a surgical resection (pneumonectomy, carinal
        resection, or sleeve lobectomy) that may or may not have been treated with neoadjuvant
        chemotherapy and had adequate or compromised preoperative lung function tests; or (2) had
        significant major malignant or benign lesions of the trachea and bronchi untreated with
        conventional therapeutic approaches, and (3) have signed an informed consent form for this
        specific surgical intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:Patients were not treated by human cryopreserved (−80°C) aortic
        allograft if they :

        (1) had a lung tumor requiring a standard lobectomy; (2) had nonresectable major locally
        invasive tumors; (3) had contralateral lymph node invasion; (4) had metastatic disease with
        the exception of a unique resectable brain metastasis; (5) had tracheal lesions requiring
        standard resection with direct anastomosis; (6) had an iodine allergy; or (7) received a
        preoperative evaluation indicating an inability to undergo a standard lobectomy.
