  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study designed is to evaluate the safety of Canady Helios™ Cold Plasma Scalpel (CHCPS) in
      patients with solid tumors with carcinomatosis scheduled to undergo surgical resection for
      cytoreduction. Patients with stage 4 resectable tumors as decided by a multidisciplinary
      disease management team may be included if the metastatic disease is non-synchronous (e.g.
      recurrent colorectal carcinoma with hepatic metastasis amenable for surgical resection)..
      Plasma is an ionized gas typically generated in high-temperature laboratory conditions.
      Plasma coagulators are currently used routinely as surgical tools with multiple applications
      that create temperatures between 37° C to 43°C and cause thermal injury. Earlier studies
      demonstrated the non-aggressive nature of cold plasma. As evidence accumulates, it is
      becoming clear that low-temperature cold plasma has an increasing role in biomedical
      applications.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  Solid tumors undergoing surgical treatment with carcinomatosis scheduled to undergo
             surgical resection for cytoreduction. Patients with stage 4 resectable tumors as
             decided by a multidisciplinary disease management team may be included if the
             metastatic disease is non-synchronous (e.g. recurrent colorectal carcinoma with
             hepatic metastasis amenable for surgical resection).

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent form

          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study and must be willing to return for follow-up

          -  18 years of age or older and capable of providing informed consent indicating
             awareness of the investigational nature of this trial, in keeping with GCP guidelines
             and institutional policy.

          -  Biopsy (histopathology or cytology) diagnosis of a solid tumor as defined by the World
             Health Organization (WHO) or by cross-sectional imaging reviewed by a board-certified
             radiologist.

          -  Good performance status (ECOG &lt; 2), Karnofsky &gt;60%,
