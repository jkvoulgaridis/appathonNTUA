      This study will enroll 9-13 year old children living with HIV from Lima, Peru and Rio de
      Janeiro, Brazil as well as HIV-uninfected children of the same age group from the same areas.
      Baseline data collection includes: age, sexual activity status, pregnancy status and HPV
      antibody serology for all children, as well as HIV viral load, % CD4 or CD4 counts for
      children living with HIV (CLWH). Eligible CLWH will be block randomized to three
      interventions arms and HIV uninfected children will be directly enrolled into a fourth
      control arm. HPV vaccination (Gardasil 9) will be administered as single doses at study
      visits as follows:

        -  Arm 1 (HIV+) receives 3 doses at 0, 2, 6 months

        -  Arm 2 (HIV+) receives 2 doses at 0 and 6 months

        -  Arm 3 (HIV+) receives 1 dose at 0 month

        -  Arm 4 (HIV -) receives 2 doses 0, 6 months All arms receive an anamnestic booster dose
           24 months after the last specific regimen vaccine dose to elicit B memory and antibody
           responses. Arm 3 receives one additional dose at month 30 to complete the 3-dose
           recommended schedule for CLWH.

    <textblock>
      A generation of children living with HIV (CLWH) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are
      approaching the age of sexual debut and are, therefore, at risk of infection by oncogenic
      human papilloma viruses (HPVs). Three virus-like-particle based vaccines are highly
      efficacious in preventing HPV infections and disease: Cervarix, including types 16 and 18
      (2vHPV), Gardasil containing types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (4vHPV), and Gardasil 9 containing types
      6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 (9vHPV). Best practice HPV vaccination schedules for
      HIV-infected children are not known, and alternative dosing schedules may improve
      immunogenicity and provide better long-term protection. Duration of vaccine response will
      correlate with elevated anamnestic response measured 24 months after last dose of a given
      regimen. Importantly, this vaccine trial will take place among CLWH in resource-poor
      settings, and may have global implications for vulnerable children, who may have low
      nutritional status, etc., who would most benefit from highly immunogenic and efficient
      vaccine schedules.

      In vaccinating CLWH one of the critical questions is whether the vaccine will provide long
      term protection from HPV infections. Our studies will focus on the generation of long-lived B
      cell memory immunity. The investigators will test responses to the following: the standard
      three-dose regimen recommended by the CDC for CLWH (arm 1: CLWH), the two-dose regimen
      recommended for immunocompetent adolescents by CDC, Peruvian and Brazilian guidelines (arm 2:
      CLWH and arm 4: HIV-uninfected youth), and a one-dose regimen (arm 3: CLWH). It is well known
      that both antibody titers and B cell memory (Bmem) responses peak around one month after the
      last dose of vaccine then gradually fall and reach a plateau by 18 months post vaccination.
      Therefore, Bmem responses will be studied at one month after the last vaccine dose and again
      during the plateau at 24 months past the last vaccine dose. In order to stimulate an
      anamnestic response a booster dose will be given 24 months after the last dose of each
      regimen in each arm. Characteristic of an anamnestic response is a very rapid rise in
      antibody titer accompanied by a burst of plasmablasts. To measure these responses, blood will
      be collected at 1 and 4 weeks after the booster dose. Comparison of responses in arms 1, 2,
      and 3 will explore the need for a 3-dose regimen in CLWH. An innovation of this trial is to
      test, for the first time, the immune response to a reduced number of doses of HPV vaccine in
      CLWH. The purpose of this study is to find the optimum number of doses of 9vHPV to elicit a
      robust B cell memory and antibody responses in CLWH. Responses in CLWH will be compared
      against HIV-uninfected youth who receive the standard 2-dose regimens per CDC Peruvian and
      Brazilian guidelines.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Arms 1 - 3: Children must be living with HIV. HIV infection must be confirmed by local
             algorithm (positive NAAT test before 18 months of age with positive serologic test
             thereafter). Arm 4: Children must be healthy (without autoimmune disease or cancer)
             and not living with HIV.

          -  Children in Arms 1 - 3 must be on a consistent, clinically appropriate combination ART
             regimen for &gt;6 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Children must be 9- 13 year old (at or after 9th birthday, prior to 14th birthday).
             This will allow us to vaccinate participants within the recommended age range for
             receipt of HPV vaccination in Peru and Brazil.

          -  Children in Arms 1, 2, &amp; 3 (CLWH) must have clinical laboratory values as follows
             within 6 months prior to study entry: CD4% &gt;15% or CD4 counts &gt;200 cells/ mm3 and VL
             (&lt;400 copies/mL).

          -  All female participants must not be pregnant (all females will receive pregnancy tests
             at all vaccine visits prior to receipt of study vaccine).The effects of Gardasil® 9 on
             the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. If
             pregnancy is confirmed during the screening process, enrollment will not occur. If
             pregnancy occurs after the first vaccine dose, additional vaccine doses will not be
             administered, but the child will continue in follow-up.

          -  The investigators anticipate that all children will enter the study prior to sexual
             debut, although this will not be investigated clinically. Potential participants who
             report sexual activity will not be enrolled.

          -  Children in all arms must have the ability to understand and the willingness to assent
             to the study. Parents or legal guardians must be able to understand and willing to
             sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who have a serious illness requiring treatment with systemic medications
             other than ART (excluding short course oral steroids or inhaled steroid treatment for
             asthma), are currently under immunomodulatory therapy, received immunosuppressive
             therapy (&gt;10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for &gt;1 week) in the 6 months prior to
             enrollment date.

          -  Children who received any vaccine within 3 weeks prior to enrollment date (these
             children will be encouraged to enroll after 3 weeks have passed.

          -  Children who received blood-derived products within 6 months prior to enrollment or
             planned use during the study period.

          -  Children who weigh less than 18 kilograms.

          -  Children with cancer being treated with chemotherapy or radiation.

          -  Children may not be receiving any other investigational agents during the course of
             the study.

          -  Children in all arms with contraindications for HPV vaccination, or reporting previous
             HPV immunization. Children with contraindications to vaccination (including pregnancy
             or breastfeeding) or previous allergic reaction to any vaccines or constituents of
             vaccines.

          -  Children with physical or psychiatric conditions/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could
             affect the assessment of study objectives or put volunteers at risk.

          -  Children who are enrolled and later found to be seropositive for HPV at study entry
             (by Luminex assay performed by the Central Laboratory Core in Seattle) will be
             discontinued from specimen collection.
