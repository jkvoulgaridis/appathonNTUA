  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of pevonedistat +
      venetoclax + azacitidine improves event-free survival (EFS) compared with venetoclax +
      azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are unfit for
      intensive chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to
      treat people who have AML. This study will compare the improvement in EFS in pevonedistat +
      venetoclax + azacitidine combination arm group when compared with venetoclax + azacitidine.

      The study will enroll approximately 150 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment cycles and which will remain disclosed to
      the patient and study doctor during the study:

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Venetoclax 400 mg + Azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

        -  Venetoclax 400 mg + Azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 4 years. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy
      if that occurs sooner. Participants who discontinue study treatment without evidence of
      progressive disease (PD) will enter EFS follow-up or response follow-up (study visits every 3
      months) or overall survival follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent
      therapies and survival status).

CR is defined as bone marrow blasts &lt;5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥1.0×10^9/L (1000/µL); platelet count≥100×10^9/L (100,000/µL).

If fail to achieve CR/CRi, date of treatment failure will be set on day of randomization.

    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale is used to assess HRQOL in cancer participants and contains 30 items which incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global quality of life (QOL)/health status scale. Most items have 4 response levels (1=not at all [best] to 4=very much [worst]), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale (1=very poor [worst] to 7=excellent [best]). Supplemental items on symptoms (7 items) and functional impacts (3 items) from the EORTC item are included. The supplemental 10 items have 4 response levels (1=not at all to 4=very much). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status scale, higher scores represent better HRQOL; whereas for the symptom scales lower scores represent better HRQOL.</description>

               -  Albumin &gt;2.7 g/dL.

          -  WBC count &lt;25 × 10^9/L. Participants who are cytoreduced with leukapheresis or with
             hydroxyurea may be enrolled if they meet the eligibility criteria before starting
             therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has history of MPN with BCR-ABL1 translocation or AML with BCR-ABL1 translocation.

          -  Has genetic diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

          -  Is eligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Has extramedullary AML without evidence of bone marrow involvement.

          -  Had prior treatment with hypomethylating agents for AML (hypomethylating agent
             treatment for prior MDS is not exclusionary).

          -  Has clinical evidence of or history of central nervous system involvement by AML.

          -  Had diagnosed or treated for another malignancy (except for adequately treated
             carcinoma in situ of any organ or nonmelanoma skin cancer) within 1 year before
             randomization or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of
             residual disease that may compromise the administration of pevonedistat, venetoclax or
             azacitidine. Prior MDS is also allowed, but the participant cannot have received
             treatment for MDS within 14 days before first dose of any study drug.

          -  Has a WBC count ≥25 × 10^9/L

          -  Has uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Note: Known HIV
             positive participants who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible:

               -  Cluster difference 4 (CD4) count &gt;350 cells/mm^3.

               -  Undetectable viral load.

               -  Maintained on modern therapeutic regimens utilizing non-cytochrome P
                  (CYP)-interactive agents.

               -  No history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
                  infections.

          -  Participant is known to be positive for hepatitis B or C infection, with the exception
             of those with an undetectable viral load within 3 months (hepatitis B or C testing is
             not required for eligibility assessment).

          -  Has hepatic cirrhosis.

          -  Has uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.

          -  Has high blood pressure which cannot be controlled by standard treatments.

          -  Has prolonged rate QTc interval ≥500 msec, calculated according to institutional
             guidelines.

          -  Has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40%.

          -  As infection is a common feature of AML, participants with active infection are
             permitted to enroll provided that the infection is under control and no signs of
             systemic inflammatory response beyond low grade fever that makes participant
             clinically unstable in the opinion of the investigator. Participants with uncontrolled
             infection shall not be enrolled until infection is treated and brought under control.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
