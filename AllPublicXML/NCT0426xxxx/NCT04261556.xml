  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: to test the efficacy of this innovative cognitive remediation protocol for
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, characterized by a non-conventional
      focal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to boost the effects of a computerised cognitive
      training (CCT) in improving frontal-executive abilities, in a randomized, double-blind,
      sham-controlled exploratory pilot study. Secondary objectives: assess protocol feasibility
      and safety; evaluate its medium/long-lasting effect; estimate the extent of changes in
      cognitive abilities; evaluate any neurophysiological changes; indagate any related changes in
      other clinic-behavioural measures.

      Materials: Forty-four RRMS patients with predominant deficits in information processing will
      be selected. They will be randomised and equally divided to: real HD-tDCS + CCT (experimental
      group) and sham HD-tDCS + CCT (control group).

      Methods: Study treatment will last 40 minutes/day, 5 day/week for 2 weeks. CCT will focus on
      improving fronto-executive skills. HD-tDCS will be administered on the left DLPFC with a 4x1
      ring electrode placement and at an intensity of 2mA (real stimulation) for the first 20
      minutes of the protocol. Pre- and post-treatment and at 3- and 6-months follow-ups,
      participants will undergo neuropsychological, neurological and neurophysiological
      measurements. To assess changes over time, a repeated-measures analysis of variance will be
      applied. Functional and effective cerebral network connectivity will be calculated using
      phase-based metrics and Granger causality analysis. The relationship between
      clinico-demographical measures and cognitive/behavioural/physiological measures will be
      assessed using the correlation coefficient. Descriptive analyses will be provided for
      feasibility (overall compliance) and for safety (any tDCS-related discomfort/side effect or
      adverse event).

      Expected results: an improvement in cognitive performance in both groups, boosted in the
      experimental arm and not confined to general frontal-cognitive abilities; potential changes
      would be reflected also by neurophysiological measures and in QoL.

      Discussion: Investigators hope to provide additional treatment tools for RRMS subjects, with
      a medium-long term efficacy and an extensive effect. This exploratory pilot study will help
      to set the rationale for future studies, providing preliminary data useful for selecting the
      best primary outcome and for calculating a better sample size.
