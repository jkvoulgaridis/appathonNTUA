  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operating room S. aureus exposure has been directly linked to postoperative infections and is
      therefore an important target for infection prevention. Visible light (non-ultraviolet
      spectrum) at 405nm has been shown to be germicidal. We hypothesize that use of this light in
      operating rooms will reduce S. aureus transmission occurring within and between patients and
      reduce surgical site infections (SSIs). Visible light is safe for routine, continual
      exposure, and is less harmful than sunlight. We plan to install ambient, germicidal lighting
      in 4 operating rooms. This ambient light is not directly applied to patients (does not
      involve the surgical procedure lights). Patients will undergo surgery according to usual
      practice. We will conduct a case-control study where operating rooms with surgeries with the
      lights are matched to operating rooms with surgeries without lights.

      In Aim 1, 4 OR-pairs will be observed each day over an anticipated 103 working days for the
      primary outcome of S. aureus transmission events over a total minimum study period of 5.2
      months (103 working days).
