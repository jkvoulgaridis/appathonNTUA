      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) treatment, leading to the role of nurses to become more
      and more important. An Education-Based Intervention Program(EBIP) consists of several steps
      that aim to achieve better health outcomes through guidingCOPD patients to reduce dyspnea
      symptoms and improve chronic self-care management skills. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the dyspnea and chronic self-care management outcomes of EBIP compared to routine
      care.

      Research Hypotheses:

      H0: EBIP has no effect on dyspnea or chronic self-care management in COPD patients.

      H1: EBIP effects dyspnea outcomes of COPD patients. H2: EBIP effects chronic self-care
      management outcomes of COPD patients.

      Abstract:

      Background:Non-pharmacological interventions are a valuable aspect of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease(COPD) treatment, leading to the role of nurses to become more and more
      important. An Education-Based Intervention Program(EBIP) consists of several steps that aim
      to achieve better health outcomes through guidingCOPD patients to reduce dyspnea symptoms and
      improve chronic self-care management skills. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dyspnea
      and chronic self-care management outcomes of EBIP compared to routine care.

      Method:A total of 61 Stage II COPD patients that were hospitalized and treated in the month
      of January 2019 in a university hospital were selected for the study, who had been discharged
      less than one month ago and resided downtown. 51 conforming patients were divided into
      experimental(EBIP intervention) and control groups for a single-blind randomized trial. Data
      were collected using an introductory information form, pulmonary function test(PFT), the
      Baseline Dyspnea Index(BDI), body mass index(BMI) and the Self Care Management Process in
      Chronic Illness(SCMP-G) scale. There were no addition interventions to the control group. The
      intervention group underwent a 3-month EBIP intervention that included education, house
      visits and follow-ups through phone calls. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0
      with descriptive statistics, x2,Mann Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. p&lt;0.05 was
      statistically significant.

    <masking_description>Double blinding is not considered possible for EBIP interventions, where participants and researcher can recognize group assignment. However, giving and scoring the assessments were masked wherever feasible. The assistant researcher who administered and scored the questionnaires and the nurse that carried out PFT measurement and assessments were blind to experimental groups. Coded answer sheets were analyzed only after the study's completion</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>pulmonary function test(PFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from PFT at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is the COPD diagnostic criterion that the ratio of these two values is below 70% by measuring the forced vital capacity (FVC) with PFT and the demanding expiration volume (FEV1) in the first second and the ratio of these two values is calculated by FEV1 / FVC (% FEV1 predicted). According to the GOLD 2019 classification; 1. Stage-mild (FEV1≥80% predicted), 2. Stage-moderate (50% ≤FEV1 &lt;80% predicted), 3. Stage-severe (30% ≤FEV1 &lt;50% predicted), 4. Stage-very severe ( FEV1 &lt;30% predicted). In our study, the changes in FVC, FEV1, FEV1 / FVC (% FEV1) values were measured by including 2nd stage COPD patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline Dyspnea Index(BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from BDI at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI score is based on ratings for three categories: functional impairment, size of task, and extent of effort. Dyspnea in each category is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (severe) to 4 (intact). The scores of each category are added to create a total dyspnea score (between 0 and 12). Higher scores indicate worse dyspnea.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Care Management Scale in Chronic Diseases(SCMP-G)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from SCMP-G at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scale with 35 questions; These two types of protection concepts, defined as self-protection (20 items) and social protection (15 items), constituted two sub-dimensions of the scale. Self-protection sub-dimension items 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23 and 25-34 and social-protection sub-dimension 1, 3-5, 7, 9, 10, 12-14, 16 Consists of 17, 21, 24 and 35 items. The assessment of the scale was developed from a 5-point Likert form as 5 (Strongly Agree) and 1 (Never Agree). Questions 3, 15, 19, and 28 on the SCMP-G scale are in the form of a negative question and the evaluation needs to be transformed. Self-care management increases as the score on the SCMP-G scale increases.The overall Cronbach alpha values of the scale are 0.75, 0.78 for the self-protection sub-dimension and 0.78 for the social-protection sub-dimension.</description>

    <measure>body mass index(BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from BMI at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>BMI was measured using weight and height data. Height was measured with a stadiometer (precision 1 cm) and weight was measured using a standard medical weighing scale (precision 1 kg). The interview was concluded for the control group at this point.</description>

    <description>For the experimental group, EBIP was implemented in three stages:(1) hospital training;(2) home visits + training, which includes motivational interventions that facilitate chronic disease self-care and symptom management with nurse-patient cooperation; and (3) telephone follow-ups and assistance. A handbook was developed in line with the relevant literature and input from two specialist physicians (1,17-20). The handbook consisted of 4 sections that concerned improving breathing exercises, drug compliance, nutrition and illness self-care behavior. The trainings sessions were conducted in a hospital seminar room using PowerPoint presentations. Afterward, patients were asked to demonstrate what they learned, and the parts that were not clear were explained again. The training was concluded after deciding for the first home visit appointment. For patients that could not effectively use the handbook, a close relative was included to all steps of the study.</description>
