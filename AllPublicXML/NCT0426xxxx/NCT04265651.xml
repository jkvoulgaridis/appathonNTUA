  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of infigratinib, a fibroblast growth factor
      receptor (FGFR) 1-3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in children 3 to 11 years of age
      with Achondroplasia (ACH) who previously participated in the PROPEL study (Protocol
      QBGJ398-001) for at least 6 months. The study includes dose escalation with extended
      treatment, and dose expansion.

Dose Expansion:
Upon identification of the recommended dose from all cohorts analyzed, an expansion cohort of 20 subjects may begin enrollment to further determine safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the selected dose.</description>

          4. Significant concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator
             and/or Sponsor, would confound assessment of efficacy or safety of infigratinib.
