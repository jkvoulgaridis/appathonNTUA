  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are difficult to treat. Some forms of treatment have already been found to
      be effective, nevertheless chronicity is a major problem. For example, both cognitive
      behavioral therapy and family therapy (FBT; family-based treatment) appear to be effective
      treatment methods, in which FBT distinguishes itself primarily in its long-term effect.
      However, eating disorders persist in 20 to 25 percent of cases, only 46 percent of patients
      with Anorexia Nervosa fully recover and one third only partially improve. Since the mortality
      rate of this mental disorder is particularly high, it is necessary to keep looking to improve
      treatment. Because emotion regulation problems play an important role in the cause and
      maintenance of an eating disorder, more emotion-focused therapies may improve treatment
      outcome. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is a treatment that has a strong focus on emotions
      regulation, but so far only limited evidence has been found for the effectiveness of this
      type of therapy in eating disorders. Some studies show that art therapy (AT; art therapy) can
      contribute to a more adaptive regulation of emotions. However, this type of therapy has not
      been studied in the context of eating disorders yet. AT is an experiential form of therapy in
      which art techniques and supplies (including drawing, painting, clay, etc.) are used
      methodically with a therapeutic purpose. The idea that creative expression can perpetuate or
      improve mental well-being has been accepted worldwide for many years. Despite the long
      history of practical applications, to date little evidence exist on the effectiveness of this
      form of treatment. There's growing worldwide interest in scientific research and the emphasis
      on evidence-based practice (EBP) for this form of treatment. In a recent study, Lock and
      colleagues compare AT with cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) and the added value of both in
      a sample of adolescents with anorexia nervosa combines with obsessive-compulsive problems.
      Both CRT and AT are offered in this study in combination with family based therapy (FBT). The
      group in which the combination of FBT and AT was offered yielded better results than those in
      which FBT is combined with CRT.

      Study hypothesis: the investigators expect that complementing treatment as usual (TAU) with
      art therapy (AT) will lead to a decrease in emotion regulation problems in patients with an
      eating disorder in comparison with TAU only, without AT.

    <intervention_model_description>The participants are consecutively assigned in two conditions: a within-subjects design. Those from the experimental group receive standard treatment (TAU) with AT as an extra variable. AT is an experiential form of therapy in which art techniques and supplies (including drawing, painting, clay, etc.) are used methodically with a therapeutic purpose. TAU means that individual verbal therapy takes place on a regular basis, whereby the frequency varies depending on the severity of the eating disorder and the patient's request for help. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is provided with elements of dialectical behavioral therapy, and there is also the possibility of family or couple counseling by a family-based therapist. The participants in the control group only receive this standard treatment (TAU), without AT. Waves will be used: a control group will also become an experimental group at a later stage.
In this way the investigators can investigate the additional added value of AT.</intervention_model_description>
