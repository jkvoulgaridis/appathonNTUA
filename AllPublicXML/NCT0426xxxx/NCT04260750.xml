  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a factorial randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a
      internet-administered psychological treatment based in cognitive behavioral therapy. The
      first factor thought to be of relevance for the efficacy is the whether the content is
      selected by the participants themselves or by a therapist. The second factor consists of two
      levels: regular, continuous weekly support from a therapist or guidance on demand by a health
      care team consisting of a physician, a nurse, a clinical psychologist, an IT-technician and
      the principal investigator of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Becks Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the intervention (after 11 weeks), 12 months after the end of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of depressive symptoms. Possible range for the total sum: 0 to 63 (created by summing up the score from each item). Clinical ranges for minimal, mild, moderate and severe major depressive disorder are considered to be 0-13, 13-19, 20-28, and 29-63 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, during week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the intervention, post-intervention (after 11 weeks), 12 months after the end of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of depressive symptoms. Possible range for the total sum: 0 to 27 (created by summing up the score from each item). Clinical cut-offs for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe major depressive disorder are considered to be 5, 10, 15, and 20 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the intervention (after 11 weeks), 12 months after the end of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Seven items, the score is interpreted by summing up the score from each individual item. Higher scores indicate more severe problems with worry and generalised anxiety. The total sum ranges from 0 to 21 with cut-offs of 5, 10, and 15 representing mild, moderate and severe generalised anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Brunnsviken Brief Quality of Life Scale (BBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the intervention (after 11 weeks), 12 months after the end of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of quality of life, total score ranging from 0 to 96 with a higher score indicating a higher quality of life. The scores of each of the six primary questions regarding perceived quality of life within an area of life are multiplied with the score of an item measuring the perceived importance of the area in question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the intervention (after 11 weeks), 12 months after the end of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of insomnia severity and symptoms of disordered sleep. The total score can range between 0 (no sleep problems) to 28 (severe sleep problems and insomnia). Norm score ranges include low likelihood of sleep problems (0 to 7 points), some sleep problems (8 to 14 points), moderate sleep problems (15 to 21 points), severe sleep problems (22 to 28 points).</description>
