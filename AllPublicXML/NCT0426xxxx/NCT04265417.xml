    <textblock>
      Robotic rectal cancer resection with natural orifice extraction is a recently developed
      minimally invasive surgery for patients with rectal cancer. However, it's safety and
      feasibility remain undiscussed and controversial. This study reported the clinical outcomes
      and prognostic factors of robotic assisted rectal cancer resection alone vs. robotic rectal
      cancer resection with natural orifice extraction to discuss aforementioned question.

      Robotic rectal cancer resection with natural orifice extraction is a recently developed
      minimally invasive surgery for patients with rectal cancer. However, it's safety and
      feasibility remain undiscussed and controversial. This study reported the clinical outcomes
      and prognostic factors of robotic assisted rectal cancer resection alone vs. robotic rectal
      cancer resection with natural orifice extraction to discuss aforementioned question. From
      January 2015 to November 2016, a consecutive wave of 49 patients underwent robotic rectal
      cancer resection with natural orifice extraction and 49 matched patients underwent
      conventional robotic assisted rectal cancer resection were systematically analyzed in this
      study.
