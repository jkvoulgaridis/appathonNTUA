  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daily sleep variability is prevalent in the young populations, yet its effects remain less
      clear. The experimental study aims to examine the impacts of intraindividual daily sleep
      variability on sleep characteristics, cardiometabolic regulations and daytime functioning in
      college students.
