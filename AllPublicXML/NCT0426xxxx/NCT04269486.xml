  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observations on safety of the herbal medicines regarding liver and kidney
      injuries at inpatient setting of four sites in South Korea which are located at each quadrant
      of the country. In a previous study (PMID 28634823), six women presented liver injuries by
      herbs and similar findings were also reported. That knowledge has been developed to design
      the observations of females (19-80 ages) at least 2 weeks' hospitalization with weekly
      routine lab tests to obtain the occurrence of liver or kidney injuries and the profiles on
      micro biomarkers throughout the hospitalization period, and then, the follow-up test will be
      conducted in outpatient setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 500 inpatients will be observed to assess safety of herbal medicines with the balance
      of 70 to 130 each site. After obtaining the informed consent from patient, blood draw and
      urine collection are conducted prior to intake of the herbal medicine, blood draw and urine
      collection are routinely done every week throughout the whole admission period. The primary
      outcomes are, 1) liver for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), RUCAM (in case of causality
      assessment when ALT≥3 upper normal limit) and new biomarker, mircoRNA-122 and 2) kidney for
      urine creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and new biomarker, Neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The secondary outcomes are, 1) liver for aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyltransferase (γ-GT), total
      bilirubin and new biomarker, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) and 2) kidney for serum
      creatinine and new biomarker, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). The follow-up will be done by
      the study doctors based on their decision on the inpatient after discharge.
