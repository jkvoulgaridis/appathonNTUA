  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether essential oil aromatherapy could improve or
      eliminate the smell of burnt flesh from electrocautery and subsequently mitigate patient
      anxiety and discomfort during dermatologic skin surgery.

      This is a randomized clinical trial. Approximately 210 electrocautery participants will be
      randomized to receive sham control/no aromatherapy or aromatherapy. Patients will be asked to
      complete a questionnaire after completion of the procedure to assess their experience. This
      study was a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of this procedure.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be invited and considered for enrollment.
