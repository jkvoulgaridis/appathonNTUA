  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic bilateral vestibular hypofunction may suffer from a visual instability
      during head movement called oscillopsia. Visual consequence of vestibular deficit can lead to
      a severe impairment of their quality of life. However, correcting saccades during rapid head
      movement, called covert-saccades, have been more recently identified. These saccades, which
      occur during the head movement in patients with vestibular hypofunction, present a very short
      latency. They could compensate for the lack of vestibular-ocular reflex and greatly decrease
      oscillopsia and visual impairment. The triggering of these covert-saccade is still not known.
      They could be of visual origin but the short latency is unusual. The objective of this study
      is to evaluate the potential role of visual trigger in 12 patients with chronic bilateral
      areflexia, using different visuo-vestibular conditions. The latency of simple visually guided
      saccades will also be tested in the group of patients and a group of 12 healthy controls.

    <description>During this intervention, patients will undergo head impulse testing while wearing virtual reality Headsets. During the head impulse tests the visual information will be modified in order to create a conflict between head rotation and rotation of the visual scene. Recording of head and eye movement will be done during these head impulses in order to verify if visual information modifies compensatory eye movements during head impulses.</description>
