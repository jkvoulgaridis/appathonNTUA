      Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose in Pediatric Patients
      with Iron Deficiency Anemia and an Unsatisfactory Response to Oral Iron under Study Protocol
      1VIT17044

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, multi-national, non-randomized study that
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one course treatment with FCM in participants who
      had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron in study 1VIT17044.

      Subjects will have an End of Study (EOS) Visit (Day 35) from the 1VIT17044 study to qualify
      for entry. Subjects will then be screened, meet all inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria
      and have a baseline evaluation. Based on the successful completion of the baseline
      evaluations, subjects will be enrolled and will receive the first dose of FCM (Day 0). The
      second FCM dose will occur 7 days from the first dose. Subjects will return to the clinic 14
      and 28 days post their first dose for laboratory and safety assessments, and at 35 days post
      the first dose, participants will return to the clinic for final safety and efficacy
      assessments. Once all assessments are complete the participant will exit the study.

      An unsatisfactory response to oral iron (i.e., an increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) of &lt;1 g/dL
      from baseline) will be defined as non-responders to oral iron treatment. Non-responders who
      continue to meet all inclusion criteria (including Hgb &lt;11 g/dL) and none of the exclusion
      criteria will receive 1 course of FCM.

    <description>The primary objective in this study is to allow participants who were randomized to receive oral iron in the 1VIT17044 trial and who had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron or those that required a concomitant intervention, (defined as, blood transfusion, use of IV or oral iron outside of protocol, increase in erythropoietin for any reason [Day 0 thru Day 35 of study protocol 1VIT17044], change in IBD treatment) to receive one course of FCM. This course of FCM will consist of two doses of FCM at 15 mg/kg (maximum single dose of 750 mg), separated by seven days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Unsatisfactory response to oral iron or those that required a concomitant
             intervention, (defined as, blood transfusion, use of IV or oral iron outside of
             protocol, increase in erythropoietin for any reason [Day 0 thru Day 35 of study
             protocol 1VIT17044], change in IBD treatment).

          2. Hgb &lt;11 g/dL

          3. Ferritin â‰¤300 ng/mL and TSAT &lt;30%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of hypersensitivity reaction to any component of FCM.

          2. History of acquired iron overload, hemochromatosis, or other iron accumulation
             disorders.

          3. History of significant diseases of the liver, hematopoietic system, cardiovascular
             system, psychiatric disorder, or other conditions which, in the opinion of the

          7. Anemia due to reasons other than iron deficiency (e.g., hemoglobinopathy and vitamin
             B12 or folic acid deficiency) that has not been corrected.

          8. Administration and / or use of an investigational product (drug or device) within 30
             days of screening.
