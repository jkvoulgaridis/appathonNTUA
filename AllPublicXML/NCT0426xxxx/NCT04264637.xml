      In this study researchers want to learn how quickly patients suffering from allergic rhinitis
      (also known as hay fever) can expect symptom relief after using Azelastine Hydrochloride
      0.15% Nasal Spray.

      This study plans to enrol about 80 male or female participants in the age of 18 to 65 years
      suffering from an allergic rhinitis to ragweed pollen for at least 2 years. In a first phase
      participants will be exposed to ragweed pollen in a special study room to ensure they will be
      adequately symptomatic when they progress into the treatment phase of the study. In a second
      phase study participants will be divided in 2 groups. After exposure to ragweed pollen one
      group will receive Azelastine Hydrochloride 0.15% Nasal Spray and the other group will
      receive placebo (a nasal spray which does not contain any active drug substance). In the
      third phase of study the treatment will be switched: participants who received in the
      previous study Azelastine Hydrochloride 0.15% Nasal Spray will receive the nasal spray
      without any active drug substance and the other group will receive Azelastine Hydrochloride
      0.15% Nasal Spray. During the second and third study phase the researchers will examine
      thoroughly over 4 hours the change of nasal symptoms such as runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing
      and nasal congestion after participants received the nasal spray.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, ambulatory, male or female volunteers 18 to 65 years of age with selfreported
             allergic rhinitis to ragweed pollen for at least 2 years prior.

          -  Documented positive skin prick test response to common ragweed (ambrosia
             artemisiifolia) pollen; prick with wheal ≥3 mm larger than the diluent response at
             screening or within the previous 12 months done at the research site.
