    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi‐reader, multi‐case (MRMC) reader study is to evaluate reader
      performance when SoftVue™ automated breast ultrasound and screening mammography are combined,
      compared to screening mammography alone, in women with dense breast parenchyma.

      This reader study will include up to 32 radiologist readers and a sample of 140 breast
      screening cases that were selected from the library of images collected under Delphinus
      Protocol #DMT‐2015.001 (NCT03257839) Arm 1 Phase B. The reader study image case set will be
      enriched with cancer cases.

        Readers will evaluate mammography and SoftVue images acquired at study entry from consented
        participants in protocol DMT-2015.001, and subsequently categorized into the following case
        types, in random order:

          -  Cancer cases, confirmed by breast biopsy with at least one lesion determined to be
             malignant during participation

          -  Non‐Cancer cases including, but not limited to benign cases, confirmed by breast
             biopsy with no lesions determined to be malignant, or normal/negative screening or
             diagnostic imaging during participation
