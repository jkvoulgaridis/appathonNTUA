    <description>Safety: Major Adverse Events (MAEs) Defined as: all-cause mortality (ACM), retrograde type A dissection (RTAD), aortic rupture, permanent paraplegia and paraparesis, stent induced new entry tear, conversion to open repair, disabling stroke, and non-preexisting renal failure.
Effectiveness: Technical success defined as ability to advance, deploy and position the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft at target site with successful coverage and sealing of the proximal entry tear and removal of the delivery system.
The primary endpoint is a dichotomous study outcome and a composite endpoint. A subject who has technical success and no MAE reported within 1-month will be considered a success.</description>
