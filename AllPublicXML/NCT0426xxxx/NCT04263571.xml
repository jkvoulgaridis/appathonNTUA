  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multidisciplinary study, which involves all kind of medical specialties.
      Patients, who are scheduled for elective surgery, will be seen at a multidisciplinary
      anaesthesia/Patient Blood Management (PBM) clinic and screened for anaemia prior to surgery.
      Anaemic patients will eventually be treated with 500mg of iron isomaltoside.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hgb levels, standard iron parameters and hepcidin will be assessed. Additional parameters
      that might influence Hgb or IVI levels will be documented.

      All main analyses will be pre-defined in detail in a statistical analysis plan. In order to
      analyse the responsiveness to IVI, the change in Hgb levels from PBM clinic to day 0 will be
      analysed using multivariable regression models. The association of change in Hgb and hepcidin
      will be analysed adjusting for potentially confounding factors as age, gender or number of
      days from PBM clinic to surgery. The correlation of hepcidin and standard iron parameters
      will be assessed. Based on the increase in Hgb levels, responders to IVI will be defined. The
      definition of good- bad responder in terms of delta Hgb levels depends on the time between
      IVI substitution and surgery. ROC analyses will be performed and potential predictors (e.g.
      hepcidin, ferritin) will be compared concerning the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
