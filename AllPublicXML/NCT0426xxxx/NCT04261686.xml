        Clinical Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject must voluntarily sign and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to
             collection of study data or performance of study procedures.

          2. Subject must be either a male or non-pregnant female ≥ 21 years of age with an
             expected lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.

          3. Subject must be willing to comply with the protocol requirements, including clinical
             and telephone follow-up.

          4. Subject must have an upper extremity AV fistula that has undergone at least one
             successful dialysis session with two-needle cannulation, prior to the index procedure.

          5. Subject must have angiographic evidence of a stenosis ≥ 50% (by visual estimation)
             located in the venous outflow of the AV access circuit and present with clinical or
             hemodynamic evidence of AV fistula dysfunction.

          6. The target lesion must be ≤ 9cm in length. Note: multiple stenoses may exist within
             the target lesion.

          7. The reference vessel diameter of the adjacent non-stenotic vein must be between 5.0
             and 9.0mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Clinical Exclusion Criteria

          1. The subject is dialyzing with an AV graft.

          2. The target lesion has had a corresponding thrombosis treated within 7 days prior to
             the index procedure.

          3. The hemodialysis access is located in the lower extremity.

          4. The subject has an infected AV fistula or uncontrolled systemic infection.

          5. The subject has a known uncontrolled blood coagulation/bleeding disorder.

          6. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast media which cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

          7. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to nickel-titanium (Nitinol) or tantalum.

          8. The subject has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.

          9. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device
             study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically interferes with
             the study endpoints. Note: Studies requiring extended follow-up visits for products
             that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not
             considered investigational studies.

         10. Additional stenotic lesions (≥ 50%) in the venous outflow that are &gt; 3cm from the edge
             of the target lesion and are not successfully treated (defined as ≤ 30% residual
             stenosis) prior to treating the target lesion.

         11. An aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is present within the target lesion.

         12. The location of the target lesion would require the COVERATM Vascular Covered Stent be
             deployed across the elbow joint.

         13. The target lesion is located within a stent.

         14. The location of the target lesion would require that the COVERATM Vascular Covered
             Stent be deployed at or across the segment of fistula utilized for dialysis needle
             puncture (i.e., &quot;cannulation zone&quot;).

         15. The location of the target lesion would require that the COVERATM Vascular Covered
             Stent be placed in the central veins (subclavian, brachiocephalic, Superior Vena Cava
             (SVC)) or under the clavicle at the thoracic outlet.

         16. There is incomplete expansion of an appropriately sized angioplasty balloon to its
             expected profile, in the operator's judgment, during primary angioplasty at the target
             lesion.
