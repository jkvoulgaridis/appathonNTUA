  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a serious health issue that should be managed in order to limit
      its adverse health consequences. SAS is known to induce cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and
      depression. The prevalence of SAS is still growing with social and economic repercussion.
      Today, polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard reference method for SAS diagnosis.
      However, it is a constraining and expensive technology. In order to improve patients' life
      quality, many new technologies have been developed for the SAS diagnosis.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the Sunrise®, a new medical integrated solution for SAS
      diagnosis, in comparison with PSG. This solution consists in a chin sensor recording
      mandibular movements and measuring the respiratory event index (ERI) through an artificial
      intelligence algorithm analysis.

      Sunrise® is a type IIa medical device with the CE label. It is a new home sleep technology,
      non-invasive, reliable and affordable by the patient.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the device in comparison with
      PSG for sleep apnea diagnosis.

      40 subjects, suspected to be apneic, will be equipped at home by the chin sensor, the
      Sunrise® device, recording their mandibular movements while sleeping. The Sunrise® solution
      will provide the respiratory event index (REI) as well as the respiratory micro-arousals.

      Inclusion visit will be executed at the University Hospital Grenoble Alpes. However, PSG and
      Sunrise® will be set at the patient's home by IC@dom. The first night, the patient will be
      equipped by both PSG and Sunrise® and only by the Sunrise® for the two following nights.
