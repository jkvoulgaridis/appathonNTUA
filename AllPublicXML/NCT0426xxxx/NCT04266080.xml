  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a game-based exercise plan can help increase the level of
      physical activity in childhood cancer survivors. The game-based exercise plan will involve
      participation by both a childhood cancer survivor and his/her parent or caregiver. This study
      will also look at whether the game-based exercise plan improves childhood cancer survivors'
      quality of life.

    <description>The study plans to recruit 30 childhood cancer survivors and a parent/legal guardian for each survivor. Participants will be provided with a Fitbit Inspire HR wearable device to record their step counts for two weeks pre-intervention, and over the six-month follow-up period (3-month intervention and 3month follow-up).</description>
