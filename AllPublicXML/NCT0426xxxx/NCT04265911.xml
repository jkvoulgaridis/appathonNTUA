  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 different dose
      levels of ASP3772 administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly to Japanese healthy adults
      20 to 49 years of age.

      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 different dose levels of
      ASP3772 administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, in comparison to the active
      comparator 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in Japanese elderly
      subjects 65 to 85 years of age.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAE is defined as an AE occurring after study immunization to the last visit (up to 30 days post-vaccination if the study is discontinued for an individual subject). An IP-related TEAE is defined as any TEAE with a causal relationship assessed as &quot;yes&quot; by the investigator or subinvestigator.</description>
