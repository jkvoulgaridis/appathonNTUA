      A Phase 1, open label clinical study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, tolerability and
      efficacy of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Protein 013 (FMP013) combined with (ALF with
      QS-21), saponin molecule derived from the bark of Quillaja species (ALFQ)) in healthy adult

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label immunization with Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) study.
      Healthy, malaria-naïve adults, aged 18-55 years old will be recruited into one of 5
      experimental cohorts in 2 parts.

      In Part A, 2 experimental cohorts of 5 subjects each will receive a series of 3 vaccinations
      at 0, 1, and 2 months at 2 doses (the &quot;low dose&quot; arm and the &quot;high dose&quot; arm).

      In Part B, 3 experimental cohorts of 10 subjects will receive a series of 3 vaccinations at
      0, 1, 6 months (called the &quot;delayed dose&quot; arm), the &quot;delayed fractional dose&quot; arm is
      vaccinated at 0, 1, and 6 months with the 6 month dose being 1/5 the other doses, and the
      &quot;standard&quot; arm&quot; at the 4th, 5th, and 6th month (after the first 2 vaccinations of the other 2
      arms in Part B).

               -  Negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody testing;
                  Note: As above, Grade 1 lab abnormalities detected on screening may be repeated
                  at PI discretion. Persistent Grade 1 abnormalities that are felt to represent the
                  non-pathologic baseline for the subject will be discussed with the research
                  monitor and documented before a subject is enrolled in the trial, and are
                  allowable per discretion and agreement of the PI and Research Monitor

          6. Birth control requirements:

             Female subjects must meet one of the following 2 criteria:

               -  No reproductive potential due to post-menopausal status (12 months of natural
                  [spontaneous] amenorrhea) or hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal
                  ligation;

               -  Women of childbearing potential should agree to practice highly effective
                  contraception at least 30 days before enrollment and through 3 months post-CHMI
                  or post-last vaccination (whichever is latest), using one of the following
                  methods: condoms (male or female) with spermicide; diaphragm, or cervical cap
                  with spermicide; intrauterine device; contraceptive pills, patch, injection,
                  intravaginal ring or other FDA-approved contraceptive method; male partner has
                  previously undergone a vasectomy; abstinence.

             Male subjects are encouraged but not required to practice highly effective
             contraception to avoid pregnancy in their partner from 30 days prior to enrollment
             through 60 days post-CHMI. This is due to the potential impact of malaria and
             antimalarial medications on spermatogenesis.

          7. For all female subjects except those with a history of hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy, a negative β-HCG pregnancy test (urine) on day of enrollment, each day
             of vaccination, and the day of CHMI (tubal ligations have a not insignificant failure
             rate, 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea does not completely preclude pregnancy and
             can be a result of polycystic ovarian syndrome);

          8. Reachable (24/7) by mobile phone or other method of communication (email, landline,
             etc) during the period between CHMI and 28 days post-CHMI, per volunteer report;

          9. No plans to travel outside the Washington DC metro area (DC, Maryland, and Virginia)
             between the day of challenge and 28 days post-challenge; For Travel outside the US
             occurring 28 days post-challenge to a malaria endemic area inclusion will be at the
             discretion of the PI.

         10. If a subject is active duty military, he or she must obtain approval from his or her
             supervisor per WRAIR Policy 11-45;

         11. Must have low (&lt; 10%) cardiac risk factors according to clinical Gaziano (NHANES I)
             criteria assessed at screening, and a normal or normal variant ECG;

         12. Completion of Study Comprehension Quiz (minimum passing score of 80% with 2 attempts
             permitted).

         13. Subject must be willing to take anti-malarial treatment after CHMI;

         14. Subject must provide 2 emergency contacts who will be made aware of the subject's
             participation in this trial and the vital importance of being reached during the
             challenge phase of the study. Both contacts must be verified by pone prior to subject
             enrollment.

        Verification will be define as either speaking to the emergency contact over the phone,
        hearing their name included in the voicemail response, or confirming the emergency contact
        uses the number if a third party answers the phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of malaria infection (any species) or residence in a malaria-endemic area for

             enrollment defined as first vaccination or day of challenge (for infectivity controls)
             or planned travel to malaria endemic regions during the vaccination, CHMI and 28-day
             CHMI follow-up period; For Travel outside the US occurring 28 days post-challenge to a
             malaria endemic area exclusion will be at the discretion of the PI.

          3. Any history of receiving a malaria vaccine.

          4. Received an investigational product in the 30 days before enrollment, or planned to
