  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of the patients with head and neck cancer are locally advanced patients.
      Radiotherapy is the primary treatment option for many patients with stage III and stage IV
      diagnosed with head and neck cancer. Radiation often causes tissue reactions by increasing
      local symptoms of the tumor and adding new symptoms to them. The acute effects of radiation
      are pain and burns associated with mucosal irritations and skin irritations, the root smell
      of the necrotic tumor and damaged normal tissues, dry skin, skin irritation, pain and dryness
      of mucosal membranes, decreased appetite, loss of chewing and swallowing skills, and
      hoarseness. The aim of this study is to make the validity, reliability and cultural
      adaptation of McMaster University Head and Neck Radiotherapy Inventory in Turkish.

      Although there are various surveys in the literature that evaluate the quality of life of
      head and neck cancer patients, apart from the &quot;McMaster University Head and Neck Radiotherapy
      Questionnaire&quot;, there is no other questionnaire designed specifically for local advanced
      stage III and stage IV head and neck cancer and treatment of specific morbidity at a certain
      time. Patients in these stages often have difficulties in oral communication, nutritional
      disorders and loss of chewing and swallowing skills leading to dehydration, bad mouth odors,
      appearance problems affecting social and family life, and often significant morbidity
      including severe pain symptoms.

    <measure>McMaster University Head and Neck Radiotherapy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>McMaster University Head and Neck Radiotherapy Questionnaire: This questionnaire includes 22 questions covering signs and symptoms related to 6 categories: oral cavity, throat, skin, digestive system, energy and psychosocial. n each category, there are at least 3 questions related to that category. There are 7 possible answer options in each question using Likert scale. High scores obtained according to the scoring system used indicate low toxicity. The final score of the survey is expressed as the average of the scores from 22 questions. In addition, the independent scores of each category are the average of the scores from the questions belonging to that category [1].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck Cancer Version 4</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 5 categories that evaluate physical (7 items), social (7 items), emotional (6 items), functional status (7 items) and a subscale consisting of 11 questions specifically developed for head and neck cancer. In this assessment consisting of 38 items in total, each field can be scored among themselves and a total score is also calculated. The increase in the total score shows that the quality of life is higher. Each item is scored by patients with a Likert type classification ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (too many).</description>
