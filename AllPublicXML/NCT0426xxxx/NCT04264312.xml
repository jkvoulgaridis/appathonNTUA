      Through two-stage stratified cluster sampling, investigators studied the antiviral treatment
      rate and the main factors affecting the antiviral treatment in community chronic HBV
      infection-related liver disease population.

      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. China has the
      world's largest burden of HBV infection and will be a major contributor towards the global
      elimination of hepatitis B disease by 2030. While, the antiviral treatment rate and the main
      factors affecting the antiviral treatment in community chronic HBV infections is still
      unknown. In response to the above situation, Sampling applied a two-stage stratified cluster
      sampling design in 16 Districts and 331 Townships. Investigators wanted to know the one who
      is eligible for treated criteria based on community in 25 and over years old in Beijing.
