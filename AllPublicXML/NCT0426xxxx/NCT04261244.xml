  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NEORAD trial tests whether preoperative radiotherapy results in an improved DFS and less
      radiation induced late effect compared to postoperative radiotherapy in higher risk breast
      cancer after NACT.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for high-risk breast cancer consists of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
      surgery followed by postoperative whole breast/chest wall irradiation+/- an additional boost
      (= irradiation restricted to the tumour bed in the case of breast-conserving therapy). In
      case of lymph node involvement in most patients require additional radiation of the regional
      lymph nodes. Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces ipsilateral breast cancer
      recurrences, breast cancer specific mortality, and overall mortality. The optimal time of
      radiotherapy in patients, who are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has never
      been addressed in a randomised controlled trial.

    <measure>Assesment of cosmetic results by the physicians and the patient using a 5 point Scoring System*</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>A grading scale is provided for cosmetic results (5 Point Scoring System):
E0 Excellent aesthetic result: At first sight no visible therapy sequellae. Both breasts have a similar appearance E1 Good: minimal changes in pigmentation, a visible scar, localized teleangieectasia.
E2 Moderate: marked sequellae with a clear deformation of the breast contour, nipple displacement, or marked skin changes, but yet &quot;acceptable&quot;.
E3 Bad: severe retraction or fibrosis, severe teleangiectasia. E4 Complications: skin necrosis</description>

    <measure>Assesment of cosmetic results by the physicians using breast retraction assessment-Score (BRA Score)*</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>*The BRA Score measures breast symmetry of the treated breast in comparison to the untreated breast. The average in the general population is 1.2 cm. A higher BRA score is worse. A BRA score of 0 cm is optimal.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of the quality of life (QOL): functional scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>QoL will be assessed by EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 questionnaires for overall QoL and EORTC QLQ-BR23 for breast-specific QoL. The QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions categorized in functional and symptom-specific scales and provides a global score through two general questions concerning health and quality of life. QLQ-BR23 is a standard instrument for measuring QoL in patients with breast cancer. The questionnaire has 23 items with four possible answers each (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much). Results are reported using functional scales (e.g. body image, sexual functioning) and symptom-related items (e.g. systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms). It is also common practice to classify the summary scores into four distinct categories with functional scales (0-25 bad; 26-50 moderate; 51-75 good; 76-100 excellent) and symptom-related scales.</description>
