  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify whether it is possible to safely discontinue treatment
      in relapsing-onset MS patients who have shown no evidence of active inflammation in the years
      prior to inclusion clinically and/or radiologically. The secondary objectives address the
      questions whether the discontinuation of first-line treatment has an effect on disability
      progression and whether the discontinuation of first-line treatment improves the quality of
      life for the patient. Furthermore, blood collections will be included to assess whether it is
      possible to retrospectively predict possible return of inflammatory activity with biomarkers
      such as neurofilament light (NFL) or patient characteristics such as disease activity prior
      to disease modifying therapy (DMT). In case of emerging disease activity after the cessation
      of therapy we will assess if reinitiation will lead to NEDA again, and if there are long-term
      consequences. If possible, post-hoc analysis are performed for the different types of
      treatment compounds.
