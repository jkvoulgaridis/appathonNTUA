  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary complications are the most common complication in thoracic surgery and the leading
      cause of mortality.Therefore, lung protection is utmost important, and protective ventilation
      is strongly recommended in thoracic surgery. Protective ventilation is a prevailing
      ventilatory strategy in these days and is comprised of small tidal volume, limited
      inspiratory pressure, and application of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, several
      retrospective studies recently suggested that tidal volume, inspiratory pressure, and
      positive end-expiratory pressure are not related to patient outcomes, or only related when
      they influenced the driving pressure. Recently, the investigators reported the first
      prospective study about the driving pressure-guided ventilation in thoracic surgery. PEEP was
      titrated to bring the lowest driving pressure in each patient and applied throughout the one
      lung ventilation. The application of individualized PEEP reduced the incidence of pulmonary
      complications.However, that study was small size single center study with 312 patients. Thus,
      investigators try to perform large scale multicenter study. Through this study investigators
      evaluate that driving pressure-guided ventilation can reduce the incidence of postoperative
      pulmonary complications compared with conventional protective ventilation in thoracic
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowdays, the usual setting of protective ventilation during one lung ventilation is tidal
      volume (VT) 5 ml/kg of predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm
      H2O and plateau pressure (Pplat) less than 25 cmH2O.

      However, a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is still being observed
      even with a protective ventilatory strategy.

      Driving pressure is [Pplat - PEEP] and is the pressure required for the alveolar opening.
      Static lung compliance (Cstat) is expressed as [VT / (Pplat - PEEP)]. Thus, driving pressure
      is also expressed as [VT / Cstat]. Driving pressure has an inverse relationship with Cstat
      and orthodromic relationship with VT according to this formula. High driving pressure
      indicates poor lung condition with decreased lung compliance.

      Thus, investigator try to prove that driving pressure limited ventilation is superior in
      preventing postoperative pulmonary complications to existing protective ventilation in large
      scale multicenter study.

      Recruit maneuver perform all group after intubation (stepwise increase of positive end
      expiratory pressure 5,10,15 cmH2O with tidal volume 5mL/kg).

      The control arm receives existing conventional protective ventilation with tidal volume of
      5mL/kg of ideal body weight and PEEP of 5cmH2O during one-lung ventilation.

      The driving pressure arm receives driving pressure limited ventilation with tidal volume of
      5mL/kg of ideal body weight and individualized PEEP. Individualized PEEP is adjusted to
      minimize driving pressure, it find through decremental PEEP titration from 10 to 2 cmH2O
      during one-lung ventilation.

Positive end expiratory pressure is adjusted to minimize driving pressure, plateau pressure minus end expiratory pressure from 10 to 2 cmH2O during one-lung ventilation.
1. Lung recruitment: stepwise increase of positive end expiratory pressure 5,10,15 cmH2O with tidal volume 5mL/kg, inspiratory:expiratory 1:1, respiratory rate 10. and driving pressure up to 20 cmH2O. Then decremental PEEP titration is performed using a volume-controlled ventilation until the lowest driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) is found.
