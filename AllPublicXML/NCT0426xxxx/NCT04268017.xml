  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate a smart insoles system in comparison to the
      gold-standard GaitRite in a healthy population. The device evaluate gait parameters in real
      time thanks to an embedded algorithm based on the processing of inertial measurement unit and
      19 sensors signals.

      At D0 and D7, the volunteer is evaluated by both the GaitRite® system and the FeetMe Monitor®
      system simultaneously. Healthy volunteers have two measurements 7 days apart. The volunteer
      repeats 5 trials at a comfortable speed on the GaitRite® mat while wearing the FeetMe®
      insoles. Each measurement is repeated by 4 different operators. A total of 20 trials are made
      by the volunteer.

    <description>For gait parameters' evaluation, the investigator asks the participant to move in a straight line over a 10-meter mat. The participant had to start the feet in line and then start walking at a comfortable speed. During this time, the investigator records the gait parameters from the FeetMe Monitor® and Gaitrite® system.
An operator asked the patient to repeat 3 trials. The same sequence was repeated by three other operators. The same measurement is done 7 days later.
A questionnaire is given to assess the ergonomics of the device</description>
