  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop and implement an evidence-based analgesia-sedation
      algorithm in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) using quality improvement and
      implementation science methodology. The analgesia-sedation protocol will be implemented for
      patients admitted to the pediatric ICU who require mechanical ventilation for greater than 24
      hours. Specifically, we will examine the impact of this implementation on total
      benzodiazepine usage, ICU length of stay, and ventilator free days, using a pre- and post-
      algorithm implementation comparative design.

      Study Design and exposures:

        1. Development of an evidence-based analgesia-sedation algorithm for mechanically
           ventilated children using an iterative, multidisciplinary collaborative effort.

        2. Exposure: Implementation of the analgesia-sedation algorithm using standard quality
           improvement (QI) methodology. This will include education, awareness, wash-in phases
           followed by actual implementation with support. We will use a before-after comparison
           design.

      Patients will be eligible if they are admitted to the medical and multidisciplinary
      (medical/surgical) ICUs at Boston Children's Hospital and require mechanical ventilatory
      support for greater than 24 hours.

      Study period: Eligible patients who are admitted to the ICUs between August 1st 2017 -
      February 28th 2018 (pre-implementation) and August 1st 2019 - February 28th 2020
      (post-implementation) will be enrolled.

      Data collection: Retrospective chart review, with manual data entry in REDCap.
      Pre-intervention data will be collected starting July 2019. After the intervention begins in
      July 2019, data collection will occur monthly with the intent of collecting compliance data
      through analyzing usage of a new electronic medical record order set designed specifically
      for this intervention and feeding that back to staff members via electronic communication and
      meeting presentations in order to assess barriers to implementation of the new algorithm.
      Prospective post-intervention data collection will begin in September 2019 and end in March
      2020.

    <description>The analgesia-sedation algorithm is a suggested protocol for approach to providing analgesia and sedation to patients admitted to the pediatric ICU who are newly intubated. The approach focuses on using dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative, non-opioids as the primary analgesia, then stepwise approach to adding in adjunctives (e.g. opioids, non-benzodiazepines) with the intention of minimizing benzodiazepine exposure and utilizing minimal-dose effective analgesia/sedative dosing.</description>
