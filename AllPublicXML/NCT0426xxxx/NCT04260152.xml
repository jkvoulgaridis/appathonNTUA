      This double blind, randomized, split mouth study evaluates the non-inferiority of Geistlich
      Fibro-Gide® in comparison to connective tissue graft for the treatment of Miller Class I or
      II recession defects at 6 months post treatment.

      A total sample size of 30 subjects (n=30) will be evaluated at 3 centers with 4
      investigators. Power analysis based on 80% power and past McGuire/ Scheyer matched-pair
      defect recession coverage studies, with one-sided confidence interval 0.025, indicates that
      in order to detect a 12% difference in root coverage with ± 15% standard deviation a patient
      sample of 25 should be used . Given the multi-center nature of this study and the intention
      to follow patients long-term, with normal attrition, 30 subjects will ensure adequate
      long-term follow-up and provide a &quot;power buffer&quot; for any outcome differences that might be
      seen between centers.

      30 Patients with Miller Class I or II recession defects on bilateral sites will be treated
      randomly with coronally advanced flap (CAF) in combination with either Geistlich Fibro-Gide
      (GFG =Test) on one side, and Connective Tissue Graft (CTG = Control) on the contralateral
      side of the mouth. Follow-up visits after visit 2 surgery will be conducted at week 1,2, 4,12
      and 24 and in the long term after 1,3 and 5 years.
