      Summary of Study Protocol. This project is designed to test neurobehavioral mechanisms
      underlying effects of the dual orexin-1/2 receptor antagonist suvorexant on sleep efficiency
      and opioid abstinence, and whether these outcomes are independent of one another. This will
      be the first study to investigate whether suvorexant improves outpatient opioid abstinence
      and sleep efficiency; and whether improving sleep mediates the improved opioid abstinence
      outcome. 180 participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) who have just completed
      detoxification will complete this intent-to-treat study.

      Study Design. Using a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial design,
      we will prospectively evaluate whether nightly treatment with the orexin-1/2 receptor
      antagonist suvorexant (10 or 20 mg/day PO), relative to placebo, can increase outpatient
      opioid abstinence and improve sleep efficiency (sleep time per time-in-bed) as a
      mediator/moderator among patients with OUD. We have included current major depression and
      current alcohol use disorder severity as stratification factors in the group allocation.
      Using power and sample size calculations, we estimate that 60 participants in each study arm
      will suffice to test our hypotheses. We anticipate enrolling 210 participants to obtain the
      180 completers (60 participants in each of the 3 treatment arms).

      The study aims to test three co-primary hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: Relative to placebo, at least one of the two suvorexant doses (10 or 20 mg/day)
      will significantly increase percentage opioid abstinence during outpatient weeks 1-13.

      Hypothesis 2: Relative to placebo (i.e. expected sleep loss related to opioid
      detoxification), at least one of the two suvorexant doses will improve sleep efficiency
      during the inpatient stay.

      Hypothesis 3: Higher inpatient sleep efficiency will be associated with increased outpatient
      opioid abstinence (independent of experimental group assignment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index &gt;38

          -  Acute/unstable illness: conditions making it unsafe for participation, conditions with
             potential to disturb sleep (i.e. acute pain, respiratory infection)

          -  Chronic illnesses; renal failure, liver disease, seizures, and dementing illnesses

          -  Current psychiatric disease: psychosis, bipolar disorder, PTSD

          -  Smoking during the night (11pm-7am). Nicotine replacement therapy is allowed

          -  Medications including anxiolytics, hypnotics (both prescription and OTC), sedating
             antidepressants, anticonvulsants, sedating H1 antihistamines (non-sedating second
             generation H4 antihistamines are allowed), systemic steroids, respiratory stimulants
             and decongestants, prescription and OTC stimulants, prescription and OTC diet aids,
             herbal preparations, and narcotic analgesics. All medications and doses will be
             documented

          -  Sleep-disordered breathing and periodic leg movements (PLMs) defined as ≥ 10
             apnea-hypopneas or PLM events related to EEG arousal per hour of sleep time, or any
             other primary sleep (e.g. narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome) or circadian disorder

          -  Although participants will be able to receive loperamide and non-opioids to alleviate
             withdrawal symptoms (documented, per above), any participant who requires or takes
             (via self-report or UDS) an opioid agonist treatment medication (buprenorphine,
             methadone) will be discontinued from the study, as this would complicate clinical care
             and threaten internal validity of the study

          -  Night-shift work, which would alter circadian rhythm and be a confound in this trial.
