  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare form of connective tissue disease characterized by
      vascular involvement and the intensity of fibrosis. The lack of available treatment is
      largely due to the very fragmented understanding of the pathophysiology of SSc. However, one
      of the keys to conducting quality research on this disease remains the development of
      well-documented patient cohorts with reliable biological samples. The main objective of this
      cohort is to study the natural progression of SSc in a cohort of patients followed over 5
      years.

    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare form of connective tissue disease characterized by
      vascular involvement and the intensity of fibrosis. Its prevalence and incidence are
      difficult to assess, however, in France, a population survey conducted in Seine-St-Denis
      calculated a prevalence of 161 cases per million inhabitants.

      The pathophysiology of SSc, the exact etiology of which remains unknown, involves an
      interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Its evolution can impact the
      aesthetic, functional and even vital prognosis of the affected patient.

      At present, no treatment to control this disease is available. The lack of available
      treatment is largely due to the very fragmented understanding of the pathophysiology of SSc.
      However, one of the keys to research remains the development of well-documented patient
      cohorts with quality biological samples. The investigators had the opportunity to start a
      major work on this plan with the VISS study (Vasculopathy and Inflammation in Systemic
      Scleroderma study) in 2012 as part of a project promoted by the University Hospital of
      Bordeaux (NCT02562079). This project has paved the way for many local, national and
      international collaborations. It has made it possible to structure and federate various
      partners of the Bordeaux University Hospital around translational research on SSc.

      The investigators wish to continue our research and collaborations by further strengthening
      our expertise in the collection of rare and valuable biological samples for this disease.
