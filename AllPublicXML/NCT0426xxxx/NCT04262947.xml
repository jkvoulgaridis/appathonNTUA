  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to define the effectiveness and therefore the role of NIR
      vein finders in adult patients with difficult peripheral venous access. The specific
      objective of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the clinical success rate of
      placing peripheral venous catheters in 'difficult' access patients using traditional
      peripheral venous catheter placement compared to two established methods utilizing NIR vein
      imaging. The investigators hypothesize that the capability to successfully place lasting
      peripheral venous catheters is increased with the adjunct of the imaging technology, reducing
      the number of failed needle sticks, reducing the number of peripheral venous catheters placed
      throughout a patient's hospital stay, and reducing the need for more invasive catheters such
      as PICC lines.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of NIR vein finders beyond the first line approach, particularly in patients
      that have failed conventional peripheral venous access methods or in patients that are
      expected to be a &quot;difficult stick&quot;, is not established. Conflicting results have been
      reported in the pediatric literature regarding the subjective benefit of NIR light devices in
      patients with perceived difficult peripheral intravenous access. In addition, knowledge about
      the efficacy of these devices in the adult inpatient setting is mostly unknown. The aim of
      the present study is to address these knowledge gaps.
