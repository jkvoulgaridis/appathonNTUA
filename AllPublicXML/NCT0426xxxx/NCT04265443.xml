  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary physiologic assessments by the pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) have
      become standard methods for identifying hemodynamic deprivation in coronary arterial stenosis
      for evidence-based percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Invasive physiologic
      indices-guidance enables on-site real time assessment for functional significance of
      epicardial coronary stenosis and the use of those indices has shown to be effective to guide
      treatment decision. Several studies further support the role of post-PCI FFR measurement as a
      functional marker of residual disease after PCI and prognostic indicator of patients.
      Although optimal cut-off values of post-PCI FFR varied across studies, an inverse
      relationship between post-PCI FFR and the risk of future clinical events have been reported
      consistently.

      Recently, non-hyperemic pressure ratios (NHPRs) have been introduced in clinical practice.
      Although there are several different NHPRs, previous studies consistently indicated that
      those NHPRs shares similar diagnostic performance and prognostic implications. Nevertheless,
      few reports were available for clinical relevance of NHPRs in evaluation of post-PCI status.

      In this context, we will evaluate the physiologic characteristics and prognostic implication
      of post-PCI NHPRs and compare with those of post-PCI FFR in patients who underwent
      angiographically successful PCI with 2nd generation drug-eluting stent implantation (DES).

      Patients who diagnosed significant coronary artery disease and treated by 2nd generation DES
      with post-PCI physiologic evaluation would be enrolled.

      Invasive physiologic assessment including recording of resting pressure trecing would be
      required at the baseline and at the end of index PCI procedure. PCI procedure would be
      performed upon local routine. Any available 2nd generation DES could be used. Web-based
      electronic-case record form (CRF) system will be used for collecting data. All data will be
      handled and analyzed by blind fashion at independent core lab. 2-year clinical outcome after
      index procedure will be analyzed.
