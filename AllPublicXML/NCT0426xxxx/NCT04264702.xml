    <textblock>
      The BESPOKE CRC study will prospectively enroll patients who have undergone surgery for stage
      II or III colorectal cancer (CRC) and who have residual formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
      (FFPE) tissue available will provide FFPE and whole blood samples. Patients will receive
      SIGNATERA™ test results and may be recommended for adjuvant chemotherapy or observation by
      their treating clinician. Patients will be followed for up to two years with periodic whole
      blood collection. The study also has a control arm that will consist of matched Stage II or
      Stage III CRC cases that have a minimum of least 2 years clinical follow-up data.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Examine the impact of SIGNATERA™ on adjuvant treatment decisions

        -  Determine the rate of recurrence of patients diagnosed with CRC while asymptomatic using
           SIGNATERA™

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Molecular residual disease clearance as assessed by SIGNATERA™

        -  Percent of patients undergoing surgery for oligometastatic recurrence

        -  Survival in patients treated with adjuvant versus no adjuvant chemotherapy in patients
           with SIGNATERA™ negative test results

        -  Overall survival

        -  Impact of SIGNATERA™ test results on patient quality of life

    <description>Determine if SIGNATERA™ results makes patients feel less worried or anxious about the possibility of cancer recurrence. Assess if SIGNATERA™ makes patients feel that they are receiving the right treatment and determine if patients would continue to use Signatera in the future to monitor their cancer recurrence. This will be measured by asking the patients three study specific questions on a 5-point scale (1=Not all, 5= All the time) with a lower score indicating a better outcome.</description>

The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The anxiety and depression subscales each range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety/depression complains. Patients were defined as having anxiety or depression or both if the score was 8 or more in the corresponding subscale.</description>

      There are two arms to this study: A prospective arm that will enroll 1000 patients, and a
      historical control (retrospective arm) that will enroll 300 patients.

      Each participant in the Prospective arm will have received the commercially available
      SIGNATERA™ test.

      Subjects prospectively enrolled and whom consent to &quot;Optional future Research&quot; may have
      bio-specimens stored for future research.The historical arm (retrospective cohort) will not
      have any bio-specimens collected or stored.
