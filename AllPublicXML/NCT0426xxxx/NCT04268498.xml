  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out whether carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
      (KRD) or KRD and Daratumumab (KRD+DARA) might be safer and more effective ways of controlling
      multiple myeloma than the stand or care treatment, which is lenalidomide, bortexomib, and
      dexamethasone (VRD).
