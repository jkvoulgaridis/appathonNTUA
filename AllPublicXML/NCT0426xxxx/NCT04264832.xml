    <textblock>
      To investigate the body fat distribution in chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS) and the association of those distribution with metabolic parameters, microeconomics,
      hormone profiles and psychological state.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic
      disorders in women of reproductive age. It is also one of the leading causes of anovulatory
      infertility and secondary amenorrhea, which represent major stress factors in the female
      life. In the previous studies, the investigators found that PCOS patients showed decreased
      quality-of-life and increased psychological disturbances compared with healthy controls. Body
      mass index (BMI) was associated with emotional disorders and physical aspects of
      quality-of-life and negative emotions were negatively correlated with BMI in PCOS
      patients.These results prompted that PCOS could be separated into at least two subtypes by
      the fat content. So the investigators expand the epidemiological investigation for comparing
      the body composition between the PCOS and the normal women, and finding specific biological
      indicators in different subtypes.

    <description>Basic characteristics: Participants were carefully characterized with regard to a general health history, a medical history, clinical, demographic and anthropomorphic measurements, skin problems (hirsutism is modified by Ferriman-Gallwey (mF-G) score , global acne score and premature alopecia).
A transvaginal ultrasound scan was performed on every participant during a clinical examination to determine the number of follicles and ovarian volume.
Metabolic and other assessments: General gynecological examination, prolactin, thyroid, androgen, LH, FSH, DA, 5-HT, metabonomics, glucose, insulin, triglyceride (TG), LDL and HDL were determined, OGTT was performed.
Questionnaires: The perceived stress scale(Chinese 14-item PSS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS）, self-rating depressive scale(SDS) were used to assess the participants' mental health status. The MOS item short from health survey (SF-36) was used to assess the quality of life .</description>
