  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost all gliomas relapse. After temozolomide rechallenge or combination with irinotecan,
      the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6%) of recurrent glioblastoma was about
      21%. After treatment with irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen, the PFS-6% of recurrent
      lower-grade gliomas was 40%. The optimal chemotherapeutics of recurrent gliomas has yet to be
      determined.

      Anti-angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A
      (VEGF) is the primary driver of angiogenesis in tumors. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal
      antibody directed against VEGF, is the prototypical anti-angiogenic drug and received
      accelerated approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Bevacizumab inproved the PFS-6% (36%), but had no effect
      on the overall survival (OS) (9.2 months). Moreover, the effects of bevacizumab are transient
      and most patients' tumors progress just after a median time of 3-5 months. Recombinant human
      endostatin (rh-ES) is an endogenous broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor that has been shown
      to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy when combining with conventional chemotherapy
      agents in non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma.

      In our previous study, we retrospectively analyzed the effect and toxicity of rh-ES when
      combined with temozolomide and irinotecan on adult recurrent disseminated glioblastoma. After
      combined treatment, PFS-6% was 23.3%; the median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 6.9 months,
      respectively, which were promising compared with that in other studies. Once patients get
      radiographic remission in a short time (4 months), they may get a long PFS.The combined
      regimen did not reduce the sensitivity of tumor to bevacizumab. After tumor progression from
      the combined chemotherapy, bevacizumab usage could help to prolong the survival time (5.1
      months versus 2.4 months). Moreover, the toxicities of the combination therapy in this study
      were manageable.

      On the basis of prior clinical experience, we carry out this prospective trial to confirm the
      efficacy and safety of the combination of rh-ES, temozolomide and irinotecan in patients with
      recurrent gliomas.

    <description>Temozolomide was given orally 200mg/m2 for 5 days in each cycle. Day 1 TMZ was administered 3-6 hours prior to irinotecan.
Irinotecan was administrated 125mg/m2 on day 1 and day 15. Recombinant human endostatin was administrated 15mg/d, daily for 14 days. One treatment cycle was defined as 28 days (4 weeks), even if treatment is held mid-cycle for toxicity.
Treatment was continued until disease progression, patient withdrawal, or unacceptable toxicity.
The maximum number of treatment cycles was 12. After 12 cycles of treatment, if the investigator judges that the subject may continue to benefit from the regimen, the duration of treatment may be extended with the subject's consent.</description>
