  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will provide data on evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of using a
      passive exoskeleton designed to reduce the negative impact of static and dynamic loads
      associated with body tilts, lifting and holding weights on the musculoskeletal system of
      workers. To evaluate a passive industrial exoskeleton for back support, a protocol was
      developed in which individual production operations will be modeled.

      This research will recruit 9 valunteers. During a 4-hour laboratory visit, each subject will
      perform three identical experimental tests: one test without an exoskeleton and two tests
      using two different modifications of the exoskeleton prototype. To avoid sequence bias, the
      test order will be randomized (balanced). Two types of labor operations will be simulated.
      One operation will consist in lifting the load, which is 20% of the volunteer's body weight,
      from a height of 14 cm to a surface with a height of 70 cm, the frequency of lifting is 1
      time in 30 seconds. The second operation is holding a cargo weighing 5 kg in a forced working
      position (tilt of the body more than 30 Â°) for 1 minute, after which rest will follow for 1
      minute, and then the work will be repeated. Both types of work will be performed for 105
      minutes, then a break of 15 minutes, then 105 minutes of work. Heart rate, blood pressure,
      ECG (Custo) will be monitored. An ergospirometric device (Metamax) will be used to collect
      muscle activity data (Trust-M, Myoton), inertial sensors (Trust-M) will be used to evaluate
      the biomechanics of movements. In addition, questionnaires will be filled out for a
      subjective assessment of the use of exoskeleton prototypes (local discomfort scale,
      exoskeleton properties assessment questionnaire).

    <description>Trust-M sensors with electrodes will be used to collect electromyographic data in accordance with the SENIAM recommendations. The muscles that will be monitored, the muscles of the arms, legs and back, which account for the maximum load. The locations of the sensors will be prepared by shaving, abrasion with sandpaper, and alcohol cleaning. The average amplitude of the EMG spectrum will be collected. The recording will be carried out at rest, standing before and after work, as well as outside work in the voltage position without exoskeleton and with it.</description>
