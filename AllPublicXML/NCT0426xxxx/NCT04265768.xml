      procedure concomitant to implant placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will characterize, for the first time, the healing pattern of soft tissues around
      dental implants in case of soft tissue augmentation and in comparison, to normal healing.

      An innovative and comprehensive geometric/thermal imaging analysis will be employed that is
      non-contact and non-invasive to patients and will allow to characterize the healing process
      in a 2D-3D dimensional and volumetric way.

      This approach, combined with LSCI and clinical and radiographic outcomes, will provide new
      data on the biology and critical phases of soft tissue healing around implants, as well as on
      the stability and aesthetics of the peri-implant tissues with different grafts.

      Patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) will also be used to assess the level of pain
      and discomfort associated with soft tissue augmentation procedures.

    <description>The OIPD is a well validated and frequently used PROMs in studies of oral health. It is a composite measure of the impacts of oral health on the quality of life of people. The OIDP focuses on the impact of oral health on the quality of life of people. The OIDP focuses on the impact that the conditions of the teeth and social wellbeing of the person. More specifically, it assesses the impact of oral conditions on basic daily life activities and behaviours (eating, speaking, cleaning teeth, going out, relaxing, smiling, major work or role, emotional stability, social contact). For each performance, both the frequency and severity of oral impacts are assessed. The overall OIDP score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

    <description>Global ratings on health and quality of life will be provided through two methods:
The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) included in the EQ5D questionnaire.
Through the following question: 'how would you rate the quality of your life'?
The response will be scored on a six-point scale as:
Excellent
Very good
Good
Fair
Poor
Very poor</description>

    <description>The extent of discomfort and/or pain experienced will be evaluated using a 100-mm horizontal visual analogue scale (VAS). The anchors for each end of the scales will be designated as none and extreme. Patients will be also instructed to quantify the analgesic medication taken. In addition, the extent of discomfort, root hypersensitivity, oedema, hematoma, high fever and interference in daily activities during the first post-therapy week will be evaluated in the same way.</description>

    <description>A series of subtracted images from the baseline will accurately identify the area and magnitude of the swelling, changes in facial shape, volume and temperature to monitor/quantify the healing. For every patient, a person specific template of postoperative facial swelling/oedema pattern will be created for sequential swelling/thermal changes or oedema volume measurements that will be applied on a unique alignment of the patient's specific consecutive imaging surfaces (self-defined positioning based on patients facial features).</description>

    <description>An epithelial-connective tissue graft of approximately 2-3 mm of thickness and adequate length will be taken from the palate or retromolar region of the patient and de-epithelialized with a scalpel (ideally a thickness of 1.5-2.0mm).
The connective tissue graft (CTG) obtained will then be positioned buccally to the dental implant and sutured to the internal side of the flap so to provide soft tissue bulk at the level of the neck of the implant and simulate a root prominence for the missing tooth.</description>

Fibro-Gide will be trimmed with a scalpel and adjusted in size and thickness to better adapt to the area buccal to the implant. In particular, the graft will be shaped in order to obtain a graft of approximately 2-3 mm of thickness and adequate length. Fibro-Gide will then be sutured to the inner side of the buccal flap, before repositioning the flap and suturing it in a tension-free way.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 20 and 80 years.

          -  Good medical and psychological health.

          -  Absence of untreated caries lesions and untreated/uncontrolled periodontal disease. If
             patients require periodontal treatment (non-surgical and/or surgical), this has to be
             arranged outside the study protocol and completed at least 30 days prior to the
             enrolment.

             region.

          -  Presence of adequate bone for implant placement without need for significant bone
             regeneration. In particular, the patients should have a bucco-palatal residual
             alveolar width of at least 6 mm at the central and crestal aspect of the single tooth
             gap to ensure complete embedding of an implant by bone (De Bruyckere et al., 2018).

          -  A residual alveolar height &gt;8 mm, enough inter-arch space for a crown and a minimum
             distance of 6 mm from the adjacent teeth.

          -  The width and height will be confirmed after x-ray examination in Visit 1 (or extra
             visit). Cases of small apical fenestration (≤ 25% of implant length) after implant
             placement will not be excluded, but will be treated according to the GBR principle
             (collagen membrane associated with a deproteinized bovine bone graft) to re-establish
             the bone contour and without over contouring.

          -  At least 8 weeks of post-extraction socket healing had occurred in the edentulous
             site.

          -  Willingness to sign the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Self-reported pregnancy and lactation.

          -  Any known systemic disease affecting bone metabolism (e.g. Cushing's syndrome, crohn's
             disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes type I and uncontrolled diabetes
             type II), systemic infections or recent surgical procedures within 30 days of study
             initiation.

          -  Chronic treatment (i.e., 2 weeks or more) with any medication known to affect oral
             status (e.g., phenytoin, dihydropyridine, calcium antagonists and cyclosporine) or
             bone metabolism (e.g. bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy,
             immunosuppressants) within 1 month before baseline visit.

          -  HIV or viral hepatitis.

          -  Physical handicaps that would interfere with the ability to perform adequate oral
             hygiene.

          -  Self-reported alcoholism or chronic drug abuse.

          -  Heavy smokers (&gt;10/cigarettes per day).

          -  Patients suffering from a known psychological disorder or with limited mental capacity
             or language skills such that study information could not be understood, informed
             consent could be obtained or simple instructions could be followed.

          -  Full-mouth bleeding (BOP) and plaque (PI) scores &gt;30% or sites with periodontal pocket
             depth &gt;5 mm at the completion of the pre-treatment phase.

          -  Very thin or very thick biotypes that according to the clinician's judgement would
             either risk to have complications or would not benefit from receiving a graft.

          -  &lt;2 mm KT buccally (from the mucogingival junction to the coronal aspect of the crestal
             soft tissue).
