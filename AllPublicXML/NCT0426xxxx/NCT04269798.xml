      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of FES on stimulation of the anterior
      tibial group by using the WalkAide foot drop stimulator on improving walking and balance
      abilities in children with hemiplegic CP.

      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of FES on improving walking and balance
      abilities in children with hemiplegic CP. Forty children with hemiplegic CP will be assigned
      randomly into two groups (A &amp; B). Control group (A) will receive conventional rehabilitation
      program for lower limb, balance and gait training. Study group (B) will receive conventional
      rehabilitation program as in group (A) in addition to FES by using the WalkAide foot drop
      stimulator. Patients' evaluation will be carried out before and after training to assess
      walking ability and balance performance.
