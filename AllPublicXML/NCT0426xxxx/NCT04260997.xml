  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17™ has shown promise in several pre‐clinical and randomized
      controlled clinical trials for weight management outcomes. The current randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial will further assess L. gasseri BNR17™ on
      body composition and weight management, and in a study population that is distinct to prior
      randomized controlled trials on the strain. The study will recruit 126 overweight adult
      participants who will be randomly assigned to consume L. gasseri BNR17™ or placebo once daily
      for 12 weeks.
