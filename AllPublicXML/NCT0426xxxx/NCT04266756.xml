  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) of selexipag and ACT-333679
      following single oral administration of the matrix tablet and the encapsulated pellets of
      selexipag, each with 3 different release profiles, as compared to selexipag immediate release
      (IR) tablets in healthy male participants.

    <measure>Area Under Analyte Concentration From Time Zero to the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC [0-last]) of Selexipag and ACT-333679</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose and 0 to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-last) defined as the area under the analyte concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last measurable (non-BQL) analyte concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma analyte concentration 24 hours (C24) Post Dose of Selexipag and ACT-333679</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose and 0 to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>C24 defined as plasma analyte concentration at 24 hours postdose.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Analyte Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose and 0 to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is defined the area under the analyte concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed measurable concentration, and lambda(z) is apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 50 Days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment and can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal
             reference ranges, the participants may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating they understand the purpose of,
             and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study

             than 50.0 kg at screening

          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 145
             millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg
             diastolic at screening. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated
             assessments within the screening period are permitted, last assessment being
             conclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis at

             investigator

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to selexipag or its excipients

          -  Any contraindication included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of
             selexipag

          -  History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or
             medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the study treatments (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed,
             cholecystectomy not allowed)

          -  Previous history of stroke, fainting, collapse, syncope, orthostatic hypotension,
             vasovagal reactions, head injury
