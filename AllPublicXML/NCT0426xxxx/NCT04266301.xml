      This is a Phase III multi-center, randomized, two-arm parallel-group, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of MBG453 or placebo added to azacitidine in adult subjects with
      intermediate, high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as per IPSS-R, or Chronic
      Myelomonocytic Leukemia-2 (CMML-2) who have an indication for treatment with azacitidine in
      first-line setting and are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) according to medical judgment by the investigator.
