      The aim of this study is to investigate if the systematic implementation of pre-emptive geno-
      and phenotyping, and therefore a dose reduction based on the French guidelines and the
      literature during the first month of treatment, reduces grade 3 or greater toxicity in
      patients treated with 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) or capecitabine.

      Therefore, a monocentric, partial prospective and partial retrospective trail was designed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      5-FU (5-fluorouracil) and its oral prodrug capecitabine are commonly used drugs in various
      chemotherapy regimens. According to the literature, approximately 30% of the patients
      experience at least a grade three toxicity during treatment, mainly characterized by
      diarrhea, mucositis, hematological toxicity or hand-foot syndrome. This toxicity can lead to
      discontinuation or interruption of the therapy, hospitalization and in 1% of the cases even
      to mortality. This leads to an increase in health care costs, mainly driven by the cost of
      hospitalization.

      The metabolism of 5-FU and its prodrug is primarily determined by the dehydropyrimidine
      dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme. The gene encoding for this enzyme, the DPYD, is known for his
      genetic polymorphism. Five percent of the population has a partial DPYD deficiency and 0.01
      to 0.1 percent has a full DPYP deficiency. Partial deficiency leads to a reduced activity of
      DPD and therefore to a reduced degradation of 5-FU or capecitabine to its inactive
      metabolites. This leads to an increased toxicity. The four DPYD variants considered most
      clinically relevant are DPYD * 2A, DPYD * 13, c.1236G&gt; A and c.2846A&gt; T. Patients with
      polymorphisms DPYD * 2A and DPYD * 13 have no residual enzyme activity, while in patients
      with polymorphisms 1236G&gt; A and c.2846A&gt; T, there is still partial enzyme activity present.
      In addition to genotyping, partial DPYD deficiency can also be detected by phenotyping. In
      the case of reduced enzyme activity of DPYD, the degradation of uracil is disturbed, causing
      an increase in uracil and a decrease in UH2 in plasma. There is a strong correlation between
      the UH2 / U ratio in plasma and the halflife, clearance and plasma levels of 5-FU.

      French guidelines, HAS (La Haute Autorité de santé), recommend to adjust the dose of these
      drugs at the start of treatment based on the results of both the genetic and phenotypic
      studies.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if the systematic implementation of pre-emptive geno-
      and phenotyping, and therefore a dose reduction based on the French guidelines and the
      literature during the first month of treatment, reduces grade 3 or greater toxicity in
      patients treated with 5-FU or capecitabine.

      Therefore, a monocentric, partial prospective and partial retrospective trail was designed.

In the group of patients with genotype &quot;wild type&quot; and phenotype &quot;intermediate metabolizer&quot;, a comparison will be made between group A with dosage according to French guidelines and group B with dosage according to literature. After obtaining written informed consent, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the frequency of severe (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 grade ≥3) ﬂuoropyrimidine-related toxicity across the entire treatment duration. Toxicity incidence between DPYD variant allele carriers and DPYD wild-type patients and poor or intermediate metabolizers and extensive metabolizers will be compared.</description>

    <description>The aim of this study is to investigate if the systematic implementation of pre-emptive geno- and phenotyping, and therefore a dose reduction based on the French guidelines and the literature during the first month of treatment, reduces grade 3 or greater toxicity in patients treated with 5-FU or capecitabine. Therefore a dosing table was obtained by combining the results of the study by Henricks et al., Launay et al. and Yang et al. and the recommendations from the French HAS guideline. The treatment schedule then will be discussed by the team of doctors and paramedics at the weekly MOC (multidisciplinary cancer consultation). Complementary, the pharmacist provides dose advice with regard to the start of 5-FU or capecitabine treatment.
In a subgroup, the group of patients with genotype &quot;wild type&quot; and phenotype &quot;intermediate metabolizer&quot;, a comparison will be made between group A with dosage according to French guidelines and group B with dosage according to literature.</description>
