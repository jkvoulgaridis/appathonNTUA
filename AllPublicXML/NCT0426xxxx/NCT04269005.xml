  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the impact of the &quot;stepped and collaborative care model&quot; (SCCM) on
      health-related quality of life in somatic hospital patients with psychosocial distress.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the burden of psychosocial distress, the public health relevance, and the current
      standard of health care, new approaches to a model of care for patients with mental-somatic
      multimorbidity are urgently needed. SomPsyNet is a comprehensive healthcare project for
      patients from somatic hospitals that promotes the prevention of psychosocial distress by
      establishing a stepped and collaborative care network in Basel-Stadt, Switzerland and may
      therefore help to counteract against the described lack of care.

      SomPsyNet is a &quot;stepped and collaborative care model&quot; (SCCM) including a
      Psychosomatic-psychiatric consultation and liaison Service (CL Service) and post hospital
      intervention supported by a collaborative network structure. It aims to identify patients
      with psychosocial distress at an early stage during their hospital stay in a standardized
      way.

      Implementation of the SCCM within this study using the stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial
      (SW-CRT) design will take place in phases:

        -  SomPsyNet phase 0: treatment as usual (TAU) in combination with the baseline and
           follow-up survey in a distressed focus sample.

        -  SomPsyNet phase 1: TAU in combination with the baseline survey, implementation of
           screening questions stage 1 ('baseline distress information from professionals', without
           consequence) in hospital routine and follow-up survey in a distressed focus sample.

        -  SomPsyNet phase 2 refers to the implementation of the SCCM: baseline survey, assessment
           of screening questions stage 1 (with consequence), screening questions stage 2 (with
           consequence) and if necessary psychosomatic-psychiatric consultation and liaison service
           including if applicable post hospital intervention and a follow-up survey in a
           distressed focus sample.

Trained staff will perform the follow-up assessment, and we intend to blind them regarding study phase allocation of the patients (if procedural aspects allow it).</masking_description>

phase 1: randomized and main control condition with TAU + collection of information on psychosocial distress in the baseline
Intervention effects will be estimated, using the distressed focus sample, contrasting Phase 2 vs. Phase 1.
We intend to conduct additional statistical analyses to compare data from phases 2 and 1 vs. phase 0 to estimate potential effects of introducing parts of the screening 1 without consequences.</description>

The intervention (SSCM) will be implemented step-wise in predefined sections at all three sites using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design. Clusters will be randomized to different sequences that dictate the timing at which each cluster will switch from the control to the intervention condition.</description>
