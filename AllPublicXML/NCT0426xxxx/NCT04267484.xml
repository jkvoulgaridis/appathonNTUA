  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most older people want to stay at home as long as possible. Effective self-management for
      people losing autonomy depends on reliable monitoring of their mobility, health and safety
      and active implication in decision-making. New technologies have the potential to provide
      information about changing patterns that reflect changing care needs. This information could
      help older adults, caregivers and health professionals to participate in decision-making
      about housing options when a change in living environment needs to be considered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-phase study to be conducted in 3 countries: Canada (Quebec and Alberta),
      Sweden and Netherlands. The primary objective is to provide e-decision support technology
      that will facilitate self-management in the context of aging in place and foster informed
      value congruent decisions about options to age safely at home.

      The aim of the project is to develop and validate a e-technology based on already existing
      components (e.g. GPS devices, diverse e-platforms and decision support interventions) to 1)
      help older adults with mild cognitive impairment/memory problems to stay safely at home as
      long as possible and 2) to provide older adults with decision support tools to help them make
      informed value congruent decisions (e.g. foster a shared decision-making process) regarding
      aging at home in a safe manner.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Assess autonomy and mobility of older adults with mild cognitive impairment/memory
           problems living at home.

        2. Inform shared decision-making processes about options to safely age in place for all
           those involved.

      The investigators will apply an integrated Knowledge Translation (iKT), comparative,
      mixed-methods approach to explore, older adults living at home with mild cognitive
      impairment/memory problems, their use of space in their homes and neighbourhoods.

      The project is divide into 4 work package (WP). In more details, during WP1, the
      investigators will collect spatial data (e.g. using GPS) and self-reported data (e.g. travel
      diaries, walking interviews, in-depth interviews, surveys). At WP2, the investigators will
      use iterative end-user feedback and end-user consultation discussion group to tailor a
      decision support technology to knowledge-users. At WP3, investigators will assess user
      opinion regarding factors that could influence their use of the newly adapted e-decision
      support technology. Finally, at WP4 the investigators will triangulate data and take into
      account differences between jurisdictions.

      This collaboration and our cross-country comparisons will contribute to scaling up e-decision
      support solutions in the future for the older adults with mild cognitive impairment/memory
      problems who want to age safely at home.

    <description>WP1, older adults with cognitive impairment will use a GPS tracker for 2 weeks, during which they are asked 1) to keep a daily diary about their activity (travel diary), 2) take the researcher on a walk that they often do (walking interview), and 3) participate in an in-depth interview after 2 weeks, in which their experience with the GPS ans the travel diary data are discussed.
WP2, older adults with mild cognitive impairment, caregivers, health professionals and technology developers will collaborate during group discussion meeting to co-design the e-decision support platform to be adapted.
WP3, older adults with mild cognitive impairment, caregivers and health professionals will then be asked to use the adapted e-decision support platform and fill a survey.</description>
