  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesh-type flexible tip (MFT) catheter is developed to generate bigger radiofrequency (RF)
      lesion, and contract force (CF) catheter improves the maintenance of catheter-tissue contact
      during atrial fibrillation catheter ablation (AFCA).

      The investigators compared clinical outcome of AFCA conducted by MFT catheter and CF catheter
      in prospective randomized manner.

      The investigators prospectively assigned 230 patients with AF in a 1:1 ratio to ablation by
      MFT catheter (FlexAbility™, Abbott Inc. USA) and CF catheter (TactiCath™, Abbott Inc. USA).
      The primary end point was AF recurrence after single procedure, and the secondary end point
      was response to antiarrhythmic drugs.

      A. Study design

        1. Prospective randomization (FlexAbility group vs. TactiCath group )

        2. Target number of subjects: 360 (180 per group)

        3. Rhythm follow-up : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 2
           month, and thereafter every 6 months; ECG if the patient has any symptom)

        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines

        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,
           cardioversion frequency, major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.

      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up

        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management

        2. Follow-up at 2 weeks, 2 months, and thereafter every 6-month.

        3. Rhythm control at 2 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter

        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.
