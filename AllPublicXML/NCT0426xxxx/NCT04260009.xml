  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase
      2 dose (RP2D) regimen and characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of brigatinib monotherapy
      (film-coated tablets and age-appropriate formulation [AAF]) administered orally once daily
      (QD) in pediatric and young adult participants in Phase 1 and to define the efficacy of
      brigatinib administered as monotherapy within the disease-specific expansion arms
      (unresectable/recurrent anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) inflammatory
      myofibroblastic tumor (IMT); relapsed/refractory ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
      in Phase 2.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Brigatinib. Brigatinib is being tested to treat
      people who have Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors or other
      solid tumours.

      The study will enroll approximately 61 patients. Participants will be assigned to the
      following arm group to receive brigatinib:

        -  Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Brigatinib Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2 (based on safety and
           tolerability)

        -  Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Unresectable/ Recurrent ALK+ IMT

        -  Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Relapsed/ Refractory ALK+ ALCL

      All participants will be administered brigatinib orally once daily in 28-day Cycles.
      Participants will receive fixed doses of brigatinib based on weight ranges. The starting
      doses in Phase 1 (Dose Level 1) are expected to provide systemic exposures of brigatinib in
      pediatric participants comparable to those achieved in adults receiving the recommended
      clinical dose of 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily. One additional
      dose level (Dose Level 2) is planned in Phase 1 if the initial dose level is tolerated. This
      subsequent dose level is expected to provide systemic exposures of brigatinib in pediatric
      participants comparable to those achieved in adults receiving 90 mg once daily for 7 days
      followed by 240 mg once daily (the highest acceptably tolerated dose in adults). In Phase 2,
      brigatinib will be administered at the RP2D determined during Phase 1.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and
      will be contacted by telephone OR a final visit after receiving their last dose of brigatinib
      for a follow-up assessment.

    <time_frame>Every 2 months until complete response is achieved (Up to 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. A SAE is any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
