    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to compare post-stroke upper extremity (UE) movement while
      wearing a brace called the MyoPro 2 Motion G versus UE movement while wearing a resting
      splint and no device in stroke survivors with moderate UE dysfunction. During the study,
      subjects will undergo general training in the operation of the EMG-controlled orthosis and
      the comparison orthosis, and then guided through a series of standard clinical outcome
      measures. These outcome measures will allow the researchers to directly compare the relative
      benefit of the MyoPro 2 Motion G with a resting hand splint and no device in reducing UE
      impairment and increasing UE dexterity and functional task performance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Measure of Arm Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered once/week for 3 weeks, prior to education on the device occurring. Then administered once, one week after device education concluded.</time_frame>
    <description>Impairment-based measure examining reflexes and active movement at each joint of the paretic UE. The assessor scores the movement at each affected joint from 0 to 2, with zero being no movement and 2 being normalized movement. The possible total score is 66 for this measure (the higher the better). Subjects' scores are averaged for each group and compared to see which intervention arm is the most effective. The test is organized in a proximal to distal fashion, with movements that would be more difficult for most patients presented later in the testing. For the test, subjects were seated in the same chair as the ARA. They were tested on each item by being given verbal instructions for each movement, immediately followed by performance with the unaffected extremity. Patients then performed the movement attempt with the affected extremity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Blocks Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered once/week for 3 weeks, prior to education on the device occurring. Then administered once, one week after device education concluded</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of the affected arm's gross dexterity. Subjects move blocks over a partition from one side of a box to another using the paretic UE. The number of boxes moved from one side of the box to the other within a specified, consistent timeframe is counted. Group time is averaged and compared to see what condition resulted in the largest number of blocks moved from one side of the partition to the other side. Thus the &quot;score&quot; for the B&amp;B is the number of blocks moved within 1 minute by each arm of each subject.</description>

    <description>Following screening, all subjects receive 2 education sessions, during which they are trained on the donning and use of the MyoPro 2 Motion-G, Comfy Splint orthosis, and no device, all on the affected UE. The presentation and training on these interventions is non-randomized and administered to all subjects. After these training sessions, all subjects complete a battery of three tests while wearing one of the two devices, or no device. The order in which the tests are administered is randomized.</description>
