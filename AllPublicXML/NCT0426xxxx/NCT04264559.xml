  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although some important progresses were made in the field of the meridian research, no
      breakthroughs have been achieved. Besides,there are some problems in meridian researches.
      Particularly, previous research of meridian phenomena involved lots of subjective elements
      and outcomes.Researches that use modern scientific techniques to investigate the biological
      characteristics of meridian phenomenon are urgently needed. Therefore, this study is designed
      to assess the heat transport characteristics of the Heart and Lung meridians by infrared
      thermal imaging (ITI). Thus, the biological characteristics of meridian phenomena could be
      presented objectively in a scientific methodology

      This study will include 40 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris (CSAP), and 80
      healthy adults. Infrared thermal imaging (ITI) examination will be adopted to assess the heat
      transport characteristics of the Heart and Lung meridians and investigate the specificity for
      the meridian-visceral correlation and site-to-site correlation between two specific
      meridians.

    <description>Two sessions of moxibustion intervention will be performed in the Heart meridian and Lung meridian successively. During moxibustion, the temperature change of relevant acupoints or sites in the Heart and Lung meridians will be measured by infrared thermal imaging.
Intervention in the Heart meridian: moxibustion will be performed in acupoint HT3 of the Heart meridian for 15 minutes.
Intervention in the Lung meridian: moxibustion will be performed in acupoint LU5 of the Lung meridian for 15 minutes.</description>
