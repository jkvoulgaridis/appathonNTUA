    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, longitudinal, controlled project will occur in two phases.
      Phase 1 is the pre-diagnosis data collection for treatment-naïve participants who are
      referred for a diagnostic endoscopy/colonoscopy due to suspicion of IBD. Phase 2 (RCT) is
      only for patients who are diagnosed with IBD. These patients will be randomized to receive
      biofeedback intervention daily for 8 weeks or no biofeedback intervention. All participants
      will receive physician directed standard of care treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC), affects 3 million Americans. In approximately 25-30% of patients, onset of
      these chronic diseases occurs prior to the age of 20. Despite medical advances in new
      therapies, the clinical remission rate on biologics is less than 50% and a significant number
      of patients will lose response to anti-TNF therapy over time. In addition, patients that
      require a change in therapy will have a lower response rate to a different biologic.
      Additional therapies and mechanisms that affect disease activity need to be investigated to
      identify complimentary treatments that can further impact remission rates without increasing
      side effects such as lymphoma.

      Environmental factors, such as stressor exposure, can exacerbate mucosal inflammation.
      Patients with IBD report a lower quality of life, as well as increased anxiety and
      depression. Psychological interventions may improve disease activity. This study will test,
      using a randomized clinical trial (RCT) design, whether biofeedback intervention will
      attenuate disease activity. If efficacious, this study will provide a rationale for
      establishing biofeedback as a complimentary therapy to standard of care to ameliorate
      stress-induced increases in chronic inflammation.

    <description>Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index total score. A standard measure of disease severity that is comprised of information obtained from patient recall (pain severity, stool frequency, limitation of activities), examination (weight, height, abdominal tenderness, perirectal disease, extra- intestinal manifestations), and laboratory data. The Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index total score will be used from pre-diagnosis, post-intervention, 4 months post-intervention, and 12 month follow up. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

    <description>They will also be taught how to use the biofeedback app and Inner Balance device. Additionally, they will also be educated on the principles of biofeedback and its benefits and taught how to maximize HRV by using self-regulation breathing techniques, guided imagery, and/ or self-talk.They will be given an Inner Balance device, which is an ear sensor that connects to an apple device that measures heart rate variability (HRV) and gives them access to an app that is designed to help them improve their HRV. They will be asked to use this device daily for 10 mins for the duration of the 8-week intervention. Patients and the research coordinator will have access to all of their sessions and results. The research coordinator will monitor compliance via the Heartcloud associated with their device and encourage adherence throughout the 8-week biofeedback intervention.</description>
