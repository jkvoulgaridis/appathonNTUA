    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open-label, randomized, phase Ib study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of HQP1351 and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HQP1351 in subjects with
      CML CP and AP, who have experienced resistance or intolerance to at least two tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib or ponatinib.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, phase Ib study to evaluate the PK of HQP1351
      and to determine the RP2D of HQP1351 in subjects with CML CP and AP, who have experienced
      resistance or intolerance to at least two TKIs. The preliminary efficacy and safety of
      HQP1351 in these patients will be evaluated as well.

      A total of 30 patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 ratio into one of the three dose cohorts:

      30 mg every other day (QOD), 40 mg QOD and 50 mg QOD, with 10 patients per dose cohort. The
      first cycle of 28 days is considered as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period.
      If the incidence of DLTs exceeds 20% (2 patients) in 50 mg dose cohort during the first cycle
      of therapy, this dose cohort will be stopped. The randomization will be stratified to 3
      groups: T315I mutated CML-CP and CML-AP, T315I un-mutated CML-CP, and T315I unmutated CML-AP
      to ensure that the subgroups are represented across all dose cohorts. Blood samples will be
      collected from each subject at specified time points to evaluate the PK of HQP1351. RP2D of
      HQP1351 will be determined based on the comprehensive analyses of the PK, safety and efficacy
      data of the US patients treated with HQP1351, when compared with that in the Chinese
      patients.

      Eligible patients will have disease resistance to or intolerance to at least two kinds of
      TKIs.

      Patients will be administered HQP1351 orally every other day (QOD) during a period of 28 days
      (1 cycle).

                       loss of CCyR, new mutations, confirmed loss of MMR (In 2 consecutive tests,
                       of which one with a BCR-ABL1 transcripts level≥1%), clonal chromosome
                       abnormalities in Ph+ cells (CCA/Ph+)

                    2. For CML AP patients: the patients must meet at least one criterion as
                       follows i.) Three months after the initiation of therapy: failure to achieve
                       a major hematologic response (MaHR) ii.) At any time after the initiation of
