  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to optimise the hand dexterity exercising program in virtual reality
      (VR) for patients with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Little research has been
      published on this topic, but the preliminary results are promising. Different levels of
      difficulty of a VR game will be tested. The patients will be assessed using
      neuropsychological tests of executive functions, visuospatial abilities, mental speed,
      flexibility and motor speed. Functional ability, coordination and cognitive abilities will
      also be assessed.

      Each patient meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised to one of the four groups
      (i.e., 10cubes game difficulty level). The patients will perform five exergaming sessions,
      each session lasting for 1 hour, on five consecutive working days within the period of two
      weeks. The 10cubes task requires that all 10 cubes are moved within 2 minutes. Each patient
      will perform the task 5 times in succession with 1-2 minute breaks. The patients will be
      assessed using the Box &amp; Blocks Test, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Delis-Kaplan
      Executive Function System (D-KEFS) and Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) before the first
      session and after the last session. In addition, the patients will fill in the Intrinsic
      Motivation Inventory (IMI) after each session. Based on statistical sample size calculations,
      the study plan is to include 80 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with
      multiple sclerosis randomising them separately, so that the groups will be balanced in terms
      of size and diagnosis.

    <description>The 10Cubes game (by I. Cikajlo) will be used. In the game, the motion of the hand, wrist and fingers is tracked by an infra-red camera (by LeapMotion, Inc.) and hand motion is reflected in the virtual environment. The software will run on a powerful computer with a 19&quot; display. Each group will have the game set to a different level of difficulty.</description>
