  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The malignant tumor at the thoracic entrance is difficult to be surgically removed, and
      radiotherapy or radiotherapy based comprehensive treatment is often chosen at the initial
      diagnosis. However, for patients with recurrence after radiotherapy, there is basically no
      ideal local treatment.The Radioactive i-125 Seed Implantation (RISI) therapy is characterized
      by high dose within the tumor target area and low dose to surrounding normal tissues, and its
      radiation dose rate is low, which theoretically benefits the protection of normal tissues and
      is more suitable for the salvage treatment of recurrent lesions after radiotherapy.3 d
      printing template technology is through the advance of the preoperative plan design and
      optimization, to achieve better avoid endanger organs, template of individualized and human
      body surface after laminating, registration accuracy, its guide pillar to precise control the
      direction of the needle, the present data show that in the template with CT guided by solid
      tumors as well had significantly higher accuracy, as the actual target dose of basic
      postoperative can reach the design request of the preoperative planning, so the application
      of 3 d printing template helps to further improve the operation efficiency and safety, also
      has potential promotion effect to curative effect.

      The purpose of this study is: (1) Observe the efficacy, toxicity and side effects of
      3d-printed template assisted ct-guided RISI in the treatment of recurrent metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of thoracic inlet lymph node after radiotherapy, and evaluate its safety and
      effectiveness; (2) to explore the relationship between the efficacy, toxicity and side
      effects of relapsed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of thoracic inlet lymph node after
      radiotherapy with different RISI doses;(3)the related influencing factors affecting the
      effect/toxicity of RISI in the treatment of relapsed lymph node metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma at the thoracic inlet after radiotherapy were analyzed.

      This is a non-randomized, prospective, single-arm, cohort study.Patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria were enrolled successively in the order of admission and treatment.In this
      study, the dose interval was set as 110-130gy, and a total of 30 patients were expected to be
      enrolled. The prescription dose was planned to be grouped into 15 patients of 110-120gy and
      120-130gy respectively. The specific situation was subject to the actual postoperative
      verification dose.
