  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of kidney impairment on the blood
      concentrations of PF-06700841 and its major metabolite. Findings from this study will be used
      to develop dosing recommendations so that the dose and/or dosing interval may be adjusted
      appropriately in the presence of kidney disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non-randomized, open-label, parallel cohort, multi-site study to
      investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability
      of PF-06700841 after a single oral dose of 30 mg. Subjects will be selected and categorized
      into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their estimated glomerular
      filtration rate. Part 1: A total of approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled; approximately
      8 subjects with severe renal impairment and approximately 8 with normal renal function. After
      statistical evaluation of results from Part 1, Part 2 may be conducted with approximately 8
      subjects each with moderate and mild renal impairment. The total duration of participation
      from Screening visit to Day 4 will be a maximum of 32 days and from Screening visit to
      Follow-up/Contact Visit will a maximum of 67 days.
