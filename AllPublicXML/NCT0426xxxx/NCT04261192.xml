  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of tumor organoid cultures in recent years has made it possible to widen the
      repertoire of available preclinical tumor models and to bridge the gap between cell lines and
      tumors of xenografted patients in mice (PDXs).These organoids have the advantages of being
      able to be amplified fairly quickly after resection of the tumor, of having unlimited
      proliferation potential, a high rate of establishment success, and the possibility of being
      transfected and cryopreserved. These characteristics therefore allow them to summarize the
      clinical spectra of cancers, but also to be models for studying tumor progression as has been
      done with organoids for colorectal cancer. They are also very close morphologically and
      genetically to the tumor from which they derive.Finally, clinical trials are underway to
      determine whether the organoids of mammary, pulmonary and colorectal cancers can predict the
      response to patients' treatments and guide the therapeutic decision.It would therefore be
      possible to test multiple treatments on different samples. This would allow screening of a
      panel of treatments on a given tumor type but also to test a treatment ex vivo before
      administering it to the patient in vivo. This prospect is very interesting in particular in
      the tumors of the VADS where more than two thirds of the operated patients will benefit from
      a complementary treatment by radiotherapy and / or chemotherapy whose consequences can be
      important. Despite this adjuvant management, up to 30% of patients will relapse, highlighting
      a variable tumor chemosensitivity. This screening could make it possible to refine the choice
      of treatments adapted to each patient and thus limit the undesirable effects.The feasibility
      of establishing head and neck squamous cell organoid lines seems encouraging, with organoids
      derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx having been recently
      established.
