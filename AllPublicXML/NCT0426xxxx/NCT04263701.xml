    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of dual task training on gait and balance
      parameters, gross motor function skills, functional mobility skills, functional independence
      levels and health-related quality of life o in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.
      The clinical study's hypothesis is the dual task training programs are superior to
      conventional physiotherapy programs to improve the parameters in spastic diplegic cerebral
      palsy.

    <textblock>
      In this self-controlled study, children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, aged 7-16, who
      were at level 1 or 2 according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System, scored 27
      and above from the Modified Mini Mental Test were included.

      Children are recruited to the routine physiotherapy program 45 minutes 2 days a week for 8
      weeks, and in addition to the routine physiotherapy program dual task training program 45
      minutes 2 days a week for the next 8 weeks. The children will evaluate at baseline, after the
      routine physiotherapy program and after the dual task training program. Children will be
      evaluate with Gross Motor Function Measurement-88,Modified Ashworth Scale , gait platform,
      Edinburgh Visual Gait Score, Pediatric Berg Balance Scale,1 Minute Walk Test, Functional
      Independence Measure, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory TM-Cerebral Palsy Module.
