  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of MR imaged administration of holmium microspheres</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is defined as successful treatment under MRI in at least 4 of 6 patients. Unsuccessful treatment is defined as having to abort the procedure for safety reasons, judged by the interventional radiologist, and having to complete the administration of microspheres under X-ray guidance as in normal practice. Possible reasons for this are uncertainty about the location of the catheter, or luxation of the catheter as a result of transport to the MRI scanner.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are followed up to 3 months after treatment, during which all adverse events are recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor/non-tumor ratio on MR based dosimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>MR based dosimetry is performed immediately after treatment, resulting in dose maps. The dose that the tumor received is divided over the dose that the rest of the liver received.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of dosimetry in Gray between MR based and SPECT based dose maps</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Voxel-based dosimetry will be performed, leading to dose-volume histograms with a dose value per voxel in Gray. Statistical testing will be done for differences between these data sets, i.e. the two different imaging modalities (MR based and SPECT based). It is expected that dose-volume histograms will be similar between the two modalities.</description>

             liver-dominant disease) defined as the sum of the diameters of all metastases in the
             liver be more than 200% of the sum of the diameters of all soft tissue lesions outside
             the liver.

          4. Patient is not amenable for standard therapies (other than radioembolisation) or
             patient refuses standard therapies

          5. Life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer.

          6. World Health Organisation (WHO) Performance status 0-1 (see Appendix III).

          7. One or more measurable lesions of at least 10 mm in the longest diameter by spiral CT
             according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

          8. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated at least 4 weeks prior
             to the date of the experimental treatment and stable without steroid treatment for at
             least 1 week

          2. Radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks before the start of study therapy.

          3. The last dose of prior systemic therapy has been received less than 4 weeks prior the
             start of study therapy.

          4. Major surgery within 4 weeks, or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             study therapy.

          5. Any unresolved toxicity greater than National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0, see Appendix II) grade 2
