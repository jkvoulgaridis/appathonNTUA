  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Infections other than HIV can cause LN inflammation and collagen damage to the
      fibroblastic reticular cell network (FRCn), which will lead to CD4 T cell depletion and
      impaired vaccine responses. This protocol will study yellow fever vaccine (YFV) in two
      cohorts of people, one from Uganda and the other from Minnesota where we collect lymphoid
      tissues (LT) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) before and after vaccination using a new
      technique to catalog infectious burden of the individual, determine the relationship between
      IA, Infections, and immune response.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the difference between antibody titers in the
      two study groups and study the relationship between endemic infections, IA, the FRCn, and CD4
      and CD8 T cell subsets and the magnitude and durability of neutralizing antibody response to
      YFV in a cohort shown to have elevated IA, a damaged FRCn, and pan T cell depletion and a
      cohort that does not. This is a single arm, open-label, two cohort study of healthy adults in
      Kampala, Uganda and in Minnesota, USA. The cohort in Uganda will be 30 adults (15 men and 15
      women) and the cohort in Minnesota will be 16 adults (8 men and 8 women). Everyone will be
      screened to ensure there are no contraindications to receiving YFV (e.g., immunosuppression)
      or the planned procedures. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are discussed in detail in
      the protocol that is included in the appendix. Participants will have an inguinal LN biopsy,
      leukapheresis, and GALT biopsies prior to YFV and again 3 weeks after the vaccine
      administration. The vaccine will be given in the contralateral thigh from the first LN biopsy
      so that the second biopsy will be from a draining LN. PBMC and plasma will be collected at
      regular intervals over the 18-month follow-up period and leukapheresis will be done again at
      the month 18 visit.

             immunosuppressive drug where a live virus vaccine is contraindicated.

          -  If female of childbearing age must agree to contraception for the 2 months prior to
             vaccination and the month following.
