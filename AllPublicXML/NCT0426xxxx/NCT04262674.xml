    <textblock>
      This project develops an innovative screening system and prediction model to detect
      preclinical symptoms of cognitive impairment and predict the potential development of mild
      cognitive impairments and dementia in older adults. The earliest possible detection of
      preclinical symptoms is prerequisite to improve the efficacy of subsequent preventative
      non-pharmacological, life-style and exercise related, personalized treatment interventions.

      BACKGROUND: Early detection of preclinical symptoms and prediction of potential development
      of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) could improve
      non-pharmacologic, life-style and exercise related preventative interventions' efficacy and
      slow-down disease progression. To achieve this goal, discriminating the earliest preclinical
      stage of MCI/AD from healthy state would be necessary. However, this is still challenging and
      current clinical methods are not feasible for preventative screening in larger populations of
      older adults, as they involve invasive sampling of molecular blood or cerebrospinal fluid
      biomarkers, as well as expensive brain imaging and extensive neuropsychological testing.
      Recently, several non-invasive alternative measures, including electroencephalography (EEG),
      gait analysis, heart rate variability (HRV), and core body temperature (Tc), were shown to be
      associated with preclinical symptoms of MCI/AD and to predict disease progression.

      AIM: The investigators aim to combine these measures in a novel non-invasive multi-parameter
      prediction model, which better reflects multimodal symptomatology compared to currently used
      methods and, therefore, allows discriminating healthy persons from MCI state with adequate
      sensitivity (i.e. &gt;80%).

      METHODS: A cohort of 85 older adults, ≥65 years of age, including healthy persons and
      patients with MCI, will be recruited. Assessments will be performed at baseline, after 2
      months (within these two 2 months one group will follow a cognitive-motor training
      intervention, while the other serves as passive control), and at 12-month follow-up.
      Assessments include EEG, gait analysis, HRV, and Tc at rest and during walking, and will be
      compared to reference measures of MCI status, including neuropsychological tests, to develop
      the prediction model and evaluate its sensitivity.
