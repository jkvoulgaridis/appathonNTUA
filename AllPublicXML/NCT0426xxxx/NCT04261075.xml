    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to determine the dose
      of IPH5201 that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab +/- oleclumab in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      Study D6770C00001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and
      immunogenicity of IPH5201 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors, when administered as
      monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab ± oleclumab.
