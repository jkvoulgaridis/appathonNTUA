    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Diabetic Care Self-Management
      Mobile Health Application in behavioral modification i.e foot care behaviour and dietary
      behaviour among diabetic clients in Malaysia. Diabetic Care Self-Management Mobile Health
      Application is a mobile health (mHealth) application program aiming for primary care in
      health prevention and promotion activity. The program is developed by the researcher through
      the literature review conducted. The program is evaluated through a randomized controlled
      trial study design.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot Care Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks; Baseline on Week 1 and follow up on Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The changes of foot care behaviour will be measured twice (Week 1 and Week 5) by using Diabetic Foot Selfcare Behaviour Scale (DFSBS). The questionnaire consist of two parts namely Part 1 and Part 2 with two set of different responses. In Part 1, there are four different questions measuring the self-care activity. The response for this Part 1 consists of days performed from 0 - 7 days. The response will be categorized based on Likert Scale according to the following categories; 0 days for score of 1, 1-2 days for score of 2, 3-4 days for score of 3, 5-6 days for score of 4 and 7 days for score of 5. In Part 2, the question responses are categorized as never (1), seldom (2), sometimes (3), frequently (4) and always (5). The total score accumulated will be in range of 7 - 35. The interpretation of the score will be the higher the score, the better the foot care behaviour.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks; Baseline in Week 1 and follow up in Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The changes of dietary behaviour will be measured twice (Week 1 and Week 5) by using translated Dietary Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ). The questionnaire consists of 30 items with four domains. The domains are selecting a healthy diet with 13 items; arranging a meal plan, 7 items; recognizing the amount of calorie needs, 5 items and managing dietary behaviour challenges, 5 items. 5 points of Likert scale is use from 0 to 4 with 0 for never, 1 for seldom, 2 for occasionally, 3 for often and 4 for repeatedly. The total score of DBQ is ranging from 0 to 120 with score of 0 to 40 categorized as poor behaviour, 41 to 80 categorized as medium and 81 to 120 categorized as better dietary behaviour.</description>

    <measure>Foot Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks; baseline in Week 1 and post intervention in Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The foot conditions will be assessed twice (Week 1 and Week 5) by using foot condition assessment form.</description>

    <measure>Fasting Blood Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks; baseline in Week 1 and post intervention in Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The level of fasting blood glucose will be assessed twice (Week 1 and Week 5) by withdrawing participants blood for the test.The test will be sent to a certified laboratory for the analysis of FBG reading. Prior to blood taking procedure, the participants will be asked to fast.</description>

    <description>In day 1, the participant will receive a Foot Care Kit consist of a mirror, a tube of lotion, a small towel, and a nail clipper. The participant will enrol in 3-hour workshop for general management of diabetes mellitus, diabetic foot care and dietary management. The participant will be invited to install Diabetes Care Self-Management Mobile Health Application. The mobile application is meant for sources of referral for diabetic foot care and dietary care, and for record purpose (diary) of any foot care activities carried out that participant needs to enter in the application during his/her home. The participant will be trained for the use of Diabetes Care Mobile Health Application. In addition, the participant will be invited to join a WhatsApp group for the medium of communication. The program will be lasting for 5 weeks.</description>

             Inlow's 60 Second Diabetic Foot Screen.

          -  Age of 18 to 65 years old. Since the study is using mobile health applications,
             technology literate is an important factor to see the effect of mHealth on behaviour
             modification process. If the patient is more than 65 years old, the patient might have
             some difficulties in using mobile health intervention. Meanwhile, for the patient less
             than 18 years old, guardian permission is required prior to study enrolment.

          -  Have difficulty in performing foot care during in the middle of the intervention
             period. For example, the client may get sick due to hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic
