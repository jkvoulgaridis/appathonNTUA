  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although craniotomy provides a more complete evacuation of the acute epidural hematoma, there
      are insufficient data to support specific surgical treatment method. We aim to perform a
      multi-center, parallel-group randomized clinical trial to compare the outcome and
      cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy versus craniotomy for the treatment of
      traumatic brain injury patients with cerebral herniation undergoing evacuation of an acute
      epidural hematoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of epidural hematoma (EDH) among traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients has been
      reported to be in the range of 2.7 to 4%. Among patients in coma, up to 9% harbored an EDH
      requiring craniotomy. The mortality in patients in all age groups and GCS scores undergoing
      surgery for evacuation of EDH is approximately 10%. The decision to operate on an acute EDH
      (AEDH) is usually based on the patient's GCS score, age, pupillary abnormalities,
      comorbidities, CT findings, associated intracranial lesions, in delayed decisions, the time
      between neurological deterioration and surgery, and intracranial pressure. An AEDH greater
      than 30 ml should be surgically evacuated regardless of the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale
      (GCS) score. There are insufficient data to support one surgical treatment method. However,
      craniotomy provides a more complete evacuation of the hematoma for patients with an AEDH that
      require an operation to remove the clot. But whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) should be
      employed still has considerable controversy. The choice of operative technique is influenced
      by the surgeon's expertise, training, and evaluation of a particular situation. The
      difference between these two procedures is that a bone flap is left out before closing the
      skin in DC. Both approaches are widely used among neurological surgeons (although the
      indications may differ), therefore there is sufficient experience in the centers to set up a
      randomized clinical trial.

    <description>The primary outcome is indicated by the long-term functional outcomes, including overall mortality and the score on the &quot;Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale&quot; (GOS-E). &quot;Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale&quot; is the unabbreviated scale title, minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 8, which was scored as follows and higher scores mean a better outcome:
death;
persistent vegetative state;
lower severe disability;
upper severe disability (stratum 3 and 4 were considered as severe disability, with permanent requirement for help with daily living);
lower moderate disability;
upper moderate disability (stratum 5 and 6 were considered as mild disability, without a need for assistance in everyday life, that might, however, require special equipment for employment);
lower good recovery;
upper good recovery (stratum 7 and 8 were considered as good recovery).</description>

    <description>Serious adverse events (SAE) is defined as an untoward occurrence that:

    <description>Unabbreviated scale title is &quot;5-level EuroQol five dimensions&quot; questionnaire. The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for describing and valuing health. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <description>A large bone flap must be raised. The evacuation of epidural hematoma is depended on surgeon's preference. However, the bone flap must be replaced and fixed with fixation system (plates and screws). The patient will not need an additional operation to rebuild the skull in the future. But undisciplinable brain swelling and increased intracranial pressure may happen in some patients, and additional decompressive craniectomy is recommended in these cases.</description>

          3. Patients who had injury of the oculomotor nerve;

          4. Patients are considered to be operated mainly by following pathological change on CT:

             because of epidural hematoma;

          5. Severe pre-existing disability or severe co-morbidity which would lead to a poor
