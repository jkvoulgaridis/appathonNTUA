    <textblock>
      Study to determine the potential pharmacokinetic interaction of ramipril (and ramiprilat),
      atorvastatin as atorvastatin calcium trihydrate and amlodipine as amlodipine besilate at
      steady state after a multiple oral administration and to monitor the safety of the
      co-administration of these drugs. This study aims to determine if the steady state study
      pharmacokinetic parameters of any of the given drugs and the tolerability is altered when
      administered concomitantly.

      This study was an open-label, comparative, multiple-dose, fixed sequence steady state trial
      to compare the pharmacokinetic of ramipril, atorvastatin as atorvastatin calcium trihydrate,
      amlodipine as amlodipine besilate given as a multiple dose under fasting conditions in the
      absence and presence of each other.

      Bioanalysis of ramipril, ramiprilat, atorvastatin and amlodipine is performed by LC/MS/MS
      method.
