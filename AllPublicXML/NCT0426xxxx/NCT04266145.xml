  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering increases the cardiac and systemic energy expenditure, oxygen consumption and
      carbon dioxide production. Definitive prevention and treatment of shivering is necessary to
      decrease the related complications and increase post-anesthetic comfort.

      Dexmedetomidine a highly selective α2 adrenergic agonist used effectively as a safe analgesic
      via different routes and mechanisms, including intravenous (i.v.), neuraxial and perineural
      routes. Dexmedetomidine has been used for prevent shivering but, the results of its efficacy
      is still controversy.

      No studies to date have investigated the best administration route of dexmedetomidine to
      dominantly prevent the occurrence of shivering after spinal anesthesia or associated with the
      least grade.

      This prospective, randomized, double blinded study was designed to investigate the best
      administrative route of dexmedetomidine firstly, as a preventive of neuraxial shivering and
      secondly as adjunctive analgesic.

      The incidence of post-spinal anesthesia shivering was the primary outcome. Perioperative
      hemodynamics, postoperative pain scores during rest and at 45-degree flexion of the knee, the
      analgesic duration, the first postoperative day analgesic consumption, the sedation score and
      early ambulation ability were the secondary outcomes.
