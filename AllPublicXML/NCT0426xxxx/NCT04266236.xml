  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful orthopedic procedures to
      effectively relieve pain and restore function in patients with hip osteoarthritis,
      osteonecrosis of femoral head and hip fracture.The Lumbar Plexus Block (LPB) is currently
      used as the standard regional anesthesia technique to provide postoperative pain management
      after THA. The lumbar plexus (LP) originates from T12 to L5. In general, multiple-needle
      nerve blockade procedure is needed to block different branches of LP. Therefore, we need more
      time to finish the regional anethesia procedure and it's not easy for an inexperienced
      anesthesiologist to master the technique absolutely. In addition, multiple injections will
      increase the discomfort of the patients. We aim to investigate the effects of lumbar plexus
      combined with quadratus lumborum block using single-needle technique with Shamrock method as
      an alternative regional anesthesia.
