  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is to evaluate the satisfaction of patient and postoperative functional vision of
      unilateral or bilateral Implantation of intraocular lens（IOLs） in cataract patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will undergo uneventful phacoemulsification and implantation of IOL.

      The subjects will be divided into two groups . The unilateral cataract patients in the Group
      1 will undergo unilateral surgery, and the bilateral cataract patients in the Group 2 will
      undergo bilateral surgery. IOL may be monofocal,bifocal ,or trifocal，according to the
      patients preference and the eyes condition. In each group, the subjects will be divided into
      three subgroups according to the type of the IOLs.Compare binocular functional vision and the
      satisfaction of patient between the two groups at postoperative 3 months.Compare binocular
      functional vision and the satisfaction of patient with different IOLs among the subgroups.

    <measure>monocular and binocular visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA), intermediate visual acuity, near visual acuity will be measured at 5m, 80cm and 40cm respectively. All visual acuity measurements will be conducted under photopic conditions (85 cd/m2) and at 100% contrast</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binocular Contrast sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity measures will be conducted binocularly, under photopic, mesopic (5 cd/m2), photopic with glare and mesopic with glare conditions, with the OPTEC 6500 contrast sensitivity test (Stereo Optical, USA). Contrast sensitivity will be evaluated at five spatial frequencies (1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree [cpd]). Patients will be allowed 5 minutes to adapt to each illumination level before testing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binocular Defocus Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Binocular defocus curves will be obtained in all patients, positioned at 5m under photopic (&gt;85 cd/m 2 ) condition to measure the visual acuity with each defocus lens, representing the consecutive visual function of each eye. Negative lenses were added in 0.50 D steps and the visual acuity will be recorded for each type of defocus level. The procedure will be then repeated but with positive lenses. The range of defocus evaluated is from -4.00D to +2.00D.</description>
