  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation in
      conjunction with nCPAP, in comparison to nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates with RDS, as
      assessed by the incidence of and time to respiratory failure and/or death due to RDS in the
      first 72 hours and 28 days of life. Half of the subjects will receive lucinactant for
      inhalation and half will receive standard of care (nCPAP alone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An unmet medical need exists for a means to deliver SRT to preterm neonates with RDS
      supported with nCPAP early in the course of the disease. This strategy has the potential to
      improve RDS prior to the development of respiratory failure, thereby avoiding the need for
      endotracheal intubation and MV, or reduce the duration of MV, and the resultant potential for
      morbidity and complications. The ability to administer SRT via aerosol has the potential to
      address this unmet need.

      Lucinactant for inhalation (AEROSURF) is an investigational drug-device combination product,
      designed to deliver aerosolized SRT to preterm neonates with RDS who are being supported with
      nCPAP. The drug component of lucinactant for inhalation is lyophilized lucinactant, a
      lyophilized form of SURFAXIN® (lucinactant) Intratracheal Suspension. The device component,
      the AEROSURF Delivery System (ADS), the next-generation device following use of the prototype
      device in earlier trials, uses novel technology to aerosolize lucinactant for inhalation.

      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation in conjunction
      with nCPAP, in comparison to nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates with RDS, as assessed by
      pre-specified outcome measures. In addition, this study will evaluate the device and the
      ability to administer up to 3 repeat doses.
