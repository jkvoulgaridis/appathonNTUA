  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, prospective, non-randomized, open-label trial involving cancer patients
      with known inflamed tumor types. Patients with previously treated advanced/metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer will be recruited in near equal distribution.
      All patients must have documented response or prolonged stable disease to previous
      immunotherapy. At present, we plan to enrol 55 patients, to be treated with durvalumab and
      oleclumab. The regimen will consist of durvalumab 1500 mg given by vein every 4 weeks and
      oleclumab 3000 mg given by vein every 2 weeks x 4 doses then IV every 4 weeks till disease
      progression, withdrawal of subject consent, or another reason for discontinuation. Estimated
      total duration from time to first subjects consent to last subject's last visit is
      approximately 36 months.

      Study Hypotheses:

        1. Circulating free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing
           (cfMeDIP-seq) can yield cancer type-agnostic predictive biomarker(s) of response and/or
           toxicity in subjects receiving this combination.

        2. The combination of oleclumab (anti-cluster of differentiation [CD]73 monoclonal
           antibody) with durvalumab (anti programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) will demonstrate
           adequate safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity in subjects with metastatic
           non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell cancer (RCC) previously treated with
           checkpoint inhibitors.

    <description>Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against human PD-L1. Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 with high affinity and blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and cluster of differentiation (CD)80. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediating antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.</description>

    <description>Oleclumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 lambda monoclonal antibody (mAb) with a triple mutation in the heavy chain constant region for reduced effector function. Oleclumab selectively binds to cluster of differentiation 73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) (CD73) and inhibits CD73-associated ectonucleotidase activity, thereby inhibiting the CD73-mediated production of immunosuppressive adenosine. Extracellular adenosine contributes to the immunosuppressive effects of both regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, among others. This, in turn, leads to increased antitumor immunity.</description>
