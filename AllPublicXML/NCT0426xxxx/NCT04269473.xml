  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized control trial, participants with running-related knee pain will be
      randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. Participants in the
      intervention group will receive a telehealth gait retraining intervention, an at-home
      exercise program, a return to running protocol, and standard physical therapy. Participants
      in the control group will receive an at-home exercise program, a return to running protocol,
      and standard physical therapy. Data will be collected before intervention, at 10-weeks, and
      at 14-weeks to determine efficacy of the intervention.

    <intervention_name>Telehealth Gait Retraining</intervention_name>
    <description>Telehealth gait retraining is a novel approach to train participants to adopt a non-rearfoot foot strike pattern during running via telecommunications. During telehealth gait retraining, video of a participant's running form are sent to clinicians over a mobile device app and running form feedback is given. This process is repeated once a week for four weeks and then every other week until week 8.</description>
