      The objectives of this study are:

      Part 1:

        -  To assess the MTD, safety and efficacy of each NYH817G and NYH100P in monotherapy in
           patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed approved standard therapies.

        -  To assess the PK properties and the preliminary effectiveness of monotherapy of NYH817G
           and NYH100P.

      Part 2:

        -  To assess the MTD, RP2D, safety and efficacy of NYH817G and NYH100P in combination
           therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed approved standard
           therapies

        -  To assess the PK properties, the preliminary effectiveness and the changes in metabolism
           of combination therapy of NYH817G and NYH100P.
