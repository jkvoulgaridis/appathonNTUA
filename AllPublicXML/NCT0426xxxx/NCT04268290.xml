  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for colorectal cancer has been demonstrated to be
      safe and feasible and present minimally invasive benefits including faster recovery, reduced
      postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay, also acquiring comparable oncologic outcomes
      with open surgery. To achieve further minimally invasive outcomes, SILS plus one port surgery
      was attempted by some surgeons. Preliminary results showed that SILS+1 could achieve better
      minimally invasive benefits than CLS while preserving oncologic feasibility.

      Till now, ERAS has been practiced in colorectal cancer surgery for approximately 20 years.
      Studies have proven that ERAS is safe and significantly improved the recovery course of
      patients during perioperative period, meanwhile, the expense could be greatly reduced.

      Based on ERAS studies protocols and SILS+1 trials, investigators tried to combine SILS+1 with
      ERAS, hopefully to provide patients with more safe, economic, feasible and rapid surgery and
      perioperative strategies.

    <description>Preoperative:
preadmission information, education, counseling, optimization ( breathing training), shortening fasting time and carbohydrate load
Intraoperative:
The intravenous fluid therapy is restricted. All patients undergo single incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery(SILS plus one).
A suitable warming device (such as forced-air heating blankets) and warmed intravenous fluids are been adopted routinely to keep body temperature
Postoperative:
multimodal analgesia (surgical site infiltration, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, epidural analgesia) early oral intake and move. nasogastric tubes should not be used routinely. Nasogastric tubes inserted during surgery are been removed before reversal of an aesthesia.</description>
