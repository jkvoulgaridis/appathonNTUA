  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two of the most effective lifestyle-based approaches to reduce the risk of adverse health
      events and enhance quality of life with aging are exercise and a healthy diet. Currently, the
      Canadian recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day, however, several
      expert groups have advocated for a higher RDA of protein (~1.2 g/kg/day), along with more
      evenly distributed daily consumption, in older persons. Eggs are considered a nutrient-rich
      protein source but have recently been scrutinized. This study will compare a high-protein,
      egg-containing diet and a high-protein, non-egg diet in healthy older persons.

      This study will examine the impacts of an egg-containing diet and a non-egg diet in healthy
      older persons. Briefly, participants (healthy persons, age 60-75 years old) will consume
      their normal diet or their normal diet plus 4 eggs completing a structured exercise program
      (designed to meet Canada's Physical Activity Guidelines) for a total of 12 weeks.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to the Egg or Control (non-egg) group. Before and
      after the 12-week intervention, participants' undergo assessments of diet-quality, muscle
      health, fitness, bone health, and vascular health.
