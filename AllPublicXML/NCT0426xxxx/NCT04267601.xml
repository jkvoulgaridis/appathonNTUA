      Subjects will visit the site on the 12th week (Visit 2) and 24th week (Visit 3) from the
      registration date (Visit 1) to confirm the efficacy and safety.

      Primary endpoint

      - HbA1c change after 24 weeks treatment

      Secondary endpoint

        -  Average rate of change in HbA1c after baseline

        -  Ratio of subjects with HbA1c&lt;7% after 24 weeks

        -  Ratio of subjects with HbA1c&lt;6.5% after 24 weeks

        -  Subgroup analysis by gender, age, BMI, medical history, renal function, liver function,
           conventional DPP4 inhibitors therapy, concomitant Oral Antidiabetic Drug, duration of
           disease
