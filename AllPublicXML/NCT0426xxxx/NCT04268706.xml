  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous CD30.CAR-T in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory CD30+ classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will have blood drawn to manufacture the CD30.CAR-T
      cells in a lab. CD30.CAR-T cells will be infused after the completion of lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.

      Subjects will be monitored for safety and efficacy throughout the study. Subjects will be
      followed for survival, withdrawal of consent or study closure, whichever occurs first.

      Health Related Quality of Life assessments will be collected for pediatric and adult patients
      during the study.
