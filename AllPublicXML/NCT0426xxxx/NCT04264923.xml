      Stool samples will be collected before and during the HyGIeaCare procedure and the samples
      will be sent for microbiome evaluation.

      Patients will have the HyGIeaCare procedure as originally prescribed by their physician.
      Before and during the procedure stool samples will be collected and sent to a lab for
      microbiome evaluation.

      It is anticipated that stool samples collected from the HyGIeaCare prep will provide more
      microbiological and biochemical information on the gut interior than using traditional stool
      samples.
