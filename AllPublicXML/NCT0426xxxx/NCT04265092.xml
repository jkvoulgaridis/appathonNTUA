      Introduction/Objectives: In this observational study, we assessed the benefit following an
      injection of 200 international units (IU) of incobotulinum toxinA in patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) with spasticity of the triceps surae (TS) at 6 weeks (peak efficacy of toxin)
      and at 3 months (cancellation of efficacy).

      Methods: This study enrolled all MS patients willing to participate with Expanded Disability
      Status Scale (EDSS) scores of less than 6, who required toxin for management of focal
      spasticity of the TS. Treatment consisted of 200 IU of incobotulinum toxinA injected into the
      TS. Outcome measures were assessed before injection, at 6 weeks and 3 months post-injection,
      using the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), Twelve Item MS Walking (MSWS-12) Scale, Timed Up and
      Go (TUG) Test, 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Spatiotemporal gait data was obtained by GAITRite.

    <measure>Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion, at 6 weeks, at three months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 MWT is a simple test which requires a 30-meter course, calm, indoors, flat, in a rectilinear rectangular corridor. The route is marked every 3 meters with colored marks. The U-turn should be viewed with a cone. The purpose of this test is to walk as much as possible for 6 minutes. The score is between 0 meters for a non-ambulatory person and about 900 meters for a healthy subject.</description>

    <measure>the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion, at 6 weeks, at three months</time_frame>
    <description>From the numbers circled against these questions, the healthcare professional can calculate the MSWS-12 score. This is done by adding the numbers you have circled, giving a total out of 60, and then transforming this to a scale with a range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a greater impact on walking than lower scores.</description>

    <measure>the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) score with determination</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion, at 6 weeks, at three months</time_frame>
    <description>In collaboration with the patient, the doctor define a primary and a secondary objectives, with a specific mark for each: -2: worse than before, -1: no change, 0: objective achieved, 1: result better than expected, 2: unexpected result</description>

    <measure>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>

    <description>TUG performance is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates &quot;normal functioning&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;severe abnormal behavior&quot;, according to the individual's perception of the risk of falling (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991) . The score consists of the time taken to complete the test, in seconds.</description>

        Twenty-two MS patients with a mean age of 48.2 +/- 12 years were enrolled in this study, 15
        women and 7 men. In 13 patients, the disease had been in a relapsing-remitting mode for
        15.2 +/- 12 years, 4 patients had secondary-progressive disease and 5 had primary
        progressive disease, with a mean EDSS of 4.2 +/- 1.5. Triceps surae spasticity on the
        Modified Ashworth Scale was 2.4 +/- 0.7.
