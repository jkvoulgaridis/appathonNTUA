  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial will use a pilot sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART)
      to examine protocol feasibility and acceptability of new components of a web-based
      intervention for socially anxious smokers. This study will be used to help build an adaptive
      treatment strategy to improve engagement with and effectiveness of the web-based
      intervention. Adaptive treatment strategies provide individualized sequences of intervention
      components to accommodate the changing needs of individuals based on their characteristics,
      treatment response, or engagement.

      This study proposes to use a pilot SMART to help build an adaptive treatment strategy to
      improve engagement with and effectiveness of a web-based intervention for socially anxious
      smokers. At the outset of the study (Phase 1), participants will receive access to a new
      web-based smoking intervention (MyWebQuit) and will randomized to receive one of two text
      message services: 1) 1-way text messages, or 2) interactive, 2-way text messages. Those who
      disengage with the website in the first 5 weeks will be re-randomized to one of three
      re-engagement strategies: 1) re-engagement emails, 2) re-engagement interactive text
      messages, or 3) no re-engagement strategy. Outcomes include protocol feasibility, treatment
      acceptability, treatment utilization, and smoking cessation.
