      The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the Care &amp; Organize
      Our Lifestyle (COOL) program, a self-regulation theory-based mHealth program, on improving
      disease knowledge and physical activity in youth with congenital heart disease (CHD). The
      COOL program is a 12-month randomized controlled trial that compared two active intervention
      groups to a standard-care control group (n = 47). Participants with simple and moderate CHD
      aged 15-24 years were recruited from pediatric or adult CHD outpatient departments.
      Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL Passport, a
      mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided with access to
      the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms along with COOL
      Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for CHD and the International
      Physical Activity Questionnaire—Taiwan Show-Card Version.

      Background: Mobile health initiatives may provide youth with congenital heart disease (CHD)
      relevant health information and a platform for managing the complex health care needs
      associated with undergoing transitional care.

      Aims: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the Care &amp; Organize Our Lifestyle (COOL)
      program, a self-regulation theory-based mHealth program, on improving disease knowledge and
      physical activity in youth with CHD.

      Methods: The COOL program is a 12-month randomized controlled trial that compared two active
      intervention groups to a standard-care control group (n = 47). Participants with simple and
      moderate CHD aged 15-24 years were recruited from pediatric or adult CHD outpatient
      departments. Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL
      Passport, a mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided
      with access to the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms
      along with COOL Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for CHD and the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Taiwan Show-Card Version.
