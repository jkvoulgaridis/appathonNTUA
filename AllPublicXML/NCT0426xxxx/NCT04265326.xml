  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary treatment option of many patients with head and neck cancer is surgery,
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In the literature, functional problems that occur after
      surgical interventions applied to head and neck cancer patients are frequently mentioned.
      Morbidities resulting from the combined application of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are
      based on more anecdotal information and critical data on long-term functional outcomes in
      this patient group are scarce. The aim of this study is to make the validity, reliability and
      cultural adaptation of the Head and Neck Cancer Inventory in Turkish.

    <textblock>
      In the literature, there are general cancer scales developed to evaluate the quality of life
      of head and neck cancer patients and sub scales associated with head and neck cancers
      developed in addition to these scales. In addition, scales specific to head and neck cancers
      have also been developed. However, previous research shows that even general health status
      scales or cancer-specific scales cannot determine outcomes related to many head and neck
      cancer patients. In addition, items containing multiple functions and patients' attitudes
      (behaviors) cannot be analyzed separately in any of the scales specific to head and neck
      cancer. Very few surveys contain items related to patients' attitudes (behaviors), or the
      number of items related to this topic is small because most of these scales are functional
      items. Unlike its counterparts in the literature, Head and Neck Cancer Inventory evaluates
      the attitudes (behaviors) of patients associated with various functions in daily life. Head
      and Neck Cancer Inventory is the only scale in the literature that contains the basic
      features of the health conditions declared by the patient and has been developed specifically
      for head and neck cancer.

    <description>It is a scale consisting of 30 items in total, containing 4 main categories [speech (10 items), eating (10 items), aesthetics (2 items), social disorders (7 items)] evaluating the quality of life related to head and neck cancer and an additional item evaluating the overall quality of life. This inventory reflects both functionality (how functional the patient is) and attitudes (how satisfied is the patient's functional level) using a 5-point Likert-type scale. This scale does not have a summary score representing all items, the score of 4 different categories can be calculated. The higher the scores, the better the quality of life [2].</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the 27-item Cancer Treatment Functional Evaluation-General (FACT-G) scale, this scale consists of 9 additional items specific to head and neck cancer. FACT G consists of 4 main categories that evaluate physical (7 items), social (7 items), emotional (6 items) and functional status (7 items). Each item is scored by patients with a Likert type classification ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (too many). Points are calculated separately for each category. A summary score is also calculated for FACT-G and total FACT-H &amp; N [3]. The questionnaire is available in Turkish version [9].</description>
