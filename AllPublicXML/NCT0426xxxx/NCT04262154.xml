  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out whether adding the study drug atezolizumab and stereotactic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT) to standard treatment with abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and Lupron®
      (leuprolide) is a safe and effective way to treat previously untreated metastatic prostate
      cancer, and to see whether the study treatment works better than the standard treatment.
