  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of 3 intra-nodal injections of GAD-alum (Diamyd),
      together with oral vitamin D supplementation. Safety and feasibility of the treatment will be
      evaluated and also effects on the immune system and on the preservation of endogenous insulin
      production.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent by the patient.

          2. Diagnosis of LADA within the last 12 months before inclusion. LADA should be defined
             by the criteria of age ≥30 years at the onset of diabetes, anti-GAD positivity and no
             clinical need for insulin treatment during the first 6 months after the diagnosis of
             diabetes.

          3. Fasting C-peptid levels ≥ 0.3 nmol/l

          4. High GADA titers (&gt;190 U/ml)

          5. Patients must be insulin independent at baseline by clinical judgement and C-peptide
             criteria

          6. Antidiabetic medication in the form of metformin is acceptable for inclusion as well
             as medications not mentioned under exclusion criteria

          7. Females must agree to avoid pregnancy, and must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

        Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception, until one (1)
        year after the last administration of GAD-alum. Adequate contraception is as follows:

        For females of childbearing potential:

          1. oral (except low‐dose gestagen (lynestrenol and norestisteron)), injectable, or
             implanted hormonal contraceptives

          2. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)

          3. oral, intravaginal or transdermal progesterone hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation

          4. intrauterine device

          5. intrauterine hormone-releasing system (for example, progestin‐releasing coil)

          6. bilateral tubal occlusion

          7. vasectomized male (with appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence of
             sperm in the ejaculate)

          8. male partner using condom

          9. abstinence from heterosexual intercourse

        For males of childbearing potential:

          1. condom (male)

          2. abstinence from heterosexual intercourse

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or previous treatment with immunosuppressant therapy (topical or inhaled
             steroids are accepted)

          2. Continuous treatment with anti-inflammatory drug (sporadic treatment e.g. because of
             headache or in connection with fever a few days will be accepted)

          3. Systemic treatment with glucocorticoids

          4. Treatment with any vaccine, including influenza vaccine, within 4 months prior to
             planned first study drug dose or planned treatment with any vaccine up to 4 months
             after the last injection with study drug

          5. Antidiabetic medication (metformin excepted)

          6. Significantly abnormal hematology results at screening (i.e. anemia with hemoglobin &lt;
             12 g/L).

          7. A history of epilepsy, head trauma or cerebrovascular accident, or clinical features
             of continuous motor unit activity in proximal muscles

          8. Clinically significant history of acute reaction to vaccines in the past.

          9. Renal disease (as defined by serum creatinine &gt;150 µmol/l)

         10. Serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) within the last year
             preceding recruitment.

         11. Participation in other clinical trials with a new chemical entity within the previous
             3 months

         12. A history of alcohol or drug abuse

         13. Known HIV or hepatitis

         14. Presence of associated serious disease or condition, including active skin infections
             that preclude intralymphatic injection, which in the opinion of the investigator makes
             the patient non-eligible for the study

         15. Other serious chronic disease as judged by investigator.

         16. Females who are lactating, are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.

         17. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the provisions of this protocol

             study protocol

         19. Treatment with vitamin D, marketed or not, or unwilling to abstain from such
             medication during the trial
