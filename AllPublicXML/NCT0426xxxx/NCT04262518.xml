  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the role of a mobile health app, Outcomes4Me, in the
      navigation of care for people with breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a single arm pilot study of a novel breast cancer navigation app that is
      intended to assist patients with breast cancer understand their diagnosis and treatment
      options (both as part of standard of care practice and clinical trials) and manage their
      care, through treatment and symptom tracking. Patients will also be able to share information
      and get news via the app relevant to their cancer subtype. Results from this intervention
      will inform future clinical integration efforts, improve patient-centeredness of such an
      app-based health content and data platform, and inform the design of a larger, randomized
      study to demonstrate an improvement in patients' outcomes as well as enhanced Real-World
      Evidence (RWE) data collection.

    <measure>Measure # of times a patient logs into the Outcomes4Me app over a 12 week period</measure>

    <description>We will track engagement with the app by tracking the number of times a user logs in to the Outcomes4Me app over a 12 week period. The app will be considered feasible if at least 40% of enrolled patients engage with the Outcomes4Me app at least 3 times during the 12-week study period.</description>

    <measure>Measure System-Usability Score (SUS) of app usage</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Usability will be assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS). We wil collect the input of breast cancer patients to the SUS questions, using in-app surveys and will calculate the SUS score. We will assess overall satisfaction with the app by asking users to provide an answer to the question &quot;How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend&quot; on a scale of 0-10.</description>
