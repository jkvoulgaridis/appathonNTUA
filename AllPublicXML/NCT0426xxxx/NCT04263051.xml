  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related
      mortality both in men and women worldwide.

      The past few years have demonstrated great progress in the field of tumor immunotherapy
      through agents that address mechanisms of immune escape notably, so called immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICB). Indeed, ICB have emerged as a fatal weapon in the anticancer treatment
      arsenal. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have shown promising results in several cancers
      including Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although such ICB extend patient's
      survival compared with conventional systemic therapies, they fail to control cancer
      progression in a significant proportion of patients which can reach up to 50-60% in NSCLC.
      Recent literature highlights a range of factors involved in the heterogeneous responses and
      failures to ICB therapies. The challenge is how can ICB treatment efficacy be extended to
      majority patients? To respond to this question, to increase the success of immunotherapy,
      immuno-oncology community develops combinations approaches.

      The aim of these project is to evaluate the efficacy of Nivolumab plus a novel CD4Th1 inducer
      anti-cancer vaccine in NSCLC patients.

      Nivolumab (NIVO), which is an anti-PD-1 antibody, has shown promising results in 2nd line
      treatment for advanced NSCLC.

      UCPVax is a therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine based on the telomerase-derived helper peptides
      designed to induce strong TH1 CD4 T cell responses in cancer patients (NCT02818426).
