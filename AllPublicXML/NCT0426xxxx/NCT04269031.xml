  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to assess the the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      AZD2373, following subcutaneous (SC) administration of single ascending doses (SAD) of
      AZD2373 in healthy male subjects of African ancestry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind
      study to assess the effect of AZD2373 following ascending dose sequential group design
      administrations to healthy male subjects of African ancestry. The study will include 6 single
      dose cohorts with the option to include 2 additional cohorts based on emerging data from
      preceding cohorts in the study.

      Approximately 48 male subjects aged 18 to 50 years at the time of informed consent
      (inclusive) will be randomized with the aim to have 8 subjects participate in each cohort.
      Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive AZD2373 and 2 subjects will receive placebo.

      Sentinel dosing will be applied for each cohort and will be divided into 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 (sentinel group): 1 active, 1 placebo;

        -  Group 2 (the rest of the cohort): 5 active, 1 placebo. The safety data of up to 72 hours
           post-dose in Group 1 will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator (PI) before the
           subjects in Group 2 are dosed.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;

        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the
           day before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration (Day 1) until at least
           72 hours after IMP administration; discharged from the Clinical Unit on Day 4;

        -  Follow-up Visits on 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 weeks (Visits 3 to 10); and

        -  A Final Follow up Visit 10 weeks after the last IMP dose.

      The expected duration for any subject participating in the study is approximately 10 weeks
      (excluding an up to 28-day Screening Period).

          -  Subjects with known ancestry outside of West Africa.

          -  History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             drugs.

          -  Any clinically important illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks
             prior to administration of IMP on Study Day 1.

          -  Any laboratory values with the following deviations:

               1. Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than upper limit
                  of normal and clinically significant as determined by the PI.

               2. White blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 3.5 x10^9/L.

               3. Hemoglobin (Hb) below lower limit normal .

          -  Any clinically important abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology or urinalysis
