  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NEONEC is a single-phase, phase II study evaluating the efficacy of the 12-month neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients with locally differentiated digestive NEC. The recommended
      chemotherapy is based on the current reference combination of platinum (cisplatin or
      carboplatin) and etoposide (VP16). For anorectal locations, radiochemotherapy is proposed to
      avoid the morbidity of conventional surgery.

      The objective of the study is to improve relapse-free survival (RFS) in NEC patients treated
      with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery or chemoradiotherapy.

      In parallel, we will perform a prospective cohort study with patients whose diagnosis is made
      during surgery, who have not received neoadjuvant treatment, and who are offered an adjuvant
      treatment of the same type (combination of platinum and platinum salts and etoposide).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 48 patients is to be included in phase II and 30 patients in prospective cohort
      during the inclusion period of phase II.

      Phase II study treatment:

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Administration of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (3 months) with platinum
      based chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin, at the choice of the investigator) + etoposide.

      Surgery or chemoradiotherapy depending on the tumor localization (the irradiation modalities
      and associated chemotherapy treatment will be left to the discretion of the referring
      radiotherapists according to current recommendations for each localization).

      Prospective cohort:

        -  Surgery (prior to study entry)

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy : Administration of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (3 months) with
           platinum based chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin, at the choice of the
           investigator) + etoposide.
