  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior has been linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and is
      particularly common in older adults with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this observational,
      mixed-methods study is to better understand the relationship between prolonged sedentary
      behavior and cardiovascular and metabolic health in older women.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 20 women age 60-75 years, n=10 with uncomplicated type 2
      diabetes (T2D) and n=10 healthy controls. Participants will wear two accelerometers and a
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 7 days for objective assessment of physical activity,
      sedentary behavior, and blood glucose, respectively, and complete a graded exercise test
      (cardiorespiratory fitness), assessment of insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamp) and single leg exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy (microvascular function).
      Participants will also complete a semi-structured qualitative interview to understand
      knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and questionnaires to assess the
      relationship between modifiable psychological and behavioral factors and sedentary behavior.

      The aims of the study are to:

        1. Compare objectively-measured, free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior
           between older women with and without T2D.

        2. Evaluate the relationship between prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior,
           cardiorespiratory fitness, glucose control, insulin sensitivity, and skeletal muscle
           microvascular function in older women with and without T2D.

        3. Assess knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and characterize the
           relationship between knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and modifiable
           psychological and behavioral factors in older women with T2D.

        4. Evaluate the relationship between sedentary behavior, mood states, and meaning salience
           during &quot;normal&quot; life and the period of confinement imposed by the COVID-19 epidemic.
