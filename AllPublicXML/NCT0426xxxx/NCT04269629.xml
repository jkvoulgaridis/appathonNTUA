  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an ongoing debate whether antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers and/or
      angiotensin converting Enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors comprises a risk factor for more severe and
      more frequent side-effects during venom immunotherapy (VIT). In the literature, data are
      controversial and originate from case reports or statistically underpowered studies; the
      number of included patients was usually high but the proportion of patients on
      antihypertensive treatment was low ranging from 2-11%.

      The study was conducted as a prospective, observational, European multicenter study. 1319
      patients, aged from 35 to 85 years, with a history of an anaphylactic reaction due to bee or
      wasp stings, were included. The medical history was recorded as well as laboratory parameters
      and data of the VIT-updosing phase. One year after reaching the maintenance dose, possible
      side-effects during VIT as well as the outcome of field stings or sting challenges were
      documented.

    <description>The outcome (systemic reaction to sting or not) of sting challenges and/or field stings will be recorded to identify patients who will not tolerate but react to future stings. These results will be compared between patients not taking antihypertensive (AHT) drugs and patients taking AHT drugs.</description>

    <description>At Visit 1, patients will be included after carefully reviewing all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All data concerning the index sting, laboratory parameters like IgE and tryptase levels and skin test results will be recorded as well as the concomitant diseases and medication. Visit 2 will be performed after VIT updosing is finished. At this Visit data concerning the immunotherapy - premedication, preparation, updosing protocol, the outcome of possible LLR and SR and changes in diseases and medication will be recorded. One year after reaching the maintenance dose, Visit 3 will be performed. At this Visit data concerning the maintenance phase like premedication and possible side effects will be recorded as well as the outcome of insect stings.</description>
