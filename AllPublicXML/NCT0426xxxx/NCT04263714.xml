  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generally, resistance exercise increases muscle mass and strength, and fatigue resistance.
      How resistance exercise achieves these adaptations remains understudied, but what is known is
      that skeletal muscle translates the physical and biochemical stresses of resistance exercise
      into morphological and metabolic adaptations. While resistance exercise activates signaling
      pathways (i.e., proteins) that increase the synthesis of specific proteins to cause
      adaptations, thousands of proteins are likely involved, and their interactions are
      complicated. The investigators aim to study these processes.

    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue, capable of adapting to changes in nutritional
      intake and contractile activity. For instance, resistance exercise results in a mild
      stimulation of rates of muscle protein breakdown (MPB) but a greater stimulation of the rates
      of muscle protein synthesis (MPS). When resistance exercise is performed prior to protein
      ingestion there is a synergistic combination of the two stimuli such that rates of MPS are
      stimulated over and above those of MPB. Thus, repeated bouts of resistance exercise, when
      coupled with protein ingestion, result in the accretion of skeletal muscle protein referred
      to as hypertrophy. Importantly, by changing the nature of the exercise stimulus, it is
      possible to redirect the focus of the type of skeletal muscle proteins that are being
      synthesized. For example, prolonged and repeated lower-load dynamic stimulation of skeletal
      muscle (i.e., endurance exercise training) results in an increase in the expression of
      mitochondrial genes, proteins, and ultimately enhanced mitochondrial content, leading to a
      shift towards an oxidative phenotype, and improved fatigue resistance. Resistance exercise
      training also stimulates the transcription of genes and accrual of new muscle proteins, but
      these genes and proteins are largely associated with the myofibrillar protein fraction, and
      regular resistance exercise leads to muscle hypertrophy and increased force-generating
      capacity. However, during the early stages of exercise training, particularly in
      training-na√Øve participants there is a significant increase in the expression of genes common
      to both modalities of exercise. It is only with sustained exercise training that there is a
      'fine-tuning' of the transcriptome, the protein synthetic response, and then the proteome
      that gives rise to divergent hypertrophic and oxidative phenotypes.
