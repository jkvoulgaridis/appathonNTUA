  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for most patients with
      ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) or with non ST segment elevation
      acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) . In STEMI patients, PCI is advised in all patients in the
      first 12 hours after onset of symptoms, the earlier the better.

      This condition is referred to as &quot;no-reflow phenomenon.&quot; , no-reflow is defined as suboptimal
      myocardial reperfusion through a part of coronary circulation without angiographic evidence
      of mechanical vessel obstruction.

      Effective antiplatelet therapy combining the inhibition of both thromboxane A2-dependent
      platelet aggregation and P2Y12 receptors is necessary in patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI), particularly those with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI).

      The goal of DAPT (Aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitors) is to reduce the risk of ischemic
      events such as (re)-infarction and the risk of stent thrombosis after PCI. It is logical to
      assume that early administration of a P2Y12 inhibitor prior to PCI (referred to as
      pre-treatment) should provide greater benefit given the fact that even the fastest acting
      oral P2Y12 inhibitors take at least 30-60 min.

      Various studies and meta-analyses suggested that pretreatment with Clopidogrel in patients
      with STEMI could reduce the rate of ischemic events without excess bleeding, but its
      effectiveness may be limited by its slow onset of action and the variable response. In
      contrast, the new oral P2Y12-receptor antagonists (Prasugrel or Ticagrelol) inhibit platelet
      function in less than 1 hour, which is compatible with transfer times for primary PCI.

      Ticagrelor is a direct-acting inhibitor of the platelet P2Y12 receptor with a rapid
      antiplatelet effect. It has been shown to reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events
      among patients with acute coronary syndromes, as compared with Clopidogrel, and has the
      potential to improve coronary reperfusion and the prognosis for patients with STEMI treated
      with primary PCI. but The issue of pre-treatment with ticagrelor for patients with STEMI
      remains an area of ongoing debate; whether they are initiated in the pre-hospital setting,
      emergency department, or anywhere .
