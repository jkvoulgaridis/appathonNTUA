  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Skills for Change&quot; Diabetes Nutrition Education Program was a one-year, community-based
      conducted in Ambulatory Health Care Services health centers in Al Ain. The project involved
      nutrition education to improve blood glucose control, diet and physical activity levels of
      Emirati adults with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high prevalence of diabetes and its complications in the UAE, very few diabetes
      education intervention studies have been conducted in a representative population in the
      country. The Skills for Change Program was a one-year, community-based, cluster randomized
      study involving Emirati adults with type 2 diabetes. We implemented a behavioral lifestyle
      intervention to improve glycemic control, food choices, and physical activity levels and to
      decrease sedentarity. The project was culturally adapted to Emirati adults with type 2
      diabetes and was driven by theoretical principles of behavior change and education to enhance
      intervention effectiveness.
