      10.17 GoTHAM is intended as a signal-seeking, biomarker, phase Ib/II study that will evaluate
      the safety and anti-tumour activities of the novel combination of avelumab with
      177-Lu-DOTATATE (a type of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; PRRT) or external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as avelumab which has changed
      the treatment landscape for metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma (mMCC), many mMCC patients who
      attained an initial response exhibit acquired resistance within 1 year. Therefore, novel
      treatment combinations are needed to improve patient outcome. MCC is an exquisitely
      radiosensitive tumour and there is emerging data supporting the role of radiation in inducing
      immunogenic cell death and therefore potentially improving the anti-tumour efficacy when
      combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is
      used in first-line treatment for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), by delivering radiation to
      somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expressing tumour cells. Most NETs, including MCC, express SSTR.
      Therefore, MCC tumours are ideal candidates for PRRT, and immune checkpoint inhibitor
      combination approaches with PRRT are highly attractive.

      The GoTHAM trial is intended as a signal-seeking and biomarker study. It is designed as a
      prospective, open-labelled, multi-institutional, three-arm, phase Ib/II trial that will
      evaluate the safety and anti-tumour activity of 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate (LuTate) or external
      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in combination with avelumab in patients with mMCC. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the anti-tumour activity as reflected by PFS rate at 12 months.
