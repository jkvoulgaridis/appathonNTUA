      The study is looking at the role of the mesentery in disease recurrence for ileocolic Crohn's
      disease. It is a prospective study that has been designed to perform extended mesenteric
      excision on patients undergoing their first ileocolic resection for Crohn's disease.
      Endoscopic recurrence will be monitored with the hypothesis that patients receiving extended
      mesenteric ileocolic resection will have reduced endoscopic recurrence at 6 months after
      resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for ileocolic Crohn's disease (CD) is a limited mesenteric
      resection. There is growing, but still limited, evidence that extended mesenteric excision
      during ileocolic resection is beneficial in decreasing disease recurrence. We propose a
      prospective multicenter cohort study to better understand the role of extended mesenteric
      excision in ileocolic CD and how it affects disease recurrence. The primary outcome of this
      study will be the rate of endoscopic recurrence at 6 months in patients undergoing first-time
      resection for ileocolic CD. Secondary outcomes will include endoscopic recurrence at 18
      months and rates of recurrence requiring surgery by 2 years. These outcomes will be compared
      to historical controls (limited mesenteric resection). Our hypothesis is that patients
      receiving extended mesenteric ileocolic resection will have reduced endoscopic recurrence at
      6 months after resection. As seen in previous studies, advanced mesenteric and mucosal
      disease predicts increased surgical recurrence.

    <description>Surgery can be performed either laparoscopically or open depending on surgeon preference and the circumstances of the surgery. Surgeons will perform a high ligation of the ileocolic pedicle, between the superior mesenteric artery and the bifurcation of the ileal and right colic branches, and to fully mobilize the mesentery off of the retroperitoneum prior to bowel transection and anastomosis. The entire mesentery related to the specimen will be removed.
Outcomes in the prospective arm will be compared to historical controls.</description>
