  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the safety and tolerability of the new medicine NNC0472-0147, its
      concentrations in the blood and its effect on blood sugar for the treatment of diabetes.
      Another goal of the study is to determine an effect of NNC0472-0147 on cholesterol. The first
      part of the study is conducted in healthy people, while the second part involves people with
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The study will test how NNC0472-0147 is tolerated by the body, how it
      is taken up in the blood, how long it stays there and how much blood sugar is lowered. In
      part 1, participants will either get the new medicine NNC0472-0147 or placebo (an injection
      that does not contain active medicine) - which treatment is decided by chance. In part 2,
      participants will either get the new medicine NNC0472-0147 or insulin glargine - which
      treatment is decided by chance. It is the first time that NNC0472-0147 is tested in humans.
      Participants will get once daily injections of either NNC0472-0147 or insulin glargine for a
      treatment period of fourteen days. The injections will be given under the skin
      (subcutaneously, s.c.) of the left thigh. Participants will be in the study for about 7
      weeks. There will be 15 visits with the study doctor. People cannot be in the study if the
      study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Only women who cannot become
      pregnant are allowed to participate.

          -  Use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) other than metformin or use of glucagon-like
             peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide) within
             90 days prior to the day of screening.

          -  Treatment with peptide proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
             inhibitors within 180 days prior to the day of screening.
