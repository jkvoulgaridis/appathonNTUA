  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a tDCS-accompanied intensive cognitive
      training of working memory leads to performance improvement in individuals with prodromal
      Alzheimer's disease.

      The goal of the present study is to assess behavioral (primary) effects of a multi-session
      cognitive training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Many studies
      to date have found tDCS to be an efficient method to enhance various cognitive functions by
      modulating cortical excitability in young adults, but its behavioral impact and underlying
      mechanisms in pathological aging still need to be elucidated. Individuals with prodromal
      Alzheimer's disease, will participate in a three-week cognitive training with concurrent
      online tDCS application. Cognitive performance (primary) will be examined before, during and
      after the intervention, in order to draw conclusions about the effect of tDCS. In addition to
      cognitive training, a control group, receiving sham stimulation during training, will be
      assessed. Follow-up sessions to assess long-term effects are planned four weeks and seven
      months after the post assessment. Furthermore, to assess potential predictors of tDCS
      effects, functional and structural parameters will be measured with MRI. The results of the
      study will offer valuable insights into efficacy of combined tDCS and cognitive training, as
      compared to training alone, in individuals with prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease.
      Moreover, improved understanding of tDCS effects on cognitive training performance and
      underlying neural correlates may help to develop novel approaches for modulating cognitive
      decline in healthy and pathological aging.
