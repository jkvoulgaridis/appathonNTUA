  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia is increasingly safe. Major complications of airway management are no more common
      but still the most life-threatening condition amongst anesthesia practice and even medicine.
      Thyromental height test (TMHT) is an objective measure of the height between the anterior
      borders of the mentum and thyroid cartilage, measured while the patient is lying supine with
      the mouth closed. This study was designed to assess the validity of the TMHT as a single
      objective predictor for difficult laryngoscopy and to be compared to other objective
      measures.
