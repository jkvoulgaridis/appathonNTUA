  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD),
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of tomivosertib in combination with paclitaxel in
      patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) of any subtype.

      The trial will enroll up to 45 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2 with any breast cancer (BC) subtype and at least one
      measurable lesion, for whom standard-of-care treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or
      were refused.

      All patients will be initially treated with tomivosertib for 14 days (referred as the run-in
      period). Once treatment samples are obtained, weekly paclitaxel will be added to the
      treatment regimen.

      Tumor assessments will be done at screening and then periodically throughout trial treatment.
      Patients will continue to receive trial treatment until progressive disease, as defined
      according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1,
      intolerable trial-treatment-related toxicity, consent withdrawal, or other criteria is met
      (defined within the trial protocol).

    <intervention_model_description>All patients will be initially treated with tomivosertib monotherapy for 14 ± 2 days (the run-in period). Once the on-treatment samples for pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments are obtained, weekly paclitaxel will be added to the treatment regimen.
The first 3 to 9 patients will be part of Group 1. The first 3 patients enrolled in this group will receive tomivosertib at a dose of 100 mg orally twice daily (BID) and will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of tomivosertib in combination with paclitaxel. Depending on the occurrence/absence of DLTs, this first group of 3 patients may need to be expanded (up to 9 patients) or the trial may proceed to start enrollment in Group 2. Group 2 patients will receive tomivosertib at a dose of 200 mg orally BID during the 'run-in' period, as well as weekly paclitaxel in combination with tomivosertib during the 'post run-in' period.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every serious adverse event (SAE) and related AE, following informed consent and at least until the '30-day safety follow-up' visit, will be assessed. All AEs during treatment will also be included.</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of non-serious and serious AEs. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities will be used to code all AEs to a system organ class and a preferred term. Incidence of AEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and toxicity grade. Each of these outputs will include for each AE, system organ class and preferred term as reported by the Investigator based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). Detailed listings for all adverse events will also be provided.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Pharmacodynamic Effects (PD) Following 14 Days of Tomivosertib Monotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>All enrolled patients will undergo the sampling for PD assessments during screening and after 14 days (± 2 days) of tomivosertib monotherapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The PD evaluations to be performed will include endpoints related to both direct anti-neoplastic and immunomodulatory actions of the drug. A patient will be considered to have a response if one or more of the PD endpoints (listed in the lab manual) differ between baseline and on-study. The PD response rate will be calculated as the percentage of the patients in the PD Population for whom a PD response is observed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor assessments used to determine ORR will be conducted at screening and every 8 ± 2 weeks from the enrollment date for 12 months, then every 12 ± 2 weeks, until progressive disease, consent withdrawal, or death.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a complete response or partial response according to RECIST v.1.1, based on the Investigator's assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor assessments used to determine CBR will be conducted at screening and every 8 ± 2 weeks from the enrollment date for 12 months, then every 12 ± 2 weeks, until progressive disease, consent withdrawal, or death.</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a complete response or partial response or stable disease according to RECIST v.1.1, based on the Investigator's assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic Effects (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>All patients from Group 1 and 5-8 patients from Group 2 will be considered as the PK subset. Plasma samples will be obtained at the pre-determined time points during cycle 2 - days 1 and 2. Following cycle 1, treatment cycles are 28 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentrations of tomivosertib and paclitaxel will be determined using validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry assays. Plasma concentrations will be summarized by scheduled time point with descriptive statistics, which will include the n, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (%), median, minimum, and maximum.</description>

             Note: psychological, social, familial, or geographical factors that might preclude
             adequate trial participation should be considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current evidence of incomplete recovery from clinically-significant toxicities
             associated with prior anti-cancer treatment(s), that would represent a
             contra-indication to experimental therapy in the opinion of the Investigator.

             enrollment and/or major surgery within 2 weeks prior to enrollment.

          3. Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring ≥10 mg/day of prednisolone (or its
             equivalent). Patients with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they
             have completed their treatment, have recovered from the acute effects of radiation
             therapy or surgery prior to the start of tomivosertib, fulfill the steroid requirement

             electrocardiogram abnormality; unstable angina; New York Heart Association Class 3 or
             4 congestive heart failure; uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure ≥100
             mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg); or history of congenital prolonged QT
             syndrome.

          7. Prior therapy with any inhibitor of MNK1 and/or MNK2.

             to the start of tomivosertib or expected requirement for use of a strong CYP3A4
             inhibitor or inducer during trial treatment.

          9. Need for proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers at enrollment.

             currently in complete remission for ≥2 years.

         12. History or current evidence of any other medical or psychiatric condition or addictive
             disorder, or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will
             increase the risks associated with trial participation, or require treatments that
             will interfere with the conduct of the trial or the interpretation of trial results.

         13. Pregnant or breast-feeding (lactating) women or women who plan to become pregnant or
             breast-feed during her trial participation.
