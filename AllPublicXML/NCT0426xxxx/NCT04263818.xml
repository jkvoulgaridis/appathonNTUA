      The increasing development of interventional digestive endoscopy raises the challenge to
      teach and learn complex endoscopic procedures. Nowadays experts are facing the challenge of
      explaining precisely an elaborate choreography of movements performed during the procedure,
      while novices are confronted with a broad range of hand, wrist and shoulder movements each
      resulting in different endoscope responses. The teaching strategy of endoscopy could benefit
      from a dedicated motion library that would associate the endoscopist's motion and the
      consequent endoscope response. A simplified endoscopic language made of individual motions
      could greatly shorten the learning curve.

      The aim of the study is to record and analyze endoscopist and endoscope motions to identify
      key movements during colonoscopy.

    <description>Carrying out the endoscopic procedure planned for the patient with the dedicated colonoscope which has magnetic coils over the entire length of the insertion tube. These magnetic coils generate a pulsed magnetic field at low frequency. These pulses are transmitted to an external receiver, refreshed at 15 images per second, then relayed to the processor to generate a 3D representation of the colonoscope next to it of the endoscopic image. There is no additional risk to the patient compared to current practice.
