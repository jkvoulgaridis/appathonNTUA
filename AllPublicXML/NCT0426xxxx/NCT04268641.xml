  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the interest of using wheelchair positioning
      equipment on the decrease of postural disorders, compared to the standard use of a wheelchair
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stroke is the main cause of hemiplegia in developed countries. Fifteen percent of people
      who say they have a stroke need, at home, a wheelchair to get from one room to another. The
      use of a wheelchair can cause postural disorders which can lead to pain, orthopedic deformity
      and pressure ulcers.

      This study aims to assess the interest of using wheelchair positioning equipment (Seat back,
      Positioning cushion and Belt) on the decrease of postural disorders.

      This decrease will be assessed after a standardized course, performed under three different
      conditions: with the positioning equipment (Positioning cushion and Seat back), with the
      positioning equipment and the belt and with the wheelchair alone.

      Clinical tool used to assess the decrease is the Seated Postural Control Measure for Adults
      2.0 (SPCMA 2.0).

      This study, which will be the first prospective, interventional, multicenter, controlled and
      randomized study, could pave the way for guidelines of good practice, for wheelchair
      positioning of hemiplegic patients in France

    <description>The Primary Outcome Measure is the variation of the Degree of pelvic posterior tilt at the end of the three standardized course. These courses were performed with Standard Wheelchair, Standard Wheelchair + Seat back + Positioning cushion + Belt or with Standard Wheelchair + Seat back + Positioning cushion.
The Degree of pelvic posterior tilt was measured using the SPCMA 2.0 score (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe retroversion)</description>
