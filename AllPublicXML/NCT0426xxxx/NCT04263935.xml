      This trial is a prospective non-interventional observational study. The Chinese patients with
      lymphoma were included and the study data on driver gene abnormalities, demographic
      characteristics, clinicopathological characteristics and treatment were collected to evaluate
      the relevance of efficacy and disease prognosis.
