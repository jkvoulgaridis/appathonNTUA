      This study evaluates the use of NanoDoce injected directly into tumors in the kidney of
      people with renal cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NanoDoce is very small (submicron) particles of the chemotherapy drug, docetaxel, which is
      administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are
      injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less
      systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, the submicron
      particle docetaxel will be injected directly into tumors in the kidney of people with renal
      cell carcinoma that is localized to (has not spread beyond) the kidney. All subjects in this
      study will receive NanoDoce and will be evaluated to see if NanoDoce is safe.

    <intervention_name>NanoDoce (sterile nanoparticulate docetaxel) Powder for Suspension</intervention_name>
    <description>NanoDoce is manufactured using a Precipitation with Compressed Antisolvent (PCA) technique that employs supercritical carbon dioxide and acetone to generate docetaxel nanoparticles within a well-characterized particle-size distribution. Prior to administration, the NanoDoce powder in vial is suspended with a sterile solution of Polysorbate 80 (0.0075% - 0.0375% (w/w))/Ethanol (0.06% - 0.3% (w/w)) in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for injection.</description>
