  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotion regulation has been identified as an important transdiagnostic factor in the
      treatment of mental health disorders. This study aims to examine, for the first time,
      REMOTION, a novel blended therapy intervention aimed at reducing symptom severity and
      improving emotion regulation of patients in an outpatient psychotherapy setting. REMOTION is
      an internet based intervention that is administered as an add-on to psychotherapy. This study
      aims to investigate feasibility and also potential effectiveness of REMOTION in an outpatient
      setting. Participants will be randomly assigned to the study conditions. Outcomes are
      assessed at baseline, after six weeks and after twelve weeks.

    <description>REMOTION is an internet-based intervention aimed at transdiagnostically reducing symptom severity and improving emotion regulation of psychotherapy patients. The structure of REMOTION is based on the idea of an extended process model of emotion regulation as postulated by J.J. Gross (2015). The program includes the following modules: introduction, psychoeducation, identification, selection, implementation and modification. A variety of elements based on different psychotherapy approaches (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Emotion Focused Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy etc.) are integrated in the program. Participants should work through one module per week. REMOTION is administered as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU), which is psychotherapy at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy at the University of Bern.</description>

    <description>Treatment as usual (TAU) refers to psychotherapy at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy at the University of Bern. Psychotherapy at the outpatient clinic is based on Psychological Therapy (Grawe, 1998) principles, which are largely rooted in academic psychology and which mainly draw on interventions from Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Individual case conceptualization are key in Psychological Therapy, along with general therapeutic factors and a focus on the therapeutic relationship.</description>
