    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic management of recurrent inguinal hernia in children has been recently introduced
      in surgical practice. One of the most important advantages of using the laparoscopic approach
      in cases with recurrent inguinal hernia (RIH) is that it avoids the previous operation site
      thus avoiding injuries to the vas and vessels [19]. Some authors designed a study to compare
      laparoscopic hernia repairs with classical open repairs for pediatric RIH following the Ô¨Årst
      open repair. They stated that avoiding the scarred tissue the former operation area with the
      laparoscopic approach facilitates the procedure and decreases both the operative time and
      complication rate. [5]. Further, it is as simple as a fresh hernia repair because the time
      taken for the repair of recurrent hernia laparoscopically was the same as the fresh
      laparoscopic repair with no added complication [5,20]. In laparoscopic surgery, approaching
      the hernia defect from within the abdomen, makes the area of interest bloodless, and the
      magnification renders anatomy very clear, making surgery precise [6,7].

      Abstract: Background: Open repair of recurrent inguinal hernias [RIH] in infancy and
      childhood is difficult and there is definite risk of damaging the vas deferens and testicular
      vessels. Laparoscopic repair of RIH has the benefit of avoiding the previous operative site.
      The aim of this study is to present the investigator's experience with laparoscopic repair of
      RIH either after open or laparoscopic hernia repair with stress on technical refinements to
      prevent recurrence. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective study of laparoscopic
      repair of recurrent inguinal hernia. Records of patients that have been subjected to
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair for RIH were reviewed and evaluated. All patients were
      subjected to laparoscopic repair of 42 recurrent hernial defects. The primary outcome
      measurements of this study include; operative time. The secondary outcomes include; hydrocele
      formation, iatrogenic ascent of the testis and testicular atrophy.
