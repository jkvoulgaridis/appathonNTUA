  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study a radioactive tracer, a type of imaging drug that is
      injected into the body to see how it is taken up in sites of active infection using an
      imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT).

    <description>[18F]Fluoropropyl-Trimethoprim, also known as [18F]F-TMP, is a radiolabeled imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET/CT).The use most relevant to this protocol is for imaging bacterial infection in human subjects. The parent compound, trimethoprim (TMP) is a well-known, safe, broad-spectrum, synthetic, small molecule antibiotic that has been used clinically for over 50 years for the treatment of acute bacterial infection and has been combined with sulfa-based antibiotics (Bactrim/Septra) for bacterial infection prophylaxis especially in the lung and bladder. An immediate clinical use for TMP radiotracers is imaging of pathologic bacteria that are the cause of human infection.</description>
