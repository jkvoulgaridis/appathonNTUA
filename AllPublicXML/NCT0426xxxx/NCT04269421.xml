      The SURGERY of arthrosis of the subtalar joint, carried out between 9 and 12 years of age,
      the aim is to restore and maintain the physiological alignment between the talus and the
      calcaneus during bone maturation.

      There are few articles in the literature that talk about the return to sport of pediatric
      patients after surgery. The aim of the study is to review patients operated on remotely kick
      heel and describe how they return in their sports (resilience, type of activities carried
      out, recovery times). The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and functional
      results of patients of age Pediatric treated in the investigator's SC Orthopedics Pediatric
      Traumatology department for flat feet with &quot;calcaneostop&quot; surgery. The study aims to describe
      the method of resuming sports activities, analyzing the timing and difficulties declared by
      patients after surgery, with the help of specific questionnaires.
