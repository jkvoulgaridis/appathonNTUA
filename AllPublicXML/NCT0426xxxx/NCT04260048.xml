  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BEAM is a multi-site longitudinal cohort study of hypothalamic gliosis, central regulation of
      appetite and weight gain in children. Participants will be recruited from the community in
      the greater Seattle and greater Baltimore area. All participants will consent to enroll in
      the 24-month study during which they will complete 5 in-person study visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed 2-site research study uses a longitudinal cohort design in 102 children aged
      9-11 yr. It will include for all participants baseline MRI and functional MRI, in-depth
      eating behavior testing, and measurement of hormone profiles. Serial measurement of weight
      and self-reported eating habits will occur over 2 yr, with a repeated MRI at 2 yr. The study
      aims to: 1) test if MBH gliosis is associated with impaired intake regulation and poor weight
      outcomes over 2 yr in children, 2) determine if CNS appetitive processing is negatively
      affected when evidence of MBH gliosis is present, and 3) test for other brain regions in
      which gliosis is present in association with excess adiposity in children. An exploratory aim
      will assess changes in gliosis in children over 2 yr and their relation to changes in body
      weight and adiposity.
