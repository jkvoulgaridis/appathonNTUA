  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre prospective cohort study will monitor the efficacy and safety of Autologous Fat
      Transfer (AFT) with pre-expansion. AFT will be evaluated in terms of quality of life,
      aesthetic result, complications, oncological safety and cost-effectiveness. It follows the
      BREAST trial, the randomised controlled trial comparing AFT with implant-based
      reconstruction. In this study, patients all receive AFT.

    <measure>Aesthetic result</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The overall aesthetic result will be measured using 3D-photographs which will be assessed by a panel of independent plastisch surgeons, ex-breast cancer patients and healthy volunteers. In addition, the volume, shape and symmetry will be assessed by the patient using the BREAST-Q questionnaire (satisfaction with breasts subdivisions).</description>

    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of short-term als well as mid-term complications associated with procedures as well as (serious) adverse events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oncological safety</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Oncological follow-up will comply to the guidelines for breast cancer and will take place by a yearly consult with the oncological surgeon (including physical examination and mammography/ultrasound/MRI) for 5 years postoperatively. All (loco)regional and distant recurrences will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the intramural and socio-economic costs associated with the breast reconstruction treatment.</description>
