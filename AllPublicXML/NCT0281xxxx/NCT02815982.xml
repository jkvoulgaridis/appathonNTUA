  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of and optimal time post
      cancer treatment to offer caregivers a new health behavior change intervention (NOURISH-T),
      as well as assess its preliminary efficacy on specific child health behaviors. The study will
      also explore whether caregivers NOURISH-T exhibit more improvements than caregivers in EUC
      (standard care).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40% of off-treatment pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) are overweight or obese,
      which increases their risk for negative long-term physical health complications. Consistent
      with the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) emphasis on patients transitioning from treatment to
      cancer survivorship and increasing long-term healthy behaviors in these survivors, we
      conducted a pilot RCT to address the increasing overweight/obesity rates among PCS by
      targeting their caregivers as agents for PCS behavior change. We focused on parents'
      behaviors, attitudes and roles in promoting healthier eating and physical activity (PA) in
      PCS and adapted an evidence-informed, manualized parent intervention - NOURISH - found to be
      effective for parents of overweight and obese children and adolescents in reducing child and
      adolescent BMI. We adapted NOURISH for caregivers of 5 - 13 year old PCS (6 months -4 years
      off active cancer treatment). Our pilot feasibility RCT - NOURISH-T (Nourishing Our
      Understanding of Role modeling to Improve Support for Healthy Transitions) evaluates: 1) the
      preliminary feasibility efficacy of NOURISH-T for PCS, compared with an Enhanced Usual Care
      (EUC) control condition, and 2) factors to consider to improve future adaptations of the
      intervention. The project enrolled caregivers of PCS at two pediatric oncology clinics into
      the 6-week intervention (or EUC) with assessments of both caregivers and PCS occurring pre-
      and post-6 weeks of intervention, and at a 4-month follow-up. In comparison to EUC, we
      hypothesized that caregivers and PCS assigned to the NOURISH-T condition would show greater
      improvements in dietary intake, physical activity, and in anthropometric health indicators
      over time.

    <measure>Satisfaction and Exit Survey Composite Scale Score -- ONLY CAREGIVERS COMPLETED THIS MEASURE</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the final session (6-sessions), caregivers completed a likert-type survey assessing what they liked/disliked about the intervention, as well as what was/was not useful or helpful in reaching health goals. Eleven items were summed to obtain a total continuous composite satisfaction/liking score. Each item was measured on a likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (=1) to strongly agree (=5). The scale sum score ranged from 11 to 55 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with the intervention. More specifically, the higher the score, the more useful the caregiver thought the intervention and the more they liked participating in the intervention. Lower scores indicate that the caregiver thought the program was not useful and they did not like participating.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention, Post-Intervention (6-weeks), Follow-up (4 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>A 24-hour recall was completed by caregivers using the Automated Self-administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall-2011 (adult version) at pre-intervention, post-intervention (6-weeks) and at 4 months follow-up. The outcome was measured as the number of calories consumed over 1-day. Caregivers reported detailed information on the foods consumed and quantity including the method used for preparation, portion sizes, and where the food was purchased using visual cues in the previous day through the ASA24 website (https://asa24.nci.nih.gov/). The website reported the total number of calories consumed based on the data input.</description>

    <description>This 8-item questionnaire was completed by the pediatric cancer survivor and assessed child intake of sugar sweetened beverages, breakfast and dinner habits, as well as frequency of fast food intake. The sum score represents the total number of sugary beverages consumed and the number of times consuming fast food in the prior week. Higher scores indicate greater consumption of sugary beverages and fast food in the prior week. The sum score could range from 0 and has no upper limit.</description>

    <description>The intervention aims to increase caregivers' self-efficacy for behavioral change, and facilitate an authoritarian approach to parenting. Behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring, contingency management, and stimulus control are integrated in these sessions. Further, because participatory experiences enhance overall intervention efficacy, these activities are incorporated throughout, including self-assessments, discussions and experiential activities. Homework is assigned between sessions so skills can be practiced. We also focus on the caregivers' relationship with everyone in the family, not just the &quot;identified patient&quot; or overweight child.</description>

        <title>Satisfaction and Exit Survey Composite Scale Score -- ONLY CAREGIVERS COMPLETED THIS MEASURE</title>
        <description>At the end of the final session (6-sessions), caregivers completed a likert-type survey assessing what they liked/disliked about the intervention, as well as what was/was not useful or helpful in reaching health goals. Eleven items were summed to obtain a total continuous composite satisfaction/liking score. Each item was measured on a likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (=1) to strongly agree (=5). The scale sum score ranged from 11 to 55 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with the intervention. More specifically, the higher the score, the more useful the caregiver thought the intervention and the more they liked participating in the intervention. Lower scores indicate that the caregiver thought the program was not useful and they did not like participating.</description>

            <description>The intervention aims to increase caregivers’ self-efficacy for behavioral change, and facilitate an authoritarian approach to parenting. Behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring, contingency management, and stimulus control are integrated in these sessions. Further, because participatory experiences enhance overall intervention efficacy, these activities are incorporated throughout, including self-assessments, discussions and experiential activities. Homework is assigned between sessions so skills can be practiced. We also focus on the caregivers’ relationship with everyone in the family, not just the “identified patient” or overweight child. PCS are assessed, but do not directly participate in the intervention.

            <description>Caregivers randomized to the enhanced usual care will attend assessment sessions and an initial session moderated by an independent interventionist. The session will address the role of diet and exercise in pediatric overweight. In addition, EUC caregivers will receive nationally available print or web-based brochures on pediatric overweight on 2 occasions during the study so that similar (but not as intensive) information is provided in the intervention and EUC arms of the study. Caregivers also receive a booster phone call 2 months after the end of the intervention period. PCS are assessed, but do not directly participate in the intervention.

        <description>A 24-hour recall was completed by caregivers using the Automated Self-administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall-2011 (adult version) at pre-intervention, post-intervention (6-weeks) and at 4 months follow-up. The outcome was measured as the number of calories consumed over 1-day. Caregivers reported detailed information on the foods consumed and quantity including the method used for preparation, portion sizes, and where the food was purchased using visual cues in the previous day through the ASA24 website (https://asa24.nci.nih.gov/). The website reported the total number of calories consumed based on the data input.</description>

          <title>Automated Self-administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall (ASA 24) -- CAREGIVERS ONLY MEASURE</title>
          <description>A 24-hour recall was completed by caregivers using the Automated Self-administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall-2011 (adult version) at pre-intervention, post-intervention (6-weeks) and at 4 months follow-up. The outcome was measured as the number of calories consumed over 1-day. Caregivers reported detailed information on the foods consumed and quantity including the method used for preparation, portion sizes, and where the food was purchased using visual cues in the previous day through the ASA24 website (https://asa24.nci.nih.gov/). The website reported the total number of calories consumed based on the data input.</description>

        <description>PCS and caregivers were trained to wear a piezoelectric, computer downloadable pedometer consecutively for 7 days prior to the pre- and post- intervention and 4 months post-intervention assessments to assess frequency of daily steps.

            <description>The intervention aims to increase caregivers’ self-efficacy for behavioral change, and facilitate an authoritarian approach to parenting. Behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring, contingency management, and stimulus control are integrated in these sessions. Further, because participatory experiences enhance overall intervention efficacy, these activities are incorporated throughout, including self-assessments, discussions and experiential activities. Homework will be assigned between sessions so skills can be practiced. We also focus on the caregivers’ relationship with everyone in the family, not just the “identified patient” or overweight child.

The session will address the role of diet and exercise in pediatric overweight. In addition, EUC caregivers will receive nationally available print or web-based brochures on pediatric overweight on 2 occasions during the study so that similar (but not as intensive) information is provided in the intervention and EUC arms of the study. Participants will also receive a booster phone call 2 months after the end of the intervention period.
