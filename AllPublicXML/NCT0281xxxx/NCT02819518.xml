  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts.

      In Part 1, the safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with one of three different
      chemotherapies will be assessed in the treatment of locally recurrent inoperable or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has not been previously treated with
      chemotherapy.

      In Part 2, the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy will be assessed
      compared to the safety and efficacy of placebo plus chemotherapy in the treatment of locally
      recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC, which has not been previously treated with
      chemotherapy.

      The primary hypotheses are that:

        1. the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs Progression-Free Survival
           (PFS) compared to placebo and chemotherapy in:

             -  all participants,

             -  participants with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score
                (CPS) ≥1 tumors, and

             -  participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors, and

        2. the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs Overall Survival (OS)
           compared to placebo and chemotherapy in:

             -  all participants,

             -  participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 tumors, and

             -  participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors.

             cancer not previously treated with chemotherapy.

          -  Has centrally confirmed TNBC, as defined by the most recent American Society of
             Clinical Oncology/college of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines.

          -  Has completed treatment for Stage I-III breast cancer, if indicated, and ≥6 months
             elapsed between the completion of treatment with curative intent (e.g., date of
             primary breast tumor surgery or date of last adjuvant chemotherapy administration,
             whichever occurred last) and first documented local or distant disease recurrence.

          -  Has been treated with (neo)adjuvant anthracycline, if they received systemic treatment
             in the (neo)adjuvant setting, unless anthracycline was contraindicated or not

             treating physician.

          -  Has measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version
             1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as determined by local radiology review.

          -  Has provided recently or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy from a locally
             recurrent inoperable or metastatic tumor lesion for central determination of TNBC
             status and PD-L1 expression, unless contraindicated due to site inaccessibility and/or
             participant safety concerns.

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, as
             assessed within 10 days prior to the start of study drug.
