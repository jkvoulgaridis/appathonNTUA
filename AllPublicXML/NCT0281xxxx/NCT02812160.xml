      Device Name: Spatz3 Adjustable Balloon System® (Spatz3) Clinical Phase: Pivotal Trial Design:
      Multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial Trial Participants: Adults, ages 22-65,
      with a BMI ≥ 30 and &lt; 40 who have failed to achieve and maintain weight-loss with a weight
      control program Control group: Supervised diet and exercise Planned sample size: 282 subjects
      randomized 2:1 to device/control Follow-up duration: 8 months for control and 14 months for
      treatment Primary endpoints: Percent change in total body weight (%TBL) at 32 weeks AND
      Clinical response, where a responder is defined as a subject with at least a 5% loss in total
      body weight at 32 weeks Secondary endpoints: Maintenance of 40% of the weight loss with the
      balloon six months after the balloon is removed Clinical response, where a responder is
      defined as a subject with at least a 25% loss in excess body weight at 32 weeks

             the procedure

          4. History of obesity (BMI ≥ 30) for at least 2 years

          5. History of failure with non-surgical weight loss methods

          6. Willingness to follow protocol requirements, including signed informed consent,
             routine follow-up schedule, completing laboratory tests, completing diet counseling

          7. Residing within a reasonable distance from the investigator's office and able to
             travel to the investigator to complete all routine follow- up visits

          8. Ability to give informed consent

          9. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., not post-menopausal or surgically sterilized)
             must agree to use adequate birth control methods. Acceptable birth control methods are
             limited to hormonal contraceptives (oral, flexible vaginal ring, skin patch,
             injection), diaphragms, IUDs, condoms with or without spermicide, and voluntary
             abstinence. The method of birth control must be documented and verified at follow-up.
             Should a treatment arm subject become pregnant during the implantation period, the
             balloon will be extracted during the second trimester - the timing of which will be
             determined via consultation with the subject's obstetrician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior gastrointestinal surgery with sequelae, i.e. obstruction, and/or adhesive
             peritonitis or known abdominal adhesions.

          2. Prior open or laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

          3. Prior surgery of any kind on the esophagus, stomach or any type of hiatal hernia
             surgery.

          4. Any inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract including esophagitis,
             Barrett's esophagus, gastric ulceration, duodenal ulceration, cancer or specific
             inflammation such as Crohn's disease.

          5. Potential upper gastrointestinal bleeding conditions such as esophageal or gastric
             varices, congenital or acquired intestinal telangiectasis, or other congenital
             anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract such as atresias or stenoses.

          6. A gastric mass.

          7. A hiatal hernia &gt; 2cm or severe or intractable gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms.

          8. Acid reflux symptoms to any degree that require more than one medication for symptom
             control.

          9. A structural abnormality in the esophagus or pharynx such as a stricture or
             diverticulum that could impede passage of the balloon alongside the endoscope.

         10. Achalasia or any other severe esophageal motility disorder that may pose a safety risk
             during the removal of the device

         11. Severe coagulopathy.

         12. Insulin-dependent diabetes (either Type 1 or Type 2) or a significant likelihood of
             requiring insulin treatment in the following 12 months.

         13. Subjects with any serious health condition unrelated to their weight that would
             increase the risk of endoscopy

         14. Chronic abdominal pain

         15. Motility disorders of the GI tract such as gross esophageal motility disorders,
             gastroparesis or intractable constipation

         16. Hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis

         17. Serious or uncontrolled psychiatric illness or disorder that could compromise patient
             understanding of or compliance with follow up visits and removal of the device after 8
             months.

         18. Alcoholism or drug addiction.

         19. Patients unwilling to participate in an established medically-supervised diet and
             behavior modification program, with routine medical follow-up.

         20. Patients receiving daily prescribed treatment with aspirin, anti-inflammatory agents,
             anticoagulants or other gastric irritants.

         21. Patients who are unable or unwilling to take prescribed proton pump inhibitor
             medication for the duration of the device implant.

         22. Patients who are known to have, or suspected to have, an allergic reaction to
             materials contained in the system.

         29. Subjects who are taking diet pills
