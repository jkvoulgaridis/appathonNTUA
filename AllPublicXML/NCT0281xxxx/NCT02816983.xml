    <textblock>
      Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with rising prostatic specific antigen (PSA)
      are eligible for this study. 11C-Choline PET/CT will be used to identify metastatic lesions.
      Patients with &lt;=3 metastatic lesions will receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as
      definitive treatment. Blood draws will be taken to monitor the development of anti-prostate
      cancer immunity

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be receiving standard of care SBRT as outlined in the Universal Content
             Management (UCM) Procedure Manual
             (http://mayocontent.mayo.edu/radoncology/categories/index.html)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer patients with ≤ 3 lesions identified
             on standard imaging and/or choline PET/CT within 60 days of registration

          -  Castrate levels of testosterone

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) ≤ 2 (Appendix I).

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Emergent cord compression for spinal metastases

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               1. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last 6 months prior to registration

               2. Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to registration

               3. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration

               4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days prior to
                  registration

               5. Severe hepatic disease, defined as a diagnosis of Child-Pugh Class B or C hepatic

               6. HIV positive with Cluster Differentiation 4 (CD4) count &lt; 200 cells/microliter.
                  Note that patients who are HIV positive are eligible, provided they are under
                  treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and have a CD4 count
                  ≥ 200 cells/microliter within 30 days prior to registration. Note also that HIV
                  testing is not required for eligibility for this protocol.
