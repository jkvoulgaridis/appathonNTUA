  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess and confirm the adequate immunogenicity and safety profile of the
      Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-Hep B-IPV-PRP-T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine administered
      in HIV-exposed uninfected infants and in HIV-exposed infected infants.

      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the 3-dose primary
           series in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

        -  To describe the persistence of all antibodies before receipt of the booster dose in
           HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the booster dose in
           HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To describe the safety profile after each and all doses of the study vaccine
           administered as a 3-dose infant primary series in HIV-exposed infected and in
           HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

        -  To describe the safety profile of the study vaccine administered as a booster in
           HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female infants born from HIV-infected mothers will be tested for HIV infection from
      birth to 6 weeks of age. HIV infected and HIV uninfected participants will be enrolled into
      two groups at Day 0. Some infants detected HIV-exposed infected outside of the hospital
      center facilities and the trial screening procedure may also be enrolled. All participants
      will receive primary vaccinations with Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine at
      6, 10 and 14 weeks of age and a booster dose at approximately 15 to 18 months of age will
      receive a booster dose of the Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine.
