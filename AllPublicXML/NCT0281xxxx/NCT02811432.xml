  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct an individually randomised, controlled, superiority trial with two parallel
      groups; an intervention arm allocated to receive KMC and a control arm receiving 'standard'
      care. The primary aim is to examine the impact of KMC initiated before stabilisation on
      mortality within 7 days relative to standard care amongst neonates ≤2000g at four hospitals
      in Uganda. We hypothesise that neonates in the arm allocated to receive KMC before
      stabilisation will have a 25% overall reduction in mortality within 7 days compared to
      neonates allocated to receive standard care.
