  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEPPER is a randomized study comparing the three most commonly used anticoagulants in North
      America in patients who have elected to undergo primary or revision hip or knee joint
      replacement surgery. The anticoagulants being compared are enteric coated aspirin, low
      intensity warfarin, and rivaroxaban.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PEPPER is a large pragmatic clinical trial to inform patient choice and balance risk
      tolerances of individuals who face decisions about different drugs and strategies for deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) prevention after total hip (THA) and knee
      (TKA) replacement. Indeed, clinical equipoise exists to ethically support such a randomized
      trial that has great potential to change current practice. We have selected the three
      prophylaxis methods that represent current orthopaedic practice in North America and
      collectively account for more than 80% of all hip and knee replacements; a) enteric coated
      aspirin (regimen with lowest bleeding risk; clinical PE and all-cause mortality rates
      comparable to more intensive anticoagulants), b) low intensity (INR Target 2.0) warfarin
      (time honored and one of the most common North American regimens; low bleeding risk [1-2%]),
      and c) rivaroxaban, a new oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor (regimen with lowest PE and DVT
      rate but higher bleeding risk [3-5%]). Prophylaxis will continue for 30 days, in accordance
      with clinical guidelines, and pneumatic compression will be utilized in hospital in
      conjunction with each treatment group. Each regimen is commonly used in contemporary
      practice, supported by observational and clinical trial data, and endorsed by the American
      College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)
      guidelines

    <measure>Aggregate primary clinical endpoints of all-cause mortality plus PE and DVT</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months of operation</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the frequency of the aggregate primary clinical endpoints of important venous thromboembolism (clinical PE and DVT leading to hospital readmission) and all-cause mortality (aggregate indicator of fatal events, including both PE and major hemorrhage related to anticoagulant use) among three different venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis regimens. An audit of all hospital readmissions within 6 months of operation will be accomplished by routine postoperative follow-up through a mechanism of central telephone surveillance of patient-reported outcome events that is augmented by on-site research coordinator follow-up and validation of suspected endpoint events and adverse outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 6 months of operation</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the groups with respect to patient-reported outcomes in order to assess their impact on specific function of the replaced joint. Validated functional outcome tools will be compared among patients with and without primary endpoint events, as well as with historical baseline data warehoused in the FORCE registry, a national Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded joint replacement outcomes database. Study site overlap with the FORCE registry is planned.</description>

    <description>Analysis of the contribution of &quot;standard of care&quot; methods of anesthesia on clinical effectiveness of three different prophylaxis regimens. Stratification and subgroup analysis between patients with general compared with regional neuraxial (spinal/epidural) anesthesia will assess contribution of anesthesia to efficacy of VTE prophylaxis.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 6 months of operation</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of the the relative frequency of thromboembolic events and bleeding complications in total hip compared with knee replacement patients. Evidence suggests etiology of venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) differs between THA and TKA and each may warrant a distinctive prophylaxis regimen based on likely outcomes.</description>

    <description>Enteric coated aspirin (162 mg po) will be administered on the day of operation, prior to surgery, with a sip of water. Thereafter, starting on postoperative day #1, all patients in the aspirin group will receive 81 mg po bid to complete the treatment period of 30 days. Patients on preoperative cardiac dose aspirin may continue their usual dosing regimen prior to the morning of surgery, and then commence the PEPPER trial aspirin dose of 81 mg po bid on the day after operation.</description>

    <description>Warfarin will be administered starting on the day of operation, prior to surgery, with a sip of water. The initial dose will be empirically determined by body weight: less than 125 lbs (56.7 kg) - 2.5 mg; 125-250 lbs (56.7-113.4 kg) - 5 mg; greater than 250 lbs (113.4 kg) - 7.5mg. The initial dose will be repeated on the evening of surgery if the preoperative dose was administered prior to noon on the day of operation; no warfarin will be given on the evening of surgery if the preoperative dose was received after noon on the day of operation. Thereafter, starting on postoperative day #1, warfarin will be given each evening based on INR values to achieve a target of 2.0 (range 1.7-2.2).</description>

    <ipd_description>The participating institutions will follow NIH guidelines concerning the sharing of research data. As outlined by the NIH and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the participating institutions will make available to the public the results of this collaboration and any accompanying data that were supported by PCORI. There are no specimens or biological resources for sharing as a result of this planned project.
In the course of this research project, we anticipate generating ranges of estimated complications and adverse events as they relate to the use of VTE prophylaxis in the context of hip and knee replacement. Access to these data and associated recommendations generated under the project will be available for educational, research and non-profit purposes. Such access will be provided using web-based applications, as appropriate and consistent with the data distribution policies of the Medical University of South Carolina and the University of Maryland.</ipd_description>
