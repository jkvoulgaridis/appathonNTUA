      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of FCX-007, evaluate C7 expression and
      the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007 and to analyze wound healing as a
      result of FCX-007 administration in subjects with RDEB.

    <textblock>
      RDEB is a congenital and progressive orphan skin disease caused by the deficiency of the
      protein type VII collagen (COL7). The objective of this study is evaluate the safety FCX-007
      intradermal injections in RDEB subjects. Additionally, the trial will evaluate type VII
      collagen expression, the presence of anchoring fibrils resulting from FCX-007, as well
      evidence of wound healing.

      Approximately twelve subjects are expected to enroll in the Phase I/II trial. Phase I will
      enroll approximately six adult subjects. Phase II will enroll approximately six pediatric
      subjects (ages 7 or older). All subjects will receive FCX-007 to one or more paired target
      RDEB wounds. Proof of mechanism will be monitored through digital photography of target
      wounds and assays conducted on biopsies taken from target wounds.

    <measure>Safety as measured by frequency of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects with product-related adverse events will be monitored throughout the study during onsite visits as well as in adverse event diaries. Adverse events will be grouped into pre-treatment adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events and will be tabulated by preferred terminology and by body system for each study phase. The number of adverse event entries, as well as the number of patients will be reported. Analyses will include tabulation of adverse event type, relationship to FCX-007, seriousness, and severity of adverse events according to CTCAE
This will include testing for:
Presence of replicative competent lentivirus
Monitoring for immune reaction by C7 autoantibody analysis in blood by Indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot
Physical exams (including vital signs, skin exams, and wound cultures as needed)
Severity of toxicity measured by NCI Common Criteria grades</description>

    <description>In Phase I, a target of three adult subjects will be enrolled into Group A and a target of three adult subjects will be enrolled into Group B.
In Phase II the study will target enrolling subjects (aged seven (7) or older) to each arm, but will allow a disproportionate distribution of subjects between Group A and Group B to equal approximately 6 total subjects.
All subjects will receive FCX-007 into intact skin as well as to one or more paired target wounds at least one time during the study with a possible second administration pending laboratory results.
One wound in each target wound pair will be used as control for efficacy and safety evaluations. FCX-007 administered wounds will be compared within paired target wounds to untreated wounds.</description>
