    <textblock>
      Evidence shows the positive effects of Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes in younger
      individuals. The proposed study investigates the usefulness of these classes in older
      Veterans aged 50-85. We hope to show that such classes can lead to improvements in both
      thinking skills as well as stress levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expansion of the aging Veteran population, in addition to the frequent presence of
      comorbidities (e.g., PTSD and TBI) that exacerbate age-associated cognitive and health
      declines, has generated substantial interest in interventions that promote brain health in
      older Veterans. A growing body of evidence shows the positive effects of Brain Health &amp;
      Wellness classes on brain health in younger and middle-aged adults, thus training might be
      able to enhance brain health in older Veterans and offset age-related declines. Such training
      holds particular promise in enhancing areas of cognition that are especially susceptible to
      aging processes (e.g. attention and executive control), potentially through multiple
      mechanistic pathways. It is in many respects a cognitive exercise and may strengthen neural
      networks involved in such processes. Additionally, there is evidence for further facilitating
      brain health in other ways related to, for instance, altering the stress response. Currently,
      there is little information regarding the potential brain health benefits in older adults. As
      a first step to understanding these potential beneficial effects in Veterans, the aim of the
      proposed pilot study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of
      two Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes in healthy older Veterans through a randomized,
      controlled trial.

    <time_frame>Baseline (within two weeks pre-intervention) and Outcome at 2 months (within 2 weeks post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale were collected within 2 weeks before the intervention and again within 2 weeks after the intervention. This outcome measure represents the change in score in Geriatric Depression Scale: pre-intervention score minus post-intervention score. The maximum Geriatric Depression Scale score is 30, and the minimum score is 0. Higher scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale indicate more depressive symptoms, so worse outcome. However, since we are analyzing a change in the Geriatric Depression Scale score of pre- minus post-intervention, a larger change score for a particular arm indicates a greater degree of improvement.</description>

    <description>Participants' scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were collected within 2 weeks before the intervention and again within 2 weeks after the intervention. This outcome measure represents the change in score in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory: pre-intervention score minus post-intervention score. The maximum STAI score is 80, and the minimum score is 20. Higher scores on the STAI indicate more anxiety symptoms, so worse outcome. However, since we are analyzing a change in the STAI score of pre- minus post-intervention, a larger change score for a particular arm indicates a greater degree of improvement.</description>

    <description>Participants' scores on the Repeatable Battery for Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) were collected within 2 weeks before the intervention and again within 2 weeks after the intervention. The maximum total scaled score is 160, and the minimum score is 40, where higher scores are better. This outcome measure represents the change in total scaled score on the RBANS: post-intervention score minus pre-intervention score.

          <title>Mindfulness</title>
          <description>Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR): The MBSR group meets once per week for 2½ hours, with a day-long retreat in the 6th week of the 8-week program. Participants are instructed in mindfulness practice in the form of sitting meditation, body awareness, yoga, mindful movement, and informal mindfulness practices of daily life (e.g., eating, communicating, working, coping). The day-long retreat includes a review of class material, more lengthy meditation and yoga practice, as well as a group lunch. Between classes, patients enhance their participation by practicing at home with meditation CDs, homework assignments, and readings from the course materials and manual. Home practice is tracked with pre-made log sheets on which participants record the number of hours engaged in practice at home.</description>

          <title>Brain Health</title>
          <description>Brain Health education class:
The Brain Health class is matched for the same number of hours, instructor, schedule (including day-long retreat), homework, and home practice as that of the MBSR class. The class provides background and education about brain-behavior relationships and discusses how brain injuries can disrupt various aspects of cognition, such as memory and attention. There are also units on nutrition and sleep, including strategies for successful aging. To control for the yoga/movement portion of the MBSR class, the Brain Health class also includes simple chair exercises, such as stretching and reaching. The day-long retreat includes review of class topics, video documentaries on these topics, and a group lunch. The Brain Health class matches MBSR intervention for critical process elements such as clinician interaction, social interaction with the group, movement, schedule, and homework activities, without the inclusion of a meditative/mindfulness component.</description>

        <title>Geriatric Depression Scale Change Score</title>
        <description>Participants' scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale were collected within 2 weeks before the intervention and again within 2 weeks after the intervention. This outcome measure represents the change in score in Geriatric Depression Scale: pre-intervention score minus post-intervention score. The maximum Geriatric Depression Scale score is 30, and the minimum score is 0. Higher scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale indicate more depressive symptoms, so worse outcome. However, since we are analyzing a change in the Geriatric Depression Scale score of pre- minus post-intervention, a larger change score for a particular arm indicates a greater degree of improvement.</description>
