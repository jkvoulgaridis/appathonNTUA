  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pragmatic cluster randomized trial that is being conducted in 5 countries,
      with sites in 4 cities in Canada, Benin, Ghana, Indonesia and Vietnam. The unit of
      randomization is the health facility (24 health facilities randomized). The trial tests a
      complex intervention-a two phase programmatic public health package which includes a
      standardized public health evaluation and analysis, to identify problems and barriers
      limiting Latent Tuberculosis Infection diagnosis and treatment among close contacts of active
      Tuberculosis cases. This will be followed by implementation of appropriate solutions and
      strengthening of the LTBI clinical program. The primary objective will be to estimate the
      increase the number of household contacts initiating LTBI treatment per newly diagnosed index
      patient, within 3 months of diagnosis of the index patient. A secondary objective is to
      evaluate the cost effectiveness of this two phase intervention. If successful, this approach
      can be expanded throughout these countries. After initial preparations, including
      administrative and ethical review, all participating sites will be randomized to intervention
      or control. Immediately after this, Phase 1 will begin in intervention sites with the
      standardized public health evaluation to identify barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment
      initiation and the selection of solutions to be used in Phase 2. To ensure standardization of
      data gathering research staff will use (i) current indicators of the Latent Tuberculosis
      Infection cascade of care in intervention facilities (number of contacts per index case
      registered, investigated, started on treatment and completing treatment) and (ii) interviewer
      administered questionnaires for patients with active pulmonary Tuberculosis, adult and child
      household contacts and clinic staff. These questionnaires will assess latent
      Tuberculosis-related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs from the perspective of these different
      participants. Results from intervention sites in Phase 1 will be analyzed, and used by the
      investigators, together with local public health officials, to decide on appropriate
      corrective solutions in each sites. Contact Investigation registries will also be developed
      with research staff from sites. In Phase 2, solutions for problems identified will be
      selected and implemented at the intervention sites, Contact Investigation registries will be
      implemented and clinical training will be provided to strengthen LTBI health care worker
      knowledge and clinical programs. Study outcomes and costs will be measured at all
      intervention and control sites throughout Phase 1 &amp; 2. The main study will run for 18 months.
      Upon completion of the main study, a 1 year cross over study will be conducted where control
      sites will receive a streamlined version of the intervention and original intervention sites
      will be used to evaluate the sustainability of the intervention. Results will be disseminated
      within each country through existing links with National Tuberculosis Programs, and through
      international organizations such as the World Health Organization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome will be the change in the number of household contacts (HHC) initiating treatment per newly diagnosed TB index patient within 3- 4 months from index patient diagnosis, between Phase 1 and Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary outcome will be recorded at all health facilities for the full duration of phase 1 (6 months) and for the last 6 months of phase 2.</time_frame>
    <description>A new TB index patient will be microbiologically confirmed using AFB smear, culture, and/or molecular tests such as Xpert®MTB/RIF, depending on local protocols. A HHC will be defined as someone who slept in the same house at least one night per week, or spent more than one hour in the house at least five days per week, on average, over the preceding 3 months. The house will be defined as the dwelling, or buildings, which the family unit occupies and uses regularly. In each of the 6 month periods, the total number of index patients, the number of their contacts who were recorded in clinic documents, and the number of these HHC who initiate LTBI therapy will be collected in both the control and intervention arms. For TB index patients diagnosed towards the end of each 6-month period in most sites we will allow up to 3 or 4 additional months for the HHC to be started on LTBI treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the trial, costs related to the implementation of the LTBI program evaluation and strengthening will be measured in each setting, using time and activity logs for research staff, investigators, health care workers and management staff involved in implementation. Country specific budgets will be used to obtain expenditures related to services, supplies and materials. To estimate LTBI related health system personnel costs, time and motion studies will be conducted at the start of phase 1 and the end of phase 2.</description>

    <description>Latent Tuberculosis Infection program evaluation &amp; diagnosis: In intervention health facilities the current Latent Tuberculosis Infection program will be evaluated and gaps in the Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade of care will be identified. Gaps in the current cascade will be quantified and solution proposed that are unique to the problems identified in each site. In phase 2 of the study low cost solutions will be implemented and the Latent Tuberculosis Infection program scaled up and improved. Study outcomes are evaluated in the first and last 6 months of trial. Costing evaluations are done throughout the trial.</description>
