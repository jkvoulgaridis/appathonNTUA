      Coronary stents are the default devices for the treatment of coronary artery disease in
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) according to existing guidelines. However,
      thrombosis and restenosis are still the main limitations of current permanent metallic
      stents. In contrast to Bare Metal Stents (BMSs), Drug Eluting Stents (DESs) have a reduced
      restenosis rate due to the presence of antiproliferative agents in the coating layer of the
      stent surface and reduced rate of repeat revascularisation. However, late and very late stent
      thrombosis remains the limitation of DES in spite of prolonged dual antiplatelet
      therapy.Bioabsorbable scaffolds have been introduced to overcome limitations of permanent
      metallic stents.

      The aim of this observational registry is to investigate the clinical performance and
      long-term safety of Magmaris in a real world setting.
