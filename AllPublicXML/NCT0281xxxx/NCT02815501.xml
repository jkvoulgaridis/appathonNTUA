  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstetric complications are common and can be responsible for maternal and foetal morbidity
      and mortality. Thyroid dysfunction has been identified as a possible cause of obstetric
      complications.

      Many studies have been conducted to estimate the prevalence and define the nature of
      obstetric complications observed in patients with thyroid dysfunction. However, women with
      obstetric complications are not systematically screened for thyroid dysfunction and no
      published study has evaluated the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in women with an
      obstetric complication. As no consensus has been reached concerning systematic screening for
      thyroid dysfunction in pregnant women, the identification of new high-risk populations could
      possibly result in a change of clinical practice.
