      The purpose of the study is to investigate the use of topical tofacitinib to promote hair
      regrowth in patients with alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, and alopecia universalis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label clinical trial. We plan to treat 10 adults with AA (with at least
      2 patches of alopecia involving the scalp), AT or AU with tofacitinib ointment for a maximum
      of 6 months. During treatment, patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks and effectiveness of
      the medication will be measured by changes in hair growth. Laboratory evaluation will be
      performed before and during treatment in order to monitor for adverse effects of the
      medication.
