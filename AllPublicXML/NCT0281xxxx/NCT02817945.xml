  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluate the efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD in
      lung cancer patients and neuroendocrine neoplam patients. A single dose of 111-185
      Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-3P-TATE-RGD will be injected intravenously. Visual and
      semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of somatostatin receptors may be greatly up-regulated in the cells of a variety of
      tumor including carcinoids, gastrinomas, paragangliomas, small cell lung cancer and non-small
      cell lung cancer. Octreotide is an eight amino acid cyclic peptide that preserves a four
      amino acid motif (Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr) that is critical for the biological activity of
      somatostatin (SSTR). On the other hand, the RGD moiety binds with integrin αvβ3, also plays
      an important role in the regulation of tumor growth, angiogenesis, local invasiveness, and
      metastatic potential in human tumor. To target both receptors, a heterodimeric peptide
      TATE-RGD was synthesized from TATE and RGD through a glutamate linker and then labeled with
      68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and
      dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NOTA-3PTATE-RGD PET/CT
      in evaluation of lung cancer and neuroendocrine neoplams.
