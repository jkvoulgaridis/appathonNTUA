  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial objective is to demonstrate the safety of idarucizumab, as assessed by the
      occurence of patients with drug related adverse events (including immune reactions) and
      all-cause mortality in paediatric venous thromboembolism patients treated with dabigatran in
      ongoing clinical trials who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures or patients who have
      life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding which requires urgent intervention, when rapid
      reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed.

Reversal of the dabigatran effect at time t was defined as the 100 percent (%) *(pre-dose coagulation time - post-dose coagulation time at time t)/(pre-dose coagulation test - upper limit of normal).
Values equal to or higher than 100% were interpreted as reversal. Central blood sampling for dTT, ECT were to occur immediately prior to administration of each vial of Idarucizumab and post-dose at 30min, 4h, 12h and 24h.</description>

      <recruitment_details>An open-label, uncontrolled case series trial, with a single treatment arm of idarucizumab in patients with venous thromboembolism treated with dabigatran etexilate in ongoing Boehringer Ingelheim pediatric clinical trials (1160.106 and 1160.108). Treatment period was around 1 day followed by 29 days of safety follow-up period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility to participants in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that they met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be assigned to treatment groups if any one of the specific entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

Two equal injection parts were administered no more than 15 min apart. The time between start of injection of the first vial and end of the second vial was 22 min followed by 24 hours post-dose observation period.</description>

            <description>2.5 gram (g) per 50 milliliter (mL) vial of Idarucizuma was administrated via intravenous injection (vial 1) with (in order of preference): a 5 minutes (min) infusion with an infusion pump, a 10 to 15 min drip, or intravenous push with a syringe followed by another injection (vial 2) of same dosage of Idarucizumab for participants who were treated with dabigatran and had uncontrolled or life threatening bleeding that required urgent medical or surgical intervention or who required emergency surgery/urgent procedures where adequate haemostasis was required (total dosage: up to 5g based on the weight of participant). Two equal injection parts were administered no more than 15 min apart. The time between start of injection of the first vial and end of the second vial was 22 min followed by 24 hours post-dose observation period.</description>
