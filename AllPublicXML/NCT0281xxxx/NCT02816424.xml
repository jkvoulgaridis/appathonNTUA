  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine
      recommend that teen health providers screen for sexual risk behaviors and provide education
      and counseling to those at risk, there are currently no specific guidelines or protocols
      available to guide such practices, nor have there been any rigorous evaluations of efficacy.
      Preventing teen pregnancy through brief intervention in primary care holds the promise to
      have a significant public health impact and reduce health disparities by engaging, educating,
      and motivating the majority of teens who visit a primary care setting each year. In the
      current study, we seek to rigorously evaluate the impact of brief intervention vs.
      informational control on unprotected sexual intercourse among teens with past year
      unprotected sex at two primary care clinics serving predominately underserved, minority
      populations in New Mexico. The target population for the current study will be 1350 male and
      female teens, aged 13-19, from the Atrisco Center for Family and Community Health and the
      Albuquerque Job Corps Wellness Center. Extensive formative work involving the study
      population will be conducted prior to the trial to refine the motivational interviewing-based
      brief intervention. Eligible youth will be randomly assigned to brief intervention or an
      informational control condition, in addition to regularly offered medically-based
      contraception consultation and prescription services. Follow-ups at 3- and 9- months will
      compare rates of unprotected sex and acceptance of long-acting reversible contraceptives.
      Brief education and counseling interventions could be feasibly implemented during the greater
      than eight preventive and acute primary care visits that the average US adolescent attends
      during their teen years. Such an approach could conserve valuable resources required by more
      intensive interventions for nonresponsive teens with greater need. Furthermore, social
      determinants of health, such as poverty and race, that may reduce access to more extensive
      psychosocial interventions, are less likely to prevent access to primary care, increasing
      health equity.

    <description>Principles and skills of motivational interviewing will be used with participants assigned to brief intervention. These participants will receive feedback that they are at risk for unintended pregnancy. They will receive information on the likelihood of pregnancy given their self-reported frequency of unprotected sex. They will be given information regarding negative consequences associated with teen pregnancy. They will be provided with information on the chances of pregnancy with abstinence, condom use, oral contraceptives, and Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC). Following information exchange, participants who are high in readiness to change will engage in action planning, whereby a specific plan for reducing risk for unintended pregnancy will be collaboratively developed with the interventionist. Patients who are low in readiness to change will complete a motivational interviewing-based roadmap activity that is designed to strategically evoke motivational speech.</description>
