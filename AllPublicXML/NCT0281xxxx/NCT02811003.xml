      To evaluate bioinduction of new tissue and tendon healing after implantation of the Rotation
      Medical Bioinductive Implant used as adjunct to surgical repair in the treatment of
      insertional Achilles tendonitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm study conducted under a common protocol
      designed to evaluate long-term outcomes following open treatment and implantation of the
      Rotation Medical Bioinductive Implant to treat insertional Achilles tendinopathy.

      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled and treated with the Rotation Medical Bioinductive
      Implant.

      Enrollment is anticipated to take up to 12 months and all subjects will be followed for two
      years after surgery. Therefore, the overall study duration is estimated to be 36 months.
