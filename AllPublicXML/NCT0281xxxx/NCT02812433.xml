  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in neonatal care, birth asphyxia in term newborns remains a serious
      condition causing significant mortality and long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy and
      mental retardation. Currently, no treatment exists to repair brain injuries secondary to
      neonatal asphyxia. The only available treatment for this condition is hypothermia that may
      prevent but not repair the development of brain injury. The success of this therapy is
      limited.

      Sildenafil already is used with some newborns for other purposes (i.e., persistent pulmonary
      hypertension), but, surprisingly, its effect on the newborn brain has never been studied
      systematically. The findings of the investigators in the rat model of term neonatal
      encephalopathy demonstrated that the administration of sildenafil following asphyxia promotes
      brain injury recovery. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that sildenafil may improve
      neurodevelopmental outcome in term asphyxiated newborns, in whom hypothermia treatment has
      failed to prevent the development of brain injury.

      Before being able to run a large multicenter randomized trial to prove this hypothesis, the
      investigators need to run a phase Ib pilot trial to ensure the feasibility and safety of
      using sildenafil in this population of newborns. Thus, for this phase Ib study, the
      investigators hypothesize that sildenafil can be safely used with term asphyxiated newborns
      treated with hypothermia. The investigators will test this hypothesis with the following
      specific aims:

        1. Safety (primary): ensure that sildenafil can be safely used in asphyxiated newborns
           treated with hypothermia;

        2. Tolerability (secondary): study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sildenafil
           in these newborns;

        3. Efficacy (exploratory): determine whether sildenafil improves neurodevelopment at 2
           years of age, decreases brain injury on day 30 of life and decreases neuroinflammation.
