      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab in treating
      patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk urothelial cancer that cannot be treated with
      cisplatin-based therapy before surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with
      muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer who are ineligible for neoadjuvant
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses (e.g. peripheral blood cluster of
      differentiation [CD] 4+inducible T-cell co-stimulator [ICOS]+ T cells) to durvalumab and
      tremelimumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer who are ineligible
      for neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.

      II. To evaluate pathologic T0 rate after neoadjuvant treatment with durvalumab and
      tremelimumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer comparing to
      historical data (about 10% in patients with high-risk disease).

      III. To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on
      day 1 of weeks 1 and 4. Beginning 4-6 weeks after the last infusion, patients undergo
      cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days, and then every 3
      months for up 1 year.
