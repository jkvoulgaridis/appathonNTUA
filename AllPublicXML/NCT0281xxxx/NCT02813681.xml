  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, women who have chronic back pain after pregnancy have attributed the cause to
      the epidural procedure. While many studies have shown no greater incidence of generalized
      post-partum back pain in those who received an epidural, no studies have measured localized
      pressure sensitivity at the epidural insertion site. Short-term pressure sensitivity might
      limit patient's mobility and activities in the post-partum period. Understanding the factors
      that increase insertion site pressure sensitivity will allow the investigators to modify
      epidural placement technique in order to minimize this effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have examined how epidural placement changes localized sensation at the epidural
      insertion site. This study will be the first study to quantitatively measure sensation at the
      epidural insertion site. The investigator will assess localized pressure sensitivity with an
      algometer. An algometer is a hand-held device commonly used by neurologist to detect sensory
      deficits and measures the pressure sensitivity threshold in a 1-cm diameter circular area.
      Ultrasound (US) pre-procedural examination provides more accurate landmarks for the placement
      of epidural catheters. The investigator will determine if an US examination prior to epidural
      placement reduces localized pressure sensitivity. The investigator will also determine if
      there are correlations between the participants characteristics and/or comorbidities and
      increased pressure sensitivity at the insertion site.
