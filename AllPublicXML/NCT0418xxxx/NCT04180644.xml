  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate new methods for the collection, storage, shipment, and RNA
      extraction of skin tape specimens from children with atopic dermatitis (AD) that will
      facilitate the multi-center SunBeam Birth Cohort study. Additionally, this pilot study will
      test new methods for the generation of whole transcriptome sequencing data from skin tape RNA
      and whether these data reflect the transcriptional state of the skin in health and disease.

    <description>Skin tape strips will be collected from lesional and non-lesional skin. Adhesive skin sampling discs will be firmly pressed against the skin in a hairless location (not the face) followed by lifting it free of the skin. These discs will then be used to evaluate proteins and lipids in the upper layers of skin.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide informed consent/assent.

          2. Male or female, 4-12 years of age (prepuberty) inclusive at the time of consenting

          3. Participant must be either:

               1. Active atopic dermatitis with two areas of non-lesional AD within 5 cm of the
                  measured lesional area within the same region.

                  OR

               2. .No personal history or current manifestations of AD, food allergy, asthma,
                  allergic rhinitis, and no positive prick or blood testing for allergen (based on
                  self-report); and no evidence of dry skin or other skin condition

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide consent or comply with the protocol

          2. Presence of any skin condition that might compromise the stratum corneum barrier in
             infants and young children (e.g., ichthyosis, psoriasis, extensive seborrheic
             dermatitis, scabies)

          3. History of any skin reaction to tape, or adhesives

          4. Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory
             testing that are not listed above, which in the opinion of the investigator, may pose
             additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's
             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or
             interpretation of the data obtained from the study.

          5. Use of any topical product (e.g., emollient, topical corticosteroids, topical
             immunomodulatory agents, topical antibiotics) on the area(s) to be tested within 24
             hours before the study visit.
