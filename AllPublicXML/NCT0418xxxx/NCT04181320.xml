  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is designed as an open label, randomized, prospective, assessor blinded,
      multi centre investigation.

      254 evaluable subjects will be randomized to either standard of care group or standard of
      care with Granulox added as an adjunct therapy in predominantly venous leg ulcer subjects.
      Standard of care wound management will be completed, including wound cleansing, debridement
      if necessary and application of a suitable dressing and compression system until complete
      wound closure.

      The study will be divided into two phases. Firstly, a two week run-in period to ensure
      compliance to compression therapy followed by a 20 weeks treatment period starting with
      randomization and allocation of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to verify previous clinical findings and to pinpoint clinically
      relevant efficacy, associated to intended use of Granulox® as a therapy added to a defined
      standard of care in the management of chronic VLUs. The most relevant outcome is considered
      to be an increase in healing of chronic VLUs over a period of 20 weeks.

      This is a multi-centre European open label randomised 2-arm parallel group study. The study
      will include multiple European counties (e.g. France, Germany, UK, Poland, Croatia and Czech
      Republic), with approximately 2-7 clinics per country.

      The study will run with a two-phase set-up, with a 14 days run-in period and a an up to 20
      weeks treatment period starting with randomization and allocation of treatment. Confirmation
      of wound closure is further assessed after a 15 day followup period.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare wound healing between management of chronic
      VLUs with or without added Granulox®. The main efficacy criterion is Confirmed Complete wound
      Closure (CCC).

      Secondary objectives include comparisons of management of chronic VLUs with or without added
      Granulox® with regards to:

        -  Wound healing by means of Possible Complete wound Closure (PCC), Wound Area Regression
           (WAR), time to healing, trajectories, pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH) score, and
           clinical assessment.

        -  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL)/quality of
           life (QoL), pain and pain intensity, and impression of change.

        -  Acceptability of and compliance to therapy.

        -  Cost-effectiveness.

        -  Safety by means of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) reporting.
