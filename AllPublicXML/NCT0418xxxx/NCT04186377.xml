      A randomized, controlled open-label, parallel group study to examine the effectiveness of a

      non-infected diabetic foot ulcers.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled open-label, parallel group study of 12 weeks duration aimed
      to examine the effectiveness of a local application of the kalahari melon (Citrullus lanatus)
      seed oil (S26E) for the healing of non-infected chronic (&gt;12 weeks) diabetic foot ulcers. The
      S26E is a natural extract rich in unsaturated (such as linoleic, oleic, palmitic and static)
      fatty acids which have shown promise in the promotion of wound healing by modulating the
      migration and functional properties of inflammatory cells in wound cites as well as the
      production of inflammatory cytokines. The safety of topical S26E application on human skin
      has been clinically demonstrated.

      Eligible participants will be adults patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1 or 2 and
      chronic (persistent for &gt;12 weeks after initial presentation) neuropathic or neuroischaemic
      non-infected diabetic foot ulcers. Following recruitment and randomization (on a 1:1 ratio)
      eligible patients will attend the study site on weekly intervals. After a run-in period of 2
      weeks (visits 1-2) during which all participants will receive the optimal standard-of-care
      for neuropathic/neuroischaemic diabetic ulcers (incl. optimization of glycemic control,
      off-loading, local debridement as needed, atraumatic surface scrubbing, saline washing and
      sterile dressing) eligibility will be reassessed. Participants who will continue in the study
      will receive standard of care (control group) or standard of care plus daily local S26E
      application on ulcer (intervention group) (visits 3-12). After visit 12 the application of
      S26E will be terminated and all participants will receive an additional follow up visit 4
      weeks later (final visit). Efficacy end-points will be assessed at the end of the of 12 weeks
      of observation (Visit 12)
