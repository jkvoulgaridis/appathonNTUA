  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate whether sensory flicker can modulate neural activity of deep brain
      regions in humans, and whether it can have relevant effects on behavior. Moreover, it will
      compare those effects to the gold-standard method of modulating brain circuits, direct
      electrical stimulation of the brain (the same mechanism as deep brain stimulation), using a
      powerful within-subjects design.

    <textblock>
      Clinical trials have explored the modulation of brain circuits to treat several brain
      disorders, including Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), depression, and
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). However, current means to non-invasively modulate brain
      activity are limited.

    <measure>Effect of sensory flicker exposure on local field potential (LFP): comparing mean power spectral density at the frequency of flicker being presented and nearby frequencies</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Power spectral density of the LFP will be measured across stimulus frequencies and modalities of sensory flicker stimuli in auditory areas, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Comparisons will be drawn between the mean power spectral density measured in dB/Hz at the frequency of flicker being presented, and nearby frequencies (+/- 20Hz).</description>

    <measure>Percent correct responses following audiovisual flicker exposure of given frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo a behavioral task in which they are exposed to one of two audiovisual flicker conditions. Percent correct responses following audiovisual flicker exposure will be compared between the two conditions.</description>

    <description>Patients will be exposed to Sensory Flicker Stimulation.
In one experiment, patients will be exposed, for about 10 minutes at a time, to a sequence of sensory flicker trials each lasting a few seconds. Each trial may include the following modalities and frequencies of flicker:
Modalities: auditory only, visual only, or audiovisual combined.
Frequencies: random, or anywhere from 5Hz to 100Hz.
In another experiment, patients will undergo a behavioral task in which they will be exposed to one of 2 flicker conditions on separate days.</description>

    <description>Patients will be exposed to direct electrical brain stimulation with low-amplitude current, at given flicker frequencies. Patients will be exposed to frequencies ranging from 5-100Hz, for up to 10 seconds at a time. Initially, frequencies of 5.5Hz and 40Hz will be tested.
During brain stimulation sessions, bipolar electrical stimulation will be applied to one or more areas of the brain at a time either with or without associated behavioral task. Stimulation in the absence of any behavioral task will be applied in order to assess the subject's neurophysiological response to stimulation and to identify the optimal stimulation parameters for use during behavioral task. Stimulation during behavioral task will be applied in an attempt to affect the subject's behavior.</description>
