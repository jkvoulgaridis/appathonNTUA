  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The response rate of traditional first-line chemotherapy for recurrent or persistent advanced
      cervical cancer was low. This single arm, open, phase II trial would recruit 37 eligible
      patients. A combination of cisplatin, paclitaxel and apatinib would be given for first 23
      patients. If at least 13 patients achieved complete or partial remission, the same regimen
      would be given for rest patients. The primary end is overall response rate (ORR). The second
      ends include progression-free survival, overall survival, disease control rate, remission
      duration, and adverse events. A molecular testing, mainly consisting of genomic analysis,
      will be carried in the oncologic tissues.

    <description>A combination of cisplatin, paclitaxel and apatinib would be given for all patients:
Cisplatin: 50 mg/m2 body surface area, on the first day, every 3 weeks. If the creatinine clearance rate was less than 40 ml/min, the cisplatin would be replace by carboplatin (area under ther curve = 5)
Paclitaxel: 50 mg/m2 body surface area, on the first day, every 3 weeks
Apatinib: 250 mg every day The total courses of cisplatin and paclitaxel would be no more than 6.</description>
