  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized combined basket- and umbrella trial divided
      in two parts; a limited feasibility-oriented part 1 including 154 patients and 4 treatment
      cohorts and part 2 that will include an expanded cohort of patients and treatment cohorts.
      The overall aims of the study are to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      comprehensive genomic profiling on fresh tumor biopsies as a basis for treatment decision
      making and to compare two different sequencing, bioinformatics and decision-making platforms
      (part 1). Also to evaluate the efficacy and safety of off-label treatment with cancer drugs
      in patients selected based on genomic biomarker matching.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult (age &gt;18 years)

          2. Patients with histologically-proven, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor (part
             1; hematological malignancies also eligible in part 2) progressive while on last line
             established therapy considered available for the patient. For re-recruitment (part 2)
             patients must be progressive while on trial defined treatment or off-protocol
             treatment.

          3. Fresh tumor sampling by biopsy must be possible, except for patients with CNS
             malignancy who can be included based on molecular analysis of archived tumor material.

          4. ECOG performance status 0-2.

          5. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

               2. Hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L

               3. Platelets &gt; 75 x 10^9/L

               4. Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN

               5. ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN in patients
                  with known hepatic metastases)

               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50
                  mL/min/1.73 m2

          6. Patients must have objectively measurable disease (by physical or radiographic
             examination).

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          8. For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral
             medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.

          9. Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential (premenopausal or &lt;12
             months of amenorrhea post-menopause and who have not undergone surgical
             sterilization). Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective method of
             contraception, i.e. combined hormonal contraception, or progestogen-only hormonal
             contraception, or intrauterine device, or intrauterine hormone-releasing system, or
             bilateral tubal occlusion, or vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence for the
             duration of participation in the study, and four months following completion of study
             therapy.

         10. Selected tumor types might have disease-specific inclusion criteria, defined by
             disease-specific study appendix.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing treatment-related toxicity &gt; grade 2.

          2. Patients receiving any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic, radiation, or
             hormonal other than for replacement) except for medications that are prescribed for
             supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol
             acetate, bisphosphonates, somatostatin analogues and prednisone, or equivalent, &gt;5
             mg/d). These medications must have been started ≥ 1 week prior to the screening visit
             on this study. Radiotherapy to non-target lesions is allowed.

          3. Patients pregnant or nursing.

          4. Patients of childbearing potential and sexually active and not willing to use highly
             effective contraceptive.

          5. Patients with known active progressive CNS metastases. Patients with previously
             treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that the patient has not experienced a
             seizure or had a clinically significant change in neurological status within the 3
             months prior to inclusion. All patients with previously treated CNS metastases must be
             stable for at least 1 month after completion of treatment and off steroid treatment
             prior to inclusion.

          6. Some concomitant diseases qualified for exclusion as detailed in main protocol.

          7. Other serious underlying medical conditions, which, in the Investigator's judgment,
             could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial.
