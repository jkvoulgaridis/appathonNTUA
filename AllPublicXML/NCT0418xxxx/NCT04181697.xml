  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to describe physical activity (PA) levels in young people with haemophilia A
      in Norway compared with non-haemophilia controls, and to identify factors influencing PA.
      This will be conducted through an observational study measuring PA over 12 weeks. Forty young
      people with moderate and severe haemophilia A will be enrolled. PA data will be compared to
      demographically and seasonally matched non-haemophilia controls. PA will be measured using
      the activity tracker Fitbit Charge 3. A subgroup of participants will also wear the hip-worn
      accelerometer ActiGraph GTX+BT for seven consecutive days in order to validate the two
      devices against each other.

    <description>EuroQol 5Domains 3Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using a three-level scale, and evaluate their overall health status using a Visual analogue scale (VAS) where the bottom rate (0) corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and the highest rate (100) corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS 2.1) The Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) is a validated outcome tool developed for the assessment of joint health in people with hemophilia. The ordinal joint score assesses 9 items in 6 index joints (elbows, knees and ankles). It assesses swelling, duration of swelling, muscle atrophy, crepitus of motion, range of motion (extension and flexion loss), joint pain, strength, and gait. The summation of the 9 HJHS items in 6 index joints provides users with a relative indicator of joint health, with a lower HJHS representing superior joint health.</description>

    <measure>Ultrasound joint score</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection using Ultrasound (HEAD-US) The ultrasound protocal evaluates the six joints most typically affected in PwH: the elbows, knees, and ankles, in one single examination, providing information about synovium, cartilage, and subchondral bone. Scores for each joint can range between 0 and 8, with higher scores indicating more severe abnormalities.</description>
