  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental hypothesis of this randomized controlled study was to demonstrate that early
      drain removal in patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expander
      is a safety procedure to improving clinical outcomes and quality of life (QoL). The mechanism
      of action underlying the proposed approach was intuitive. The early drain removal allows to:
      1) avoid continuous seroma development caused by active suction of drain (stopping the circle
      &quot;drain itself may perpetuate the drainage&quot; with vacuum mechanism); 2) reduce the risks
      connected to &quot;foreign body reaction&quot; as tissue inflammation and infection; 3) improve QoL
      reducing pain, length of hospital stay and limitations of daily activities.

    <description>Investigators remove the drains when the suction drain flow was less than 30 ml/day for at least 2 days or at discharge, with no further signs of infection, fluid collection or impaired wound healing (&quot;complicated&quot;, see below). Ultimately, we removed drains 3 weeks postoperatively (21 days post op) even if the flow was higher than 30 ml/day. However, leakage or severe patient discomfort led to immediate drain removal at any time during postoperative care.</description>
