  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the acute effects of different duration and intensity
      of static stretching exercises on the viscoelastic properties of the hamstring muscle and the
      knee proprioception.

      Traditionally stretching exercises have been used by health professionals as a means of
      preventing injuries by increasing performance and increasing joint flexibility. Kubo et al.
      suggest that the potential mechanism of decreased risk of injury with increased flexibility
      is a change in the viscoelastic properties of the muscle-tendon unit. Muscle fibers and
      tendons contain proprioceptors. These receptors provide information about joint angle, muscle
      length and muscle tension. There are two stretch-related proprioceptors that transmit
      information to the central nervous system about muscle tension. These receptors are muscle
      spindles (respond to changes in the length) and golgi tendon organs (respond to changes in
      the tension). For this reason, interactions between muscle tension, muscle-tendon unit,
      viscoelasticity and proprioceptive tissue (muscle spindles and golgi tendon organ); it
      becomes important when you think about how stretching exercises affect proprioception,
      flexibility and increase or decrease of joint range of motion. In the literature, four
      stretching parameters have been defined as important to influence the potential for
      increasing or decreasing the flexibility of a joint: intensity, duration, frequency and
      stretching position. The focus of this study we plan on is the intensity and duration of
      stretching.

      Exercise warming exercises before sportive activity and cooling exercises afterwards are
      widely suggested and applied. Determining the relationship between stretch severity and
      duration and viscoelastic properties and proprioception will contribute to the effective
      creation of training programs.

    <description>Muscle viscoelastic properties was assessed with Myoton® PRO device. It is an evidence-based device that evaluates the bio-mechanical properties of soft biological tissues in a non-invasive, objective, reliable, inexpensive, quick and easy manner. Myoton® PRO is used in studies to evaluate superficial skeletal muscles, connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments, and other soft tissues. It is a highly reliable method for assessing the tone, stiffness, elasticity of muscles.</description>

    <description>Proprioception was assessed with MarVAJED (Marmara Visual Auditory Joint Education Device). MarVAJED is a system for evaluating joint range of motion, analyzing joint position sense, offering biofeedback support to increase joint control, as well as directing it to controlled exercises. Analyzes joint movement with the help of small sensors. Transfers the obtained data to mobile phone, tablet or personal computer.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline static stretching exercise intensity at the beginning of each exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale of 100 mm was used to assess the intensity of stretching exercise perceived by the participant at the beginning of each repetition. The visual analog scale is used to visually measure the intensity of the detected mechanical stimulus. 0 means &quot;no stretch&quot; and 100 means &quot;maximum tolerable stretch without pain&quot;. Perceived violence from left to right increases.</description>
