    <textblock>
      Is Behavioural Activation feasible, acceptable and potentially effective for mothers
      experiencing post natal depression in Blackpool?

      Phase 1: A series of single case studies which aim to examine and refine a) the
      appropriateness of the programme to women in Blackpool b) the suitability of BA as part of a
      stepped-care approach to perinatal mental health within the Health Visitor pathway and c) the
      delivery of the programme in practice.

      Phase 2: A preliminary single group study examining the quantitative outcomes for
      participating women (i.e. symptoms of depression, anxiety and general mood, parental stress,
      responsiveness, and behavioural avoidance and activation.
