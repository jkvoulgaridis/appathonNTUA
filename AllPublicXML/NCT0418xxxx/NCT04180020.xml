    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test a new model of care (ID/LAB) in which opioid use disorder (OUD) is
      managed by infectious disease (ID) specialists and hospitalists concurrent with management of
      the OUD-related infections, using long-acting injectable buprenorphine (LAB), followed by
      referral as soon as possible after hospital discharge to community resources for long term
      treatment of OUD.

    <textblock>
      There are three specific aims that this study will use to assess a new model of care aimed at
      treating opioid use disorder (OUD). These aims address whether treatment is maintained by
      patients, if patients' opioid use outcomes improve and to determine if adherence to treatment
      for infectious disease results in fewer re-hospitalizations and emergency room visits, as
      well as improved quality of life.

      The specific aims:

      Aim1: The primary outcome will be a binary indicator of whether a patient is enrolled in and
      receiving effective medication treatment for OUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or injection
      naltrexone) at 12 weeks (3 months) after randomization.

      Aim 2: Evidence of improved opioid use outcomes (lower days of using opioids, negative urine
      opioids).

      Aim 3: Have higher rates of completion of the antimicrobial regimen for their infectious
      disease, decreased re-hospitalizations and emergency room presentations related to either
      their infectious disease or OUD over the 12-week follow-up period, and improved measures of
      quality of life.

      The intent of this study is to test the hypothesis:

      Assignment to the ID/LAB arm (OUD managed directly by the infectious disease (ID) specialists
      or hospitalist team with long acting injection buprenorphine (LAB)) will promote greater
      enrollment in effective medication treatment for OUD at 12 weeks after randomization,
      compared to TAU.

    <measure>Retention in Medication Treatment for OUD</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Enrollment in effective medication treatment for OUD (either buprenorphine maintenance, methadone maintenance, or extended-release naltrexone) will be ascertained through interview of the participant at each assessment point, using a modified, brief version of the Treatment Services Review that records type and dose of medication treatment, contact information on the treatment program, and psychosocial treatment modalities accessed since the previous visit (e.g. professional counseling, 12-step group participation).
The primary outcome will be a binary indicator of whether or not the patient is enrolled on buprenorphine maintenance treatment or other effective medication (methadone maintenance or extended-release naltrexone) at 12 weeks after randomization, verified by either report from the treatment program, or if the treatment program does not respond, prescription drug monitoring report or EMR.</description>

    <description>This outcome is assessed by the Medical/Infectious Disease/TAU questionnaire. This form documents the completion of antimicrobial therapy and re-hospitalization for infection. The initial evaluation documents the relevant infection and medical details such as infection site, organism, and stage. It also extracts the type of ant-infective, route of administration, dose, and planned duration. Information on follow-up is collected alteration of treatment plan, infection related adverse events (e.g. PICC complications, drug reaction/toxicity to anti-infective agent prescribed by non-study clinicians, etc), and intervening hospitalizations. Completion success is defined as appropriate completion of antimicrobial therapy, as documented in the initial assessment, without interruption or unexpected prolongation of therapy.</description>

    <description>TAU is designed to systematize what is the current practice at the participating hospitals and in most U.S. hospitals while offering a minimum standard of care. TAU will constitute recommendation for MOUD initiation and consultation for addiction medicine when available; in practice, it is typically detoxification from opioids and referral to community-based addiction treatment after hospital discharge.</description>
