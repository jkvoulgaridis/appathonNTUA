    <textblock>
      This trial is an experimental, randomized, double blind, prospective intervention study

      Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in this trial, divided into 2 arms, as follow:

      For adult (18-40 years old)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study age group/arm will be divided into two groups of treatment. One group will receive
      investigational product and one other group will receive active comparator. This Study is
      sequential age de-escalation. To be conducted in heathy adults (18-40 years old) and followed
      by children (10-17 years old) ). Before the study started, the subjects will be assessed for
      anti HBs Antibody. For subjects with anti-HBs not protective (&lt; 10mIU/mL) before
      immunization, additional 2 doses will be required with 1 month interval.
