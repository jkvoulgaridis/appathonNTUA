      Effectiveness analysis of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced colon

      Participants in this study selected patients according to homogeneous inclusion criteria and
      will be treated either with a uniform protocol of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and
      complementary chemotherapy (intervention group), or with the standard scheme of postoperative
      surgery and chemotherapy (control group ). All patients will be studied basally through
      clinical examinations and radiological and endoscopic tests usually used to reach the
      diagnosis of Locally Advanced Colon Cancer . In the group of patients receiving neoadjuvant
      treatment, the CT scan will be repeated after the completion of preoperative chemotherapy to
      restage the disease and quantify the degree of tumor response.

      Finally, the project tries to determine whether the neoadjuvant treatment scheme increases
      disease-free survival (SLE) at 2 and 5 years and overall survival (OS) at 5 years. Likewise,
      the toxicity derived from chemotherapy treatment and perioperative morbidity and mortality
      will be analyzed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the therapeutic procedure. The
      rate of completion of chemotherapy in both groups will also be compared.
