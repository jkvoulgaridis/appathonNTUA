  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-market clinical study (registry study) to collect post-market safety and clinical
      utility data in European patients with chronic bronchitis treated with RheOx.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RheOx is a device-based, energy delivery system that delivers high frequency short duration
      energy to the airway epithelium and sub-mucosal tissue layers. The energy is delivered via a
      proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.

      Two sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart. The right lung is treated at the
      first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session
      (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a
      respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a
      bronchoscopic procedure. The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anaesthesia. It is
      anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total.
      Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the
      two bronchoscopies.

      Subjects will be required to submit to several tests and questionnaires during the study
      including respiratory function tests.
