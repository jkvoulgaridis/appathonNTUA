  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For recurrent or persistent advanced cervical cancer patients, the first-line chemotherapy
      was based on platinum. However, if they were refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy, there
      were no other more effective medications or treatment. The marketing of anti-PD-1 antibody
      has provided an opportunity of curative management. This single arm, open, phase II trial
      would recruit 34 eligible patients. A combination of anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab and
      albumin-bound paclitaxel would be given for first 9 patients. If at least total 2 patients
      achieved complete or partial remission, or at least total 6 patients achieved complete or
      partial remission or stable disease, the same regimen would be given for rest patients. The
      primary end is overall response rate (ORR). The second ends include progression-free
      survival, overall survival, disease control rate, remission duration, and adverse events. A
      molecular testing, mainly consisting of genomic analysis, will be carried in the oncologic
      tissues.
