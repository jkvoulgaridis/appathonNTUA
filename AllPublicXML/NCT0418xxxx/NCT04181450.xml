  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is an important musculoskeletal problem that causes clinical, social and
      economic losses. LBP, which affects approximately 85% of the lifetime population, becomes
      chronic LBP in 23% of individuals lasting 3 months or more. Although there are various forms
      of LBP, the most common form is non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). There are no specific and
      definable pathologies in NSLBP such as a history of spinal surgery, presence of neurological
      deficit, facet joint problem, disc herniation and sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

      Biodex Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) (BBS) is a device used for
      objective evaluation of static and dynamic balance, allowing free movement in mediolateral
      and anteroposterior directions. The validity-reliability studies of the BBS were conducted in
      various populations including active, non-active, young adult and geriatric individuals, and
      individuals with ankle sprains. The validity-reliability study of individuals with NSLBP was
      reported by Sherafat et al. has a strong-excellent correlation with four-square step test,
      timed-up-and-go test, Berg Balance Scale, and single leg stance test.

      Studies have emphasized the use of BBS in geriatric individuals with NSLBP, but no data on
      the cut-off scores of this system have been found. The determination of a cut-off score with
      high sensitivity and specificity is thought to be beneficial for detecting deterioration in
      functional status in geriatric individuals with NSLBP. Therefore, the aim of our study is to
      determine BBS cut-off scores in geriatric individuals with NSLBP.

      Low back pain (LBP) is an important musculoskeletal problem that causes clinical, social and
      economic losses. LBP, which affects approximately 85% of the lifetime population, becomes
      chronic LBP in 23% of individuals lasting 3 months or more. Although there are various forms

      definable pathologies in NSLBP such as a history of spinal surgery, presence of neurological
      deficit, facet joint problem, disc herniation and sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

      Although there are studies examining the changes in various positions in geriatric
      individuals with NSLBP, maintaining and maintaining postural control during standing position
      has been the focus of current studies. According to the systematic review study on the effect
      of sensory manipulations on postural release changes in individuals with NSLBP, the results
      are uncertain and further studies are needed. For example, in cases where sensory systems (eg
      visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular) that are effective in achieving postural control are
      not manipulated, some studies report greater release size in NSLBP patients, while others
      find that the size of release is similar to healthy individuals. Sherafat et al. Emphasized
      that the evaluation of gravity center changes in static environment may be effective in the
      emergence of these contradictory results. As expressed in this study, standing still on a
      static platform may be an obstacle to detect small postural stability and balance differences
      between individuals with and without NSLBP. In this context, testing of geriatric individuals
      with NSLBP in the standing position on a mobile platform such as the Biodex Balance System
      (BBS) (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) and exposure to more stringent equilibrium
      conditions will yield more sensitive results in assessing postural stability and balance.

    <description>The BBS will be used to assess postural performance of participants. The movable platform of the BBS allows up to 20° of surface tilt in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. The device is equipped with computer software (Biodex, version 3.1; Biodex Medical Systems). Medial-lateral stability index (MLSI) will be assessed.</description>

    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BergBS) will be used as a gold-standard test to measure postural performance of participants. The BergBS is a qualitative measure that assesses postural performance via performing functional activities such as reaching, bending, transferring, and standing that incorporates most components of postural control: sitting and transferring safely between chairs; standing with feet apart, feet together, in single-leg stance, and feet in the tandem Romberg position with eyes-open or eyes-closed; reaching and stooping down to pick something off the floor. Each item is scored along a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, each grade with well-established criteria. Zero indicates the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function. The total score ranges from 0 to 56.</description>

        Our study will be planned as a cross-sectional study. 52 geriatric individuals with NSLBP
        who applied to the Orthopedics and Traumatology Outpatient Clinic will be included in the
        study if they meet the inclusion criteria. These individuals will be evaluated by an
        experienced physiotherapist in the laboratory for the variables examined during the day.
