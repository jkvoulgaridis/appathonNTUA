      ASA fasting guidelines are only applicable to healthy elective surgery patients. Measuring
      gastric volume now is not easy, and scintigraphy has remained the gold standard technique for
      many years. This prospective observational study aim to explore the gastric emptying of type
      2 diabetic patients.

      ASA fasting guidelines are only applicable to healthy elective surgery patients. Measuring
      gastric volume now is not easy, and scintigraphy has remained the gold standard technique for
      many years. Ultrasound has progressively emerged as a useful substitute due to its reduced
      cost and ease of performance.

      Using gastric ultrasound measure gastric antrum cross-sectional area to determine whether
      patients are empty stomach, help anesthesiologists in preoperative evaluation of diabetic
      patients with the risk of aspiration, so as to guide the anesthesiologist take effective
      interventions, this prospective observational study aim to explore the gastric emptying of
      type 2 diabetic patients.

    <measure>Perlas grading scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 3-point grading system (grades 0, 1, and 2) based exclusively on qualitative sonographic assessment of the gastric antrum.If a patient's antrum appears empty in both supine and right lateral positions (grade 0), it is likely truly empty. If it appears only mildly distended in the right lateral decubitus position, but not in the supine position (grade 1), the patient likely has a very small volume of gastric fluid within the limits of what is known to be &quot;safe&quot;. An antrum that is distended in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions (grade 2) denotes a gastric fluid volume beyond the limits of what is considered safe.</description>
