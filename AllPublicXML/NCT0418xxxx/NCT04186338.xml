  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is getting more common and challenging to treat in children and adolescents with
      myelomeningocele. Therefore, it is becoming more important to determine daily physical
      activity in these patients. Daily walking performance and average steps per day in patients
      with low lumbar and sacral level myelomeningocele are shown to not differ from healthy
      controls. Step counts can not reflect all torsional accelerations associated with daily
      living activities. Omnidirectional accelerometers provide all types of body movement outputs
      and give detailed parameters of physical activity level and energy expenditure. There is no
      data about energy expenditure and physical activity level of the patients with
      myelomeningocele in daily routine. This study aims to quantify energy expenditure and
      physical activity of children and adolescents with low lumbar and sacral level
      myelomeningocele.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with low lumbar and sacral level myelomeningocele, and age-, sex-,
      and BMI-matched controls were included. Omnidirectional accelerometer monitor (Actical®) was
      used to assess activity energy expenditure and daily durations spent in sedentary, light
      activity and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

    <measure>Average Activity energy expenditure (AEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>After wearing monitors for five consecutive days</time_frame>
    <description>Activity energy expenditure (AEE) (kcal/kg/min) refers to thermogenesis from all activities associated with daily living. An average amount of three valid weekdays will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Average physical activity durations</measure>
    <time_frame>After wearing monitors for five consecutive days</time_frame>
    <description>The sedentary level (min) is the total amount of time when AEE below 0.01 kcal/kg/min. The light level is the total amount of time when AEE between 0.01 and 0.04 kcal/kg/min. The moderate level is the total amount of time when AEE between 0.04 and 0.10 kcal/kg/min. The vigorous level (min) is the total amount of time when AEE above 0.10 kcal/kg/min.</description>

    <description>All participants were instructed to wear monitors for five consecutive days except during water-based activities. Data for each participant was collected to ensure included three valid weekdays. Daily activity energy expenditure (kcal/kg/min), and sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous levels (min) were examined using a software program.</description>
