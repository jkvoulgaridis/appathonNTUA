  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label, phase III study comparing the efficacy and
      safety of apatulamide combined with concomitant prostate-bed salvage radiotherapy (SRT) and
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus concomitant prostate-bed SRT and ADT in high-risk
      postprostatectomy biochemically relapsed prostate cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CARLHA-2 study is to determine if the combination of apalutamide with 6
      months of LHRH agonists and radiotherapy results in an improvement of progression-free
      survival (PFS) in comparison to the combination of 6 months of LHRH agonists with
      radiotherapy in high-risk postprostatectomy biochemically relapsed prostate cancer patients.

      Radical prostatectomy must have been done at least 6 months before inclusion and is not part
      of this study.

      Patients after radical prostatectomy and biochemical relapse will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either 6 months of LHRH agonists + SRT or 6 months of LHRH agonists + SRT +
      6 months of apalutamide.

      The stratification variables include Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), negative
      resection margins, extension to seminal vesicle(s), and PSA doubling time.

    <time_frame>At baseline, 3 months, 6 months, every 6 months up to 5 years then every 12 months up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, 3 months, 6 months, every 6 months up to 5 years then every 12 months up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>This EORTC prostate cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.
The prostate cancer module is a 25-item questionnaire designed for use among patients with localized and metastatic prostate cancer. It includes subscales assessing urinary symptoms (9 items), bowel symptoms (4 items), treatment-related symptoms (6 items) and sexual functioning (6 items). Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, 3 months, 6 months, every 6 months up to 5 years then every 12 months up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) is multidimensional, self-administered questionnaire composed of 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function (erectile function [6 items], orgasmic function [2 items], sexual desire [2 items], and intercourse satisfaction [3 items]) and overall satisfaction (2 items). Using a 6-point Likert scale (questions 1 to 10) and 5-point Likert scale (questions 15 to 15), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms. The total score for each domain can therefore classifies the severity of erectile dysfunction into five categories: no (score 26-30), mild (22-25), mild to moderate (17-21), moderate (11-16), and severe (1-10) erectile dysfunction.</description>

    <description>Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale is a self-reported questionnaire to assess independent living skills for older adults. This questionnaire, composed of 31 questions organized into 8 domains (ability to use telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundering, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medications, and ability to handle finances), is designed to identify improvement or deterioration of a person functioning over time. Each domain is scored 0-1 for a summary score ranging from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent).</description>
