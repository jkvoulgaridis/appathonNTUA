  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute leukaemia (AL) is an aggressive but potentially curable cancer that can affect women of
      childbearing age. When a pregnancy is complicated by a diagnosis of AL, clinicians face a
      complex dilemma: to balance risking the mother's survival through delaying treatment, against
      the potential harm to the foetus through exposure to cancer drugs. Reports suggest that,
      providing the first trimester is avoided, successful treatment of AL during pregnancy is
      possible, and considered safe. However, there is currently no standard approach to treatment
      of these women.

      This observational study aims to monitor and record the current treatment and outcomes of
      patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia during or prior to pregnancy. Patients will receive
      the treatment recommended by their doctor, the study will not alter the treatment pathway of
      participants. This study will establish a new research database of Leukaemia in Pregnancy,
      initially collecting data from cases since August 2009, and any new cases that are diagnosed
      during the current funding period.

      The initial planned analyses from this dataset will enable more robust, evidence-based
      recommendations to be made on how to monitor and manage these patients, and will add value to
      and improve the existing British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines,
      which were largely derived from expert opinion. This should enable healthcare professionals
      to have greater confidence in managing these patients, leading to a more standardised
      approach to providing high quality care. The study will benefit National Health Service
      Trusts and patients across the United Kingdom through more informed clinical decision making
      with regards to the care they receive. It will also provide an important data resource which
      researchers can apply to use in further analyses, with plans to continue data collection if
      further funding is obtained.

      A registry-based cohort study to identify and collect data on all women receiving a diagnosis
      of AL or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and all women with a history of AL or
      high-risk MDS who fall pregnant within the study period. This is an observational study, and
      patients will receive usual care as determined by their Loco-regional multidisciplinary team.

      We aim to approach all consultant haematologists involved in the care of a woman diagnosed
      with AL during pregnancy, and request that they report all known cases, creating a national
      dataset. For prospective cases, women will be identified at diagnosis and tracked throughout
      their pregnancy to allow comparison of the respective outcomes for both mother and neonate.
      There will be additional follow-up points at 2 and 4 years, to accurately document the
      subsequent outcomes of the mother and obtain details of any further pregnancies they may have
      had. The follow-up periods were chosen as two and four years. Two years is where the most
      incidences of relapse occur, and four years is considered decisive with regards to remission.
      In addition, consultant haematologists across the UK will be asked to provide retrospective
      data on any cases occurring since August 2009 (both pre-and post-introduction of the 2015
      BCSH guidelines), to gain an overview of current and past approaches to patient management,
      and to serve as comparators to assess the current and future impact of the BCSH guidelines.

      Consent will be sought from the patient whenever reasonably practicable for the use of the
      information in the database. In historic cases when to patient is no longer in contact with
      the hospital (e.g. no longer in clinical follow-up), to avoid causing any emotional distress
      the relevant approvals will be gained to process these cases without consent. All information
      will be retrieved from the patient's medical records and will require no further patient
      involvement beyond consenting for the use of their information.

      Data from the LIPS database will be hosted and managed by the Hull Health Trials Unit (HHTU)
      using their secure online data capture system RedCap Cloud (RCC) and BOX Governance file
      storage system. HHTU hold a NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit covering these
      information systems. RCC is a cloud based EDC system provided by nPhase. Data is stored on
      dedicated RCC hardware in EU data centres (including real-time backup) managed by Amazon Web
      Services to industry standards outlinedin ISO 27001, PCI DSS, SOC 1 -3, FISMA, CIS, CSA, NIST
      and UK Cloud Security Principles. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit. RCC deliver
      compliance to HIPAA, CFR Part 11, and EMEA Annex 11.

      Data checks are built in to the database to compare inputted data with predefined ranges and
      values with data management according to the data management plan with data querying of any
      missing or anomalous data. A statistical analysis plan will be prepared before the analysis
      of the initial dataset.
