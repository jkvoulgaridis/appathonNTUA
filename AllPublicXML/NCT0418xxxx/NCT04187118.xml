  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant lymphomas are considered as among the most chemo-sensitive cancers. ML are cured in
      more than 85% of patient, the majority with complete response. After this active phase of
      treatment, patients are in &quot;after cancer period&quot;. Toulouse University Hospital developed
      since 2006 the Ambulatory Medical Assistance for After Cancer program on lymphoma patient.
      Ambulatory Medical Assistance for After Cancer is very efficient for detecting physical and
      psychological complications which impact quality of life. The investigators identified 22% of
      lymphoma patients who had a reduced quality of life one year after the end of chemotherapy.
      The present study aims to investigate the evolution of observed complications and identify
      cancer care pathway which decrease the quality of life reduction risk in patients one year
      after lymphoma chemotherapy.

      Quality of life, as well anxiety, depression, social isolation, fear of cancer recurrence,
      post traumatic stress, will be measured in lymphoma patients, after a first line
      chemotherapy. Care cancer pathway will be also evaluated. Self-administered questionnaires
      will be performed on website (www.hospitalidee.fr) after inclusion and 12 months after.
