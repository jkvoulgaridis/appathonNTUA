  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to evaluate whether weekly antenatal testing in pregnant women with
      body mass index (BMI) 30-40 in the third trimester is associated with earlier delivery when
      compared to growth ultrasounds every 4 weeks. The investigators will also assess the
      differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes between the groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, the prevalence of obesity has dramatically increased in women in
      reproductive age. It is well known that obesity has been associated with increased risk of
      antenatal complications, maternal and perinatal morbidity, including higher risk of
      stillbirth. Studies including obese women without other antepartum comorbidities have shown
      that up to 11% of pregnancies are complicated with fluid and fetal growth abnormalities.
      According to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines,
      antepartum surveillance has not been proven to improve pregnancy outcomes in such cases and
      no specific recommendations for antepartum surveillance in obese women have been established.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average gestational age at delivery of participating women's babies</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>This is to measure the number of weeks that the baby has been in the uterus. It is measured from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the date of delivery. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks. A significant delay in gestational age of delivery would be &gt; 7 days out of this range.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average birth weight of participating women's babies</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>This is to measure the body weight of a baby at birth. The average baby weighs about 7.5 pounds - though the range of normal is between 5.8 and 10 pounds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participating women who experienced composite maternal morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Composite maternal morbidity is defined as any of the following: chorioamnionitis, endometritis, cesarean section in labor, wound infection, transfusion, hemorrhage, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, admission to ICU or death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participating women whose babies experienced composite neonatal morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Composite neonatal morbidity is defined as any of the following: stillbirth after randomization, neonatal death within 28 days from birth, respiratory distress syndrome, Transient tachypnea of the newborn, hypoglycemia, sepsis, seizures, necrotizing enterocolitis, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ventilator support within 24 h of birth, arterial blood pH&lt;7, 5 min Apgar score &lt;3, ICU admission, prolonged hospitalization (5 days or longer).</description>

    <measure>Number of participating women whose babies experienced composite of abnormalities of fluid volume and growth</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>A composite of abnormalities of fluid volume and growth is defined as any of the following: oligohydramnios (AFI&lt;5 or maximum vertical pocket (MVP) &lt; 2) or polyhydramnios (AFI&gt;24 or MVP&gt;8); fetal growth restriction (EFW&lt;10% or AC&lt;5%) ; or large for gestational age (EFW&gt;90%), macrosomia (EFW&gt;4,000 grams).</description>
