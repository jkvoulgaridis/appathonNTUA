  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at a high risk of developing
      dementia and are an important target population for interventions that may reduce the risk of
      cognitive decline. A diagnosis of MCI or dementia also has an important impact on caregivers,
      who show increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Mindfulness meditation is a
      promising behavioural intervention that may have important benefits both for older adults
      with MCI and for caregivers. Previous research suggests that meditation may improve
      psychological wellbeing, reduce stress, and even improve cognitive function. Technology-based
      mindfulness meditation platforms may be a much-needed solution for promoting the adoption of
      mindfulness in these populations.

      The current study is a pilot randomized control trial of a mindfulness meditation
      intervention delivered via the Muse platform in two study populations: a) older adults
      diagnosed with MCI, and b) family caregivers of persons with MCI or neurodegenerative
      disorders. Muse is a mobile application for meditation that provides real-time feedback about
      the user's state of mindfulness during meditation via a headband containing
      electroencephalographic sensors (EEG) that the user wears while meditating. It is thought
      that this neurofeedback can promote learning and lead to faster improvements in meditation
      ability and, consequently, greater benefits from meditation practice.

      This aim of this pilot study is to establish the acceptability of the Muse platform as an
      intervention in the two study populations, to determine the feasibility of the randomized
      control trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6 week intervention with the Muse
      platform, and to evaluate the effect of neurofeedback on meditation. Participants will be
      randomly allocated to meditation with neurofeedback (NFB) or meditation without neurofeedback
      (no-NFB) and will complete daily meditation sessions for 6 weeks. An assessment visit before
      and after the intervention will evaluate participants' psychological well-being using
      questionnaires; their visual working memory, attention, and visual perception using
      behavioural tests; and their mindfulness ability using questionnaires and a behavioural
      measure. EEG will also be recorded using the Muse headband to examine changes in
      electrophysiological markers during cognitive tests and at rest.

      The Primary objectives of the main study are:

        1. To determine if mindfulness meditation with auditory neurofeedback (NFB) leads to
           greater improvements in mindfulness relative to a mindfulness meditation without
           neurofeedback (no-NFB).

        2. To determine if a mindfulness meditation intervention with neurofeedback leads to
           greater improvements in psychological well-being, with perceived stress levels as the
           primary outcome measure, in the two study populations, relative to a mindfulness
           meditation program without neurofeedback .

      Secondary objectives of the main study are to determine if the NFB intervention leads to
      greater improvements in 1) other measures of psychological wellbeing and 2 ) behavioural and
      EEG markers of perceptual and cognitive function, relative to the no-NFB arm, in the two
      study populations (individuals with MCI; caregivers)

      Feasibility and acceptability objectives of the pilot study

        1. To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention for older adults with MCI and family
           caregivers of persons with MCI or neurodegenerative disorders, and to examine whether
           the acceptability of the intervention is associated with the individual's technological
           abilities.

        2. To estimate the recruitment rate of older adults with MCI and family caregivers
           separately, as well as dyads of older adults with MCI and their caregivers.

        3. To determine the rate of adherence to the intervention schedule (durations per session
           and number of sessions), and the rate of completion of assessment visits and weekly
           questionnaires

        4. To determine the extent of technical expertise and time resources required of the
           experimenters to provide technical support to participants in each group

        5. To determine the feasibility of blinding experimenters to the intervention arm and of
           blinding Muse-control participants to the neurofeedback group, given that information
           about the Muse app is easily available online.

        6. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of Muse and Muse-control interventions on
           the psychological well-being, and perceptual and cognitive measures, and the standard
           deviations of these measures.

      Procedures:

      Briefly, participants will be enrolled on a continuous basis. After an initial pre-screening
      phone call or email, interested and eligible participants will come for a consenting and
      screening visit, which will include a clinical interview to screen for mental-health
      exclusion criteria, as well as exclusion related to prior use of the Muse device. All those
      eligible to proceed will return for a baseline assessment visit (Visit 2) where they will
      complete a series of computer-based task assessments and self-report questionnaires. At the
      end of the assessments, participants will be introduced to the research assistant responsible
      for the intervention (training RA). The training RA will train the participant on how to use
      the Muse headband and app associated with their training condition, as well as give
      instructions on the required training regimen. The next six weeks will consist of the
      training period. The training RA will contact participants by phone or email once a week to
      monitor for any issues. Following the training period, all participants will come back for
      Visit 3 to repeat the same assessments as were completed at baseline (Visit 2) with the
      experimenter RAs. All participants will be fully debriefed by the training RA during Visit 3
      as to which version of the app they trained with and what the differences are between the two
      apps.

      Sample size justification for the pilot study

      A minimum of 12 participants per group and condition is required to provide feasibility and
      acceptability information. However, to obtain reliable estimates of the variability of each
      outcome measure, our target sample size is 20 participants per condition (i.e., 40 MCI
      participants in total and 40 caregivers in total). The actual sample size for the pilot study
      will be limited by the timeline of the project and the combination of recruitment and
      retention rates.

      Recruitment:

      Caregivers will be recruited through advertisements on the Baycrest campus or at institutions
      that provide services for caregivers. Older adults with MCI will be recruited at Baycrest
      through advertisements and by contacting eligible participants through the Baycrest Client
      Registry.

    <masking_description>The outcomes assessor and all individuals involved in analyzing data will be blind to the participant's study arm. Only the research assistant who will be introducing participants to their meditation app will be aware of their study arm assignment. Participants will be told that they are randomized into one of two types of meditation programs, but will not be told about the difference in the two programs and will not be told if they are in the main intervention group or the control group. That said, given the nature of auditory neurofeedback, participants in the NFB group will be aware that they are receiving neurofeedback. Participants in the no-NFB group will not be experiencing any neurofeedback and, a priori, they should not be aware that neurofeedback is missing.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2/Week 1), Post-Intervention (Visit 3/Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>A modified Sternberg-type visual memory task will be used to evaluate effects on memory. Participants will view two faces shown one after another and will be asked to remember the faces and the order in which they were shown. After a brief retention interval (2 s), a number '1' or '2' will cue participants to recall the first or second face. A probe face will then appear and participants will indicate with a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; whether the probe face matched the cued face. Both reaction time and accuracy will be used to evaluate memory performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in visual attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2/Week 1), Post-Intervention (Visit 3/Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Attention will be measured using a variation of the attentional field of view task (Sekuler, Bennett, &amp; Mamelak, 2000). In the focused-central condition, participants need to report which one of four letters was briefly flashed in the centre of the screen. In the focused-peripheral condition, participants report in which quadrant a small white circle was flashed in the periphery. In the divided-attention condition, participants report which letter was presented in the centre of the screen and which quadrant contained a flash in the periphery. The duration of the visual stimuli is varied to determine the minimum duration required to achieve a threshold level of performance. The ratio of duration thresholds in the focused and divided conditions for both tasks is the measure of performance of interest.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will meditate with the help of a custom version of the Muse app, which guides users in meditation while providing auditory neurofeedback on their state of mindfulness. Participants will wear the EEG headband and headphones when completing the meditation sessions using the app. The neurofeedback consists of changing weather sounds that are heard against a background soundscape (e.g., a beach or rainforest sound). When a user is in a focused state, the weather in the soundscape is good (e.g., it is quiet or a light breeze can be heard). When a user starts mind-wandering, the weather sounds change for the worse: it begins to rain, the wind gets louder, and there may be thunder. When the user returns to a calm state, the weather sounds quiet down again and only the background soundscape is heard. Participants are asked to pay attention to the weather sounds and to use this feedback to train their mind to remain focused on the present moment.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will meditate using a custom version of the Muse app that is identical in all respects to the mobile app used by the NFB group, expect that the auditory neurofeedback is not active. Participants will wear the EEG headband and headphones when completing the meditation sessions using the app, but the soundscape during the sessions will only contain the background sounds (e.g., the breach or rainforest scene), without any changes to the weather.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mindfulness meditation delivered via a mobile app</intervention_name>
    <description>This is a six-week intervention that requires completing daily meditation sessions at home using a mobile app while wearing a four-channel EEG device (Muse,RRID:SCR_014418) and headphones. Participants are asked to increase their session duration from 5 to 15 minutes over the first 10 sessions, and continue with 15 minutes thereafter. Meditation sessions in both intervention arms consist of listening to a calm soundscape while focusing one's attention on the present moment.
Prior to starting the intervention, participants are familiarized with the mobile device, EEG headband, and the study app during an onboarding session. In this session, participants listen to four different meditation exercise instructions (e.g., focusing attention on their breath, counting breaths, thinking of meditation akin to training a puppy) that offer them techniques to use during meditation.The transcript of these exercises and a basic guide on how to use the study app and headband are provided.</description>
