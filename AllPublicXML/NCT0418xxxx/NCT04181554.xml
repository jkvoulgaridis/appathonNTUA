  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare postural stability, pelvic floor dysfunction and
      respiratory muscle strength between with and without diastasis recti abdominis in post-partum
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diastasis of recti abdominis muscles (DRAM) is defined as a separation of the two rectus
      abdominis muscles along the linea alba. Increased volume in the abdominal cavity, hormonal
      changes during pregnancy, neurodevelopmental differences, or abdominal wall laxity may
      caused. It is very common during pregnancy and may continue for eight weeks in postnatal
      period. The loss of abdominal wall stability and weakened pelvic floor muscles may occur with
      DRAM. The abdominal wall is one of the key point for body posture, trunk and pelvic
      stability. However, in our best knowledge, there is no study in the literature that evaluates
      women with and without DRA in terms of components related to postural control systems.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural stability test score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>'Postural Stability Test' will be performed using Biodex Balance System®. Volunteers will stand still on the platform and the displacement of the centre of gravity will be quantified for anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Test provides overall stability index, anterior-posterior stability index and medial-lateral stability index scores. Lower scores present better postural stability.</description>

    <measure>Limits of stability test score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>'Limits of Stability Test' will be performed using Biodex Balance System®. Subjects will stand on the platform and try to reach in eight directions spot that shown on the screen. The test results present scores for all eight directions and an overall score. Lower scores show worse performance (0= worst performance; 100= perfect performance)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory integration test score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>'Sensory integration test' will be performed using Biodex Balance System®. Volunteers will stand still on the platform in condition eyes open and closed on the firm and soft (foam) surfaces. The test scores are sway index for each condition and a composite score. Lower scores present better postural stability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength has been assessed by maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures.</description>

    <measure>Abdominal Muscle Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Volunteers will be asked to perform curl up position as long as possible. The duration time will be measured until a maximum 180 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pelvic floor dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic floor dysfunction will be assessed using &quot;Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory&quot;. Lower scores show better pelvic floor functions.</description>
