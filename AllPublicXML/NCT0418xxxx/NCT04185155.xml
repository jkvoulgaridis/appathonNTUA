  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of a simple cognitive task (a
      memory cue following by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) on intrusive memories
      (&quot;flashbacks&quot;) and other symptoms after a traumatic event. Patients presenting to a hospital
      emergency department soon after a traumatic event will be randomly allocated to either the
      simple cognitive task intervention or control. Participants will be followed up at one week
      and one month, and where possible 3 and 6 months. It is predicted that participants given the
      simple cognitive task intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories and less severe
      related clinical symptoms than those who are not. This will inform the future development of
      a simple technique to prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic event.
      Implementation and training aspects in a hospital context will also be explored. Patients use
      their smartphone for part of the intervention in the study.

    <textblock>
      This is a Randomised Controlled Trial informed by prior feasibility and pilot work
      (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03509792). The primary outcome is the number of intrusive memories
      of the traumatic event (week 5). The intervention is delivered in emergency departments of
      Swedish hospitals.

    <measure>Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R): Degree of subjective distress of post-trauma intrusion symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>One week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure that assesses subjective distress after a traumatic event (with reference to ED event). Here we include the intrusion subscale (8 items) and the avoidance subscale (8 items). Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). Subscale scores are calculated for the Intrusion or Avoidance items summed (ranging from 0 to 32 each). Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): Anxiety and depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>One week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>One week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Full scale is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses current symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The PCL-5 yields a total symptom severity score which ranges from 0 to 80. Subscale symptom severity scores for DSM-5 symptom cluster B - intrusion symptoms (items 1-5), cluster C - avoidance (items 6-7), cluster D - negative alterations in cognitions and mood (items 8-14), and cluster E - alterations in arousal and reactivity (items 15-20). Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>7 bespoke items including questions about study participation e.g. how acceptable was it to do the task at the emergency department? Rated on 11-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely), higher scores indicate higher acceptability; and questions about what has happened since the study with a yes/no response e.g. have you had any psychological or medical treatment since our last contact; and items with a free text response field e.g. do you have any other comments.</description>

Each 5-point scale is reverse scored (0 - 4) then summed. Possible total scores range from 0 - 8, with higher values indicative of better sleep.</description>
