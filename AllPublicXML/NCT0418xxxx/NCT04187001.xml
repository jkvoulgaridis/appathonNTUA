      Delphi study about home exercise protocol development for neck pain in young smartphone's
      users

      Introduction: The number of smartphones users has arised in the last years due to its variety
      of functions and conveniences, differing from the conventional phone and replacing even a
      computer for its practicality, however, along with this, musculoskeletal disorders arise as a
      result of overuse, because during the use of the smartphone, the device is positioned below
      eye level and the user keep your look down leading to a cervical flexion posture, which can
      lead to pain in the neck region, which increases as time spent using the smartphone due to
      the anteriorization of the head.

      Currently, there are several types of treatments for cervicalgia, applied according to the
      therapist's choice and patient's conditions and preferences, however, there are no reports of
      an effective self-performing treatment aiming to stabilizing the cervical, giving
      musculoskeletal balance, and focus on reducing pain associated with smartphone use without
      removing this factor.

      It is important the promotion of a self-performing treatment, resulting in a high cost
      benefit because patient does not have to move to perform the treatment outside his or her
      home, does not need financial resources and demands little time to perform it. In addition to
      decreasing the frequency and intensity of hospitalizations and government costs incurred in
      this musculoskeletal disorder. Therefore, the study aims to construct, validate and adapt a
      self-performing exercise protocol in reducing cervical pain in young smartphone users.

      Methods: The first phase was the development of the first version of the protocol, through
      literature search; in the second phase, the content was validated, through evaluation by a
      committee of nine physiotherapists judges using the Delphi technique; and the last phase of
      the protocol, the cultural adequacy, is being performed through evaluation by fifteen
      participants of the target population to assemble the final version of the protocol.
