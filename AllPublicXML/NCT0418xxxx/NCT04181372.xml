  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is seen in a relatively heterogeneous group of
      patients with ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) lymph node involvement. The relative roles of
      different treatment modalities are not clear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant double-drug chemotherapy containing platinum plus
      anlotinib hydrochloride in patients with stage III(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer.

      This is a prospective, open-label, multi-institutional, positive medicine control of equal
      rank comparative study of neoadjuvant double-drug chemotherapy with platinum plus anlotinib
      hydrochloride in stage III(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer.The main purpose of this study was
      to compare the difference in N2 downgrade rate of lymph node and resectability rate between
      the experimental and control groups, to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib hydrochloride, and
      to observe and evaluate its objective response rate(ORR)，Disease-free Survival (DFS)and
      overall survival(OS).

    <description>ORR is the number of participants with a Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) divided by the total number of randomized participants per arm, then multiplied by 100. Response is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions compared to baseline or the complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) and no new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
