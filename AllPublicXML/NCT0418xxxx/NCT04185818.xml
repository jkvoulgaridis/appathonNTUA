      The People's Trial seeks to help enhance the public's understanding of randomised trials by
      facilitating the involvement of the public in the trial research process. The public have,
      through an online format, guided the development and design of The People's Trial randomised
      controlled trial. The People's trial is a parallel, online randomised controlled trial to
      determine if reading a book in bed makes a difference to sleep in comparison to not reading a
      book in bed.

      Members of the public will be recruited through online platforms. Informed consent will be
      obtained from all participants prior to trial registration. Consent forms will be provided
      online prior to registration for The People's Trial. Participants will be required to
      acknowledge that they have read the consent form and give consent to proceed with trail
      registration.

      Participants will be randomly allocated into one of two groups:

      Group 1: Reading a book in bed

      Group 2: Not reading a book in bed

    <description>Sleep quality will be measured using the single item sleep quality scale (SQS) (Snyder et al 2018). The SQS is a self-administered questionnaire in which respondents rate overall quality of sleep over a 7-day recall period on a discretizing visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (0 = terrible, 1-3 = poor, 4-6 = fair, 7-9 = good, and 10 = excellent)</description>

    <description>This will be measured using the PROMIS Short Form Sleep Disturbance Scale which measures eight items on 5-point scale to rate the frequency of problems related to insufficient sleep in the past seven days</description>

    <measure>Daytime sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of randomisation- refers to sleep in the last 7 days only</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of daytime sleepiness will be measured using a a single item with a 10-point scale. Respondents are instructed to indicate their sleepiness at that moment by choosing a number between 1 (not sleepy at all) and 10 (very sleepy). Others have found a single item to measure sleep quality produces reproducible and valid data (Cappelleri, et al 2009, Riegel et al 2013).</description>
