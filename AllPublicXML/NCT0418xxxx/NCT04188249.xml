  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, observational, single-arm, registry study based on data received
      from Chinese Registry of rheumatoid arthritis (CREDIT) database to register 200 Chinese RA
      patients treated with golimumab in one year. Patient characteristic, clinical effectiveness
      and drug adherence of golimumab will be evaluated.

      This multicenter (12 centers), prospective program will register 200 RA patients routinely
      receiving golimumab treatment. Doctor will record the disease evaluation, concomitant drug,
      adverse events and laboratory tests based on patient's visit till they withdraw from clinical
      visit. Doctor will still collect above information whether patient interrupt or stop
      golimumab till the end of program or patient withdraw permanently.
