      This research is being done because the investigators are looking for new and better ways to
      treat a type of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer. This type of breast
      cancer can be more difficult to treat than other types of breast cancer as it does not
      respond to drugs such as hormonal therapies. One type of treatment that looks promising is
      immunotherapy using new drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoints help to
      regulate the immune system and can stop the immune system from attacking cancer cells. Immune
      checkpoint inhibitors block this 'off-switch' and aim to help the immune system control the
      cancer. These drugs have been very effective in other cancers such as melanoma and are now
      being tested in breast cancer. In this study patients will receive an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor called avelumab. Half the patients on the study will also receive aspirin tablets
      for approximately 18 days as the investigators wish to compare the effects of avelumab alone
      versus in combination with aspirin. Patients will attend hospital approximately five times in
      order to complete all necessary study assessments. The first visit screens patients for
      suitability, after which a baseline visit will collect the first of two breast tissue
      biopsies. At the third visit a single dose of Avelumab will be given via an infusion (a drip
      in the forearm). Patients will then return approximately two weeks later for a second breast
      tissue biopsy before having a final follow up visit another two weeks later. Blood and urine
      samples will be taken at various visits throughout the study to help us learn more about the
      effects these treatments may have on the immune system and on breast cancer cells.

      TNBC is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with poor survival and new
      treatments are needed. A key feature of cancer is its ability to go undetected by the immune
      system. Recent developments in cancer research have identified immune checkpoints as a
      possible treatment option as they seem to promote an anti-tumour immune response.

      Some breast cancers have considerable cancer cell infiltration, which has been associated
      with better prognosis. This is where white blood cells have permeated the cancer cell and
      infiltrated the infected cell in an attempt to 'cure' the infected cell. Greater
      immune-sensitivity is thought to correlate with greater cancer cell infiltration therefore
      researchers are looking at ways in which immune-sensitivity can be improved.

      One approach is to target inflammation that is known to play a major role in cancer
      development and progression. Certain proteins can often be abnormally expressed in many
      cancers. In preclinical models the investigators recently demonstrated that the presence of
      certain cancer cell-derived proteins is critical for the growth of tumours formed by
      melanoma, colorectal and breast mouse cancer cell lines. In the mouse preclinical trials it
      indicated that by blocking the cancer cells ability to produce these proteins was associated
      with a marked shift in the inflammatory profile. To test this theory, this study will use
      aspirin as the chosen protein inhibitor and it is speculated that the addition of aspirin
      might enhance the efficacy of the immune checkpoint blockade, avelumab.

      TRIAL AIMS &amp; DESIGN

      The aim of this trial is to determine whether aspirin enhances the efficacy of avelumab by
      promoting a greater anti-cancer immune response. This is a multicentre study recruiting
      patients with confirmed TNBC from across four trial sites within the United Kingdom. It is
      anticipate that 50 participants will need to be screened in order to successfully enrol 42
      patients onto the trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two arms:

        -  21 patients into Arm A: Avelumab + Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)

        -  21 patients into Arm B: Avelumab + Aspirin + PPI

      The estimated duration of participation for a participant is up to 10 weeks. Each subject
      will be asked to complete 5 study visits. After successfully completing a Screening Visit
      (Visit 1), each eligible subject will attend for a Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and will be
      randomly assigned to treatment ARM A or ARM B. As part of the baseline visit subjects will
      have their first of two breast tumour biopsies. All subjects will commence their PPI
      following the baseline visit, those subjects randomised to ARM B will also commence their
      Aspirin at this time. At visit 3 all subjects will receive their Avelumab infusion. At Visit
      4 (Follow up Visit A) each subject will undergo their second research biopsy and further
      research blood sampling this will be the first of two follow up visits, with Visit 5 (Follow
      up Visit B) concluding the patients participation.

      Visit windows have been used to aid visit planning in the hope that most research
      appointments can take place in line with patients' ordinary care visits so as to reduce any
      burden inflicted on the patient.

      Adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be collected from the time of
      randomisation and will continue to be collected up until Visit 5 (Follow up Visit B). All
      post biopsy treatment will be at the discretion of the subject's treating physician per local
      standard of care.

      PATIENT IDENTIFICATION &amp; SCREENING The study will be conducted as a multi-centre trial
      consisting of four NHS secondary care out-paints clinics from across the United Kingdom. Each
      site has been chosen for their expertise in oncology and their ability to identify patients
      for the trial directly from their clinics with each centre treating between 20 to 40 patients
      per annum; this pool of patients will constitute the source of recruitment in the study, PIC
      sites may also be used.

      Potential participants will be identified by the Principal Investigators multidisciplinary
      team following recent diagnosis of TNBC. The multidisciplinary team shall be trained on the
      study protocol and required to sign the trial delegation and training log in advance of
      working on the trial or identifying participants. Potential participants will have at least
      24 hours to read the patient information and decide if they would like to participate in the
      study. Participants must have the capacity to provide fully informed consent. Participants
      must not participate in any other therapeutic trials whilst on study treatments, however once
      all study treatments as specified by trial schema are completed, participation in further
      studies will not be affected.

         15. Active infection requiring systemic treatment.

         16. Current or previous regular use of aspirin (at any dose) or current use of another
             NSAID for any indication (see appendix IV for list of medications not permitted in the
             trial). Regular aspirin use is defined as taking aspirin more than twice in any given
             week for more than 4 consecutive weeks. Current NSAID use is defined as taking any
             NSAID for more than a week in the preceding month. If investigators feel that this
             definition may unfairly exclude a participant, this can be discussed with the CI/MCTU
             and a case by case decision will be made.

         17. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to the study treatments.
