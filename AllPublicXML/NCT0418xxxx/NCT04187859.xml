  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PARCHED (Prompting And encouRaging Community Hydration through EDucation) is studying how to
      improve the hydration (fluid intake) of people living at home who use catheters. The
      investigator would like to see if improved hydration (fluid intake) reduces the risk of
      frailty.

      PARCHED will randomise four areas in Cwm Taf University Health Board to receive one of four
      different interventions. Individuals will receive an intervention based on which area they
      live in, each participant will take part in the study for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PARCHED is a cluster feasibility randomized control trial (RCT) exploring the potential of an
      innovative prompting cup and education as person-centred and holistic tools to empower
      nursing leadership to reduce frailty in a catheterised community-dwelling population. This
      project will investigate interventions to improve hydration as potentially economically
      viable solutions to reducing frailty in a vulnerable population. Interventions have been
      developed using behaviour change theory and techniques. 80 participants will be recruited and
      will receive one of three interventions or usual care for a period of 12 weeks, data will be
      collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and
      routine hospital records will be collected or accessed as part of the study.
