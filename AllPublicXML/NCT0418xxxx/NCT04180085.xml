  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation (TC) is the standard treatment for terminal heart failure. Chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication responsible for increased mortality and
      morbidity. The main risk factors for progression to CKD are advanced age, pre-transplantation
      CKD, degradation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the first year post-transplantation,
      and nephrotoxicity of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI).

      Indeed, these molecules (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), the cornerstone of immunosuppressive
      treatment, have nephrotoxic effects in the short term (by a hemodynamic effect) and in the
      long term (by a pro-fibrosin effect).

      In renal transplantation (TR), belatacept, a costimulation-inhibiting molecule, used de novo,
      without CNI, with induction by anti-receptor antibody of Interleukines 2, preserves kidney
      function. Despite this great advantage, its development is still hampered by a higher number
      of rejections compared to the CNI group in this originator study. Based on the experience
      gained in TR, which has since validated its use, the hypothesis is that in heart
      transplantation, belatacept (Nulojix) combined with minimization of CNI (with induction by
      antilymphocyte serum), could significantly improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in
      patients at risk of CKD (by removing them from dialysis and possible kidney transplantation)
      without increasing the risk of rejection.
