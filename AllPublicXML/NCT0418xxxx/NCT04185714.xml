  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with migraine, neck pain and trigger points in the neck muscles are common in
      clinical practice. This study was to investigate whether kinesiotaping applied to the
      cervical muscles has a clinical effect on pressure pain threshold, disability and quality of
      life in patients with migraine.

      Patients with episodic migraine who were followed up by department of neurology in regional
      hospital will be included in the study. The Clinical Research Ethics committee approved the
      study (protocol no 10840098-604.01.1-E.6803).

      Inclusion criterias are aged between 18-60 years, the patients with episodic migraine by
      neurologist according to ICHD-3 Beta criteria, headache frequency in 1 month &lt; 15 days and
      pain severity according to VAS above 40 mm.

      Exclusion criterias are other headache types, contraindication for KT technique, cervical
      disc disorders, systemic rheumatic disease, fibromyalgia pain syndrome, myofascial pain
      syndrome, temporamandibular joint dysfunction, pregnancy, overuse medication, patients who
      had gotten rehabilitation programme before at least 3 months ago and anaesthetic blockage
      before at least 6 months ago.

      All patients will allocate 3 groups. The patients with episodic migraine were randomly
      assigned to control group (n=15), placebo group (n=15) and experimental group (n= 15).

      Outcome measures Demographic data and headache characteristics of the patients (frequency,
      duration, onset of headache, family history, onset age of headache, pain triggering factors,
      and localization of headache), presence of neck pain and disability of the last 1 month will
      evaluate before and after 6 weeks of treatment via self-administered questionnaire. Pressure
      Pain Algometry (Baseline Dolorimeter), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Migraine Disability
      Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) will use as the assessment method in the
      6-week follow-up.

      Intervention All 3 groups will give a 6-week home exercise programme and 30-minute walking
      activity for 3 days per week. Home exercise programme that included neck and head isotonic
      and isometric exercises show by physiotherapist. The participants will administere the
      exercises every day for 20 minutes. Weekly telephone calls will make to control group
      patients to encourage them to perform the exercise. Sham taping will be implemented to the
      placebo group at twice a week. Kinesiotaping will be applied to the trapezius and deep
      cervical muscles twice a week for experimental group. The taping replace every 3 days.

      Statistical Analyses Data will be expressed as mean, standard deviation and median.
      Significance between pre- and post-treatment pain, disability and quality of life variables
      was statistically significant with Paired Stutend's t - test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests;
      Intergroup significance will be analyzed by One Way Variation Analysis (ANOVA) and Kruskall
      Wallis. For statistical significance p &lt;0.05 probability value will be accepted.
