      This study evaluates weight loss effect of the method LEVA by Bertz et al in subjects with
      overweight or obesity that are remitted to Närhälsan Dietistenhet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The method &quot;Lifestyle at Effective Weight Loss During Breastfeeding&quot; (LEVA method by Bertz et
      al) has been scientifically studied to provide sustainable weight loss for women with
      overweight or obesity after childbirth. Primary health care centers in Västra
      Götalandsregionen treat adult patients with overweight and obesity. If the LEVA method by
      Bertz et el also produces weight loss to other patient groups than women post partum, the
      method could be used as a treatment alternative.
