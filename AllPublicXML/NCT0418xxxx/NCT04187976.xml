  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) are frequently described as
      unified airway inflammatory diseases. Both heavily impacts quality of life with substantial
      productivity loss. They share the same pathophysiologic pattern based upon proTh2 immune
      response with blood eosinophils recruitment. Eosinophils are the major actor of persistent
      mucosal inflammation by promoting their own survival, by attracting other inflammatory cells
      and by producing cytotoxic proteins involved in mucosal remodeling.

      Promising anti-Th2 therapeutic approaches (i.e.anti-IgE, anti-interleukin 5 (IL-5),
      anti-IL-4, anti-IL-13) are considered as effective alternative options to long-term
      corticosteroid treatment. Their advantage in recalcitrant CRSwNP is under consideration.
      Moreover, we still need to delineate the good responders to improve theirs indications.

      The objective is to assess blood eosinophil immunophenotypes in asthma or CRSwNP. Flow
      cytometric expression of activation markers on eosinophil membrane will be compared with a
      group of healthy subjects. Innovative data on eosinophil involvement in airway diseases will
      be obtained. The major outcome will be to depict patients' endotypes for a better selection
      of immunotherapies.

        All patients for the study will be targeted either during hospitalization in Pneumology for
        uncontrolled asthma patients, during ENT visit for scheduling of sinus surgery
        (recalcitrant CRSwNP).

        The healthy subjects are going to be screened in the Clinical Investigation Center of the
        University Hospital of Lille. Subjects will be contacted by phone after selection in the
        database.

        symptoms and proven variable airway obstruction, and assessed by an expert pulmonologist
        according to spirometry criteria (absolute and weighed Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) and
        Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) before and after 2 test),(see CRF for details). Uncontrolled

             bilateral sinus opacification on CT scan. Briefly, CRSwNP is considered as refractory
