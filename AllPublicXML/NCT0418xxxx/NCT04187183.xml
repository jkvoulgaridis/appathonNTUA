      The aim of the study is to compare the triple infiltration of Fresh Platelet Rich Plasma with
      concentrated Leukocytes against triple infiltration of Fresh Platelet Rich Plasma Without
      Concentrated Leukocytes in the treatment of Knee Cartilage Degeneration in a Double Blind
      Randomized Controlled Trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet Rich Plasma has a consolidated use in the field of orthopedic surgery to reduce
      inflammation, promoting bone regeneration and healing of surgical wounds.

      Some clinical studies demonstrated the utility of the intra-articular infiltration of
      Platelet Rich Plasma in the treatment of knee articular cartilage lesions, becoming a common
      conservative strategies in the management of these diseases.

      Actually, there are some different kinds of PRP formulations, in particular, the scientific
      debate is focusing on the role of Leukocytes and if it is better using fresh or frozen PRP.

      At the moment don't exist randomized controlled clinical studies comparing fresh PRP rich in
      Leukocyte against PRP poor in Leukocyte in the treatment of knee cartilage lesions.

      The study has two groups of patients, the first will undergo to three infiltrations of Fresh
      Platelet Rich Plasma With Concentrated Leukocytes and the second will undergo to three
      infiltrations of Fresh Platelet Rich Plasma Without Concentrated Leukocytes, each
      infiltrations will be done weekly.

    <measure>IKDC-subjective score (International Knee Documentation Committee)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>It is a specific subjective rating scale for te knee. Iti s one of the most reliable tools for assessing knee diseases. The survey examines three categories: symptoms, sport activity, knee function.</description>

    <measure>KOOS score (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale</description>

    <measure>EQ-VAS (EuroQol-visual analogue scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 6, 12, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a rating scale for assessing the health state of the patient. The scale ranging from 0 (the worst health state) to 100 (the best health state)</description>

    <measure>Tegner Activity Level Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 6, 12, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Survey useful for assessing sport activity of the patient. The Tegner activity scale is a one-item score that graded activity based on work and sports activities on a scale of 0 to 10. Zero represents disability because of knee problems and 10 represents national or international level soccer.</description>
