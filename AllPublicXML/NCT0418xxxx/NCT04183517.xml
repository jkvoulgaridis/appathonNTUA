  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, two-part in healthy adult males. There will be up to 12
      subjects with 6 subjects in each part of the study. Subjects from Part A are eligible to
      participate in Part B.

      For Part A, each of the 6 subjects will complete two periods of the study with washout period
      of 7 days between. Each subject during participation in the study will receive a dose of PXS
      5382A orally in a fed state and a fasted state.

      For Part B, repeated oral BID administration of PXS-5382A will be performed in the Fed state
      and dose will be dependent on analysis of Part A.

      In both part A and B PK, PD and safety assessments will be collected.
