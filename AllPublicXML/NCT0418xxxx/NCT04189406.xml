      Rationale: Due to accelerated germ cell loss, infertility is a major problem in girls with
      Turner syndrom (TS). Therefore, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue or oocytes before
      exhaustion of the ovarian reserve may preserve fertility in patients with TS. However, in the
      majority of females with TS , the ovarian reserve is exhausted before the age of menarche.
      Early markers indicating and predicting the ovarian reserve are necessary. During
      mid-childhood the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is quiescent and gonadotropins
      are usually unmeasurable. Nonetheless, this axis is active during infancy. Therefore,
      gonadotropins are measurable with peak values at 3 months of age and with lower (but still
      measurable) values at 9 months of age, in a period called the minipuberty. The aim of this
      study is to find markers of ovarian capacity, during the minipuberty, in order to predict
      ovarian reserve in the future.

      Objective: The hormonal range of LH, FSH, AMH, inhibin B, testosterone and estradiol in girls
      with TS during the minipuberty and the relation of the hormone serum levels with the
      karyotype.

      Study design: A prospective, cohort study with a duration of 3 years. Study population: Girls
      with a pre- or perinatal diagnosis TS who are born in a medical centre in the Netherlands
      during the duration of the study

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Serum levels of FSH, LH, AMH, inhibin B, testosterone and
      estradiol at the age of 3 and 9 months.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      The subjects will have twice an extra venapunction for collection of 3.5mL blood during their
      infancy, which is not stated in the guidelines for TS. There is very little risk for adverse
      events associated with this blood sample collection, however it is an extra procedure. The
      outcome parameters will not be helpful for individual study participants, however they are
      likely to help clinicians and researchers in understanding how the ovarian function operates
      develops? in girls with TS. Furthermore, these markers could be used to estimate the ovarian
      reserve and the urgency of fertility preservation in young females with TS. This information
      could help clinicians, patients and their parents in decision making.

        We include girls with the diagnosis TS before the age of 3 months based on full or partial
        absence of one X-chromosome or a mosaic pattern. We will recruit the girls with TS from all
        medical centres in the Netherlands. The control group consists of girls who have blood
        collected at 3 months and at 9 months of age for another indication. Participants in the
        control group will be recruited in the Radboudumc in Nijmegen.
