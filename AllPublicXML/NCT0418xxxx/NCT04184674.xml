    <textblock>
      Pulmonary distension induced by mechanical ventilation physiologically alters right ventricle
      pre and after-load, hence might lead to right ventricle failure. The hypothesis is that in
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the occurence of a right ventricle failure under lung
      protective ventilation might :

      i) be correlated to the transpulmonary pressure level, ii) lead to global heart failure, iii)
      and extremely result in poor outcome and death.

      The primary objective is to test the impact of transpulmonary pressure on right ventricular
      function in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in adults and children.

      Secondary objectives are :

      i) to compare thresholds of transpulmonary pressure associated with right ventricle failure
      between children and adults.

      ii) to assess if there is an association between transpulmonary pressure and morbidity and
      mortality.

      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory lung injury associated
      with a high pulmonary vascular permeability, leading to acute respiratory failure. Positive
      pressure mechanical ventilation,improves survival but might lead to ventilator-induced lung
      injury (VILI) and right ventricular failure. This hemodynamic effect is more important when
      compliance is decreased, especially in ARDS.

      The use of long protective ventilation (with low tidal volumes and low plateau pressures) has
      improved prognosis of ARDS in adult patients. However, tidal volume and plateau pressures do
      not always reflect the lung deformation and the stress induced by the ventilation; these
      variables depend on the characteristics of the patient's respiratory system. Therefore,
      management focuses on ventilation strategies according to these characteristics.

      Among tools used to evaluate respiratory physiological parameters, the esophageal pressure
      measurement is easily feasible at the bedside, and well estimates pleural pressure and
      pulmonary distension. During invasive ventilation, transpulmonary pressure (PL) can be
      obtained with the difference between the airway pressure and the esophageal pressure.
      Calculation of transpulmonary pressure in ARDS allows optimal ventilator management of adult
      and children treated for ARDS.

      Although individualized ventilation techniques have shown some benefits in ARDS, studies have
      failed to show that survival could be improved by such strategies. This lack of efficacy
      could be partly explained by the hemodynamic impact of ventilation-induced pulmonary
      distension. It therefore seems essential to combine a robust assessment of right ventricular
      function with measurements of transpulmonary pressure in order to know the real hemodynamic
      impact of positive pressure ventilation in ARDS in adults and children.

      The primary objective is to test the impact of transpulmonary pressure on right ventricular
      functionin ARDS adults and children.

      Secondary objectives are :

      i) to compare thresholds of transpulmonary pressure associated to right ventricle failure
      between children and adults ii) to assess if there is an association between transpulmonary
      pressure and morbidity and mortality.

    <time_frame>Three days</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements will be performed at different moments during the respiratory cycle: after an inspiratory pause to evaluate the tele-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure (PL-insp), and after an expiratory pause to evaluate the tele-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (PL-PEP ). The PL-insp will be calculated using the ratio between the elastance of the chest wall (Ecw) and of the respiratory system (Ers) thanks to this formula PL = Paw - Paw x (Ecw/Ers). The PL-exp will be calculated using the ratio between Paw et Pes (PL = Paw - Pes). Transpulmonary pressure will be expressed in cmH2O.</description>

    <description>Correlation between transpulmonary pressure and morbidity. Vaso-Active Inotrope Score is a hemodynamic score taking into account the cumulative doses of inotropic or vassopressive drugs. It is obtained thanks this calculation : VIS = dopamine dose (µg/kg/min) + dobutamine dose (µg/kg/min) + 100 x epinephrine dose (µg/kg/min) + 10 x milrinone dose (µg/kg/min) + 10000 x vasopressin dose (µg/kg/min) + 100 x norepinephrine dose (µg/kg/min). Its value ranges from zero, which is associated to a better outcome, to the maximum cumulative dose without any limit.</description>
