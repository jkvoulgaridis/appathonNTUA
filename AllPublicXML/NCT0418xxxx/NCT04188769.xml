  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of - both constant as intermittent - local
      application of deep pressure on muscle activity and general relaxation in persons with
      hypertonia following stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out in 20 persons with hypertonia following stroke. There will be
      one single test occasion, during which 6 test trials will be performed in random order. Deep
      pressure will be applied by means of a Johnstone air splint, that will be (1) not inflated,
      (2) inflated constantly, or (3) inflated intermittently. Each of these 3 inflation conditions
      will be performed twice, i.e. with and without a non-hemiplegic arm movement (triggering
      hypertonia at hemiplegic side).
