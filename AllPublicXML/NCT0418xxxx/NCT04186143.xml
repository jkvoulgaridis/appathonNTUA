  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous pathology characterized by focal cartilage
      degeneration and the formation of new bone around the subchondral bone and joint, which is
      the disruption of balance between the processes of destruction and repair in subchondral
      area. Knee OA is a considerable cause of disability and is present in 2-3% of all disability
      causes. Exercises are more noticeable than other methods because they are an easy method, low
      cost and long-lasting. To the best of our knowledge, the studies based on this topic are
      scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of open and closed
      kinetic chain exercises on pain, functional level, quality of life and muscle strength in
      patients with knee osteoarthritis.

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous pathology characterized by degeneration of the
      posterior focal cartilage and the formation of new bone around the subchondral bone and
      joint, which is the disruption of the balance between the processes of destruction and repair
      of the joint cartilage and subchondral region. Radiologically, OA was reported in the
      majority of people over 65 years old and in 80% of those over 75 years old. OA is the most
      common joint disease in the world. Knee OA is an important health problem due to pain,
      functional disability and reduced quality of life in patients. Studies have shown that knee
      OA is associated with inadequacy and pain associated with decreased quadriceps muscle
      strength. Strengthening education has been shown to have positive effects on OA.

      Knee OA is a significant disability cause and is present in 3% of all disability causes. OA
      causes disability and consequent labor loss and economic loss. Therefore, OA therapy gains
      importance. OA therapy is classified under three headings as pharmacological methods,
      non-pharmacological methods and surgical methods. In non-pharmacological methods, there are a
      number of studies showing the effectiveness of exercise in particular. Because it is an easy
      method, the cost is low and it is applicable for a long time, the exercises are more
      important than other methods. The literature on exercise programs with optimal gains for knee
      osteoarthritis has not yet been established, with numerous studies reporting the importance
      of different types of exercise for the treatment of knee OA in the literature. Open kinetic
      chain exercises are frequently used to strengthen the quadriceps muscle. Closed kinetic chain
      exercises have been shown to increase muscle strength and improve proprioceptive function by
      activating more muscle spindle and joint proprioceptors. In literature, there are researches
      that compare closed and open kinetic chain exercises. However, these studies mostly focus on
      exercises after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The aim of this study was to
      compare the effects of open and closed kinetic chain exercises on pain, functional level,
      quality of life and muscle strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

    <measure>Visual analogue scale (Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be'. The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing no pain to '10' representing pain as bad as you can imagine or worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>The WOMAC Index (Functional Level)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) was used for functional level of participants. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright; Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day; Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties. The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).</description>

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) (Quality of Life)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) was standardized in 1990 as a self-report measure of functional health and well-being. Version 2.0 was published in 1996 (SF-36v2), with copyright and trademark privileges belonging to the Medical Outcomes Trust, Health Assessment Lab, and QualityMetric Incorporated. The SF-36 was designed to be a brief yet comprehensive measure of general health status. Likert scales and yes/no options are used to assess function and well-being on this 36-item questionnaire. To score the SF-36, scales are standardized with a scoring algorithm or by the SF-36v2 scoring software to obtain a score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better health status, and a mean score of 50 has been articulated as a normative value for all scales. The SF-36 has been translated into more than 40 languages.</description>
