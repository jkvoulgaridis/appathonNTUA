      An Open-Label, Dose Escalation Phase I Clinical Trial on Safety, Tolerability and
      Pharmacokinetics of BAT8001 for Injection in Patients with HER2-Positive Solid Tumors (breast
      cancer or gastric cancer)。

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation Phase I clinical study in two stages. Stage 1 consists
      of the first four cycles where the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity
      of BAT8001 for injections will be studied and preliminary efficacy will be evaluated.
      Efficacy and safety assessments continue from the fifth cycle until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicities.
