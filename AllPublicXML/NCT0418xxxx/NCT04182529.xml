  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well-documented that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated frontal lobe
      dysfunction and executive dysfunction. In addition, many studies reported high level of MCI
      symptoms among the elderly and the trend is increasing in Hong Kong. Based upon the link
      between MCI and frontal and executive function problems, it is conceivable that elderly who
      exhibits high levels of memory problems would exhibit frontal and executive function
      problems. To our knowledge, there is still a lack of effective treatment or therapy for MCI,
      it is important to investigate effective intervention that can efficiently improve the
      cognitive ability of MCI patients or patients with mild memory problems. The objective of the
      present study is to compare individuals with mild memory problems after the Photo
      neuro-modulation Therapy (PNMT) and those who do not. 40 middle aged and older adults were
      recruited from the subject database of the Neuropsychology Laboratory of The Chinese
      University of Hong Kong. Participants were divided randomly and equally into treatment group,
      as well as the placebo group. Several computerized executive function tests will be used
      before and after the treatment under the recording of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),
      which estimates level of frontal activation. It is hypothesized that compared to participants
      without PNMT, those with PNMT will have a better performance in the executive function tasks
      and exhibit a higher frontal activation. The cognitive and neurophysiological results would
      provide evidences on the possibility of PNMT in treating individuals with mild memory
      problems, as well as with other mental disorders.

    <description>In this study low-level LED near-infrared (670-810nm) including MedX Health Model 1100 or WiseFori5-3800 will be used. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this type of device as imposing insignificant risk (FDA-cleared for home treatment, 2005). At each visit, LED clusters will be applied simultaneously for 20 minutes on the Fp1, Fp2 and Pz regions according to the International 10-20 system (Homan, Herman and Purdy, 1987) (energy density, 13 Joules/cm2 [J/cm2] per each LED cluster head placement). The total LED treatment time per visit was 20 minutes.</description>
