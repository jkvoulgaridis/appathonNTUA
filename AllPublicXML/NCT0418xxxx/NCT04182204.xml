    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label study of polatuzumab vedotin administered by
      intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      (R-GemOx) in participants with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
      The study comprises of two stages: a safety run-in stage and a randomized controlled trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety run-in stage (Stage 1) will assess the safety of polatuzumab vedotin plus
      rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (Pola-R-GemOx) in 10 participants. The randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) (Stage 2) will compare Pola-R-GemOx versus R-GemOx in 206
      participants.
