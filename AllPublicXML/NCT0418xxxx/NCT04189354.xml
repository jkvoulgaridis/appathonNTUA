  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxio-depressive disorders are characterized by a difficulty in regulating the negative or
      aversive emotions adequately. These dysfunctions have been linked to a deficit in prefrontal
      cortex activity. The latter has an inhibitory influence on limbic regions -especially the
      amygdala- involved in the generation of emotions. By this means, the prefrontal cortex
      intervenes in the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic
      nervous system whp are responsible for the physiological components of the emotion, including
      the variations of the cardiac rhythm (HRV: heart rate variability).

      In emotionally demanding situations, the activity of the prefrontal cortex is generally
      associated with an increase in parasympathetic activity that is exerted by stimulation of the
      vagus nerve. In patients with anxio-depressive disorder, there is a decrease in the activity
      of the autonomic nervous system whose variability in heart rate is a recognized marker.

      Many studies show a beneficial impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on
      anxio-depressive symptoms, particularly when a particular area is targeted: the dorso-lateral
      prefrontal cortex. The impacts of this intervention are multiple and aim in particular to
      modulate the activity of the autonomic nervous system to promote regulation.

      Biofeedback HRV is a technique that allows you to learn how to modulate your heart rate by
      means of respiratory control exercises. The patient receives an immediate feedback on the
      effectiveness of his learning (basic principle of bio-feedback). This intervention will allow
      to act on the parasympathetic activity and to promote a vagal tone adequate to the emotional
      regulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated the favorable impact of HRV biofeedback on the
      reduction of anxious and depressive symptoms.

      Since the vagus nerve seems to be a primary pathway in physiologically emotional regulation,
      and considering that vagal tone can be stimulated by both the activity of the prefrontal
      cortex and through respiratory control, it appears interesting to study the association of
      t-DCS with HRV biofeedback techniques.

      The first objective of this study is to show that HRV biofeedback training coupled with t-DCS
      is associated with a greater decrease in anxious symptomatology. The secondary objective of
      the study is to show that a coupling of these two techniques is associated with an increase
      of the variability of the cardiac rhythm as well as a more important decrease of the
      depressive symptomatology.
