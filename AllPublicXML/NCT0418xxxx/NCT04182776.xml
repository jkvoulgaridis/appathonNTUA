  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective data will be collected in approximately 420 patients, above the age of 65,
      suffering from an FFP type fracture equal to or higher than type II, according to Rommens and
      Hofmann.

      Patients will be followed up according to the standard (routine) for up to 1 year after the
      treatment. Data collection will include underlying disease, treatment details, functional and
      patient reported outcomes (PRO)s, radiological outcomes, and anticipated or procedure-related
      adverse events (i.e. complications).

      More in detail this registry has the following objectives:

        -  To identify the difference in patient related outcome comparing the surgical and
           conservative treatment in patients suffering from an FFP with different levels of pelvic
           instability at different time points

        -  To compare the rate of complications, morbidity and mortality between the different
           treatment modalities over the whole study period

    <measure>Comorbidities</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Concomitant diseases will be assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). This score assesses the comorbidity level by considering both the number and severity of pre-defined comorbid conditions. It provides a weighted score of a patient's comorbidities which can be used to predict mortality rates. It is a 17-items questionnaire with score range from 0 to 37 points. It estimates the 10-year (or shorter) patient survival.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive status</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The MiniCog is a 3-minute instrument assessing cognitive impairment. It consists of two components, a 3-item recall test for memory and a simply scored clock drawing test. A total score ranges from 0 to 5. A score of zero, one or two out of five points in total, indicates a concern in cognitive functioning.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes: PROMIS Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) Pain Interference (8 questions) assesses the impact of pain on common activities of daily life including social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational aspects. The higher score represents a higher pain level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported outcomes: PROMIS Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Physical Function (10 questions) assesses self-reported capability of physical activities including instrumental activities of daily living. A higher score indicates a better self-reported capability.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - EuroQoL (EQ-5D-3L)</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L has five items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort anxiety/depression) with a three-point categorical response scale level (1 = no problems, 2 = some / moderate problems, 3 = extreme problems) where the patient's current health status is assessed. A unique EQ-5D-3L health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions. The EQ-5D index score ranges from 0 (death) to 1 (best imaginable quality of life), and negative values express &quot;worse than death&quot; state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parker Mobility Score</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>Parker Mobility Scale assess the patient's ability to perform indoor walking, outdoor walking, and shopping before the fracture. A score ranges between 0 and 3 (0 = not at all, 1 = with help from another person, 2 = with an aid, and 3 = no difficulty and no aid) for each function, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 (no walking ability at all) to 9 (fully independent).</description>

    <measure>Modified Barthel index</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel index is an ordinal scale and each performance item is rated on this scale with a given number of points assigned to each level or ranking. It uses 10 variables describing activities of daily living and mobility. A higher number is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence following discharge from hospital.</description>

    <measure>Residential status</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>The residential status will be documented at each visit during 1-year post-treatment phase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-treatment assessment until 12 months after the treatment (surgical or not-surgical)</time_frame>
    <description>Mortality will be assessed for 4 phases:
Perioperative mortality
Within the first 7 days after treatment (early-term)
Within the first 3 months after treatment (mid-term)
Until the last follow up (long-term mortality)</description>

    <description>In this registry, only condition- or treatment-related events (ie complications) will be collected . Partially those events presuppose themselves: eg, re-admission for a surgical revision. In those cases, details on those different events will be collected.</description>
