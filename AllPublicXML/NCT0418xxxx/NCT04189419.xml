      This study consists of two phases (Phase I and Phase IIa). Phase IIa will be conducted
      sequentially after the safety of SCM-AGH is secured in Phase I.

        -  Phase I: Multicenter in Korea, Non-Randomized, Open-label, Single Arm, 3+3 design)

        -  Phase II: Multicenter in Korea, Randomized, Double-blind, 2-arm, Placebo-controlled,
           Parallel arm

      Phase I (Multicenter in Korea, Non-Randomized, Open-label, Single Arm, 3+3 design): Three and
      up to six patients with severe Acute Pancreatitis are planned to recruit from 12 sites in
      Korea, but additional three patients can be enrolled by an assessment of Adverse Drug
      Reaction(ADR) from first three subjects .

      Subjects will be administered with SCM-AGH as an intravenous (IV) infusion once a day for 3
      days. Efficacy and safety are assessed daily for the first week, and then weekly on 3
      occasions (Day 14, 21, and 28). Survival is followed up until Day 90.

      Phase II (Multicenter in Korea, Randomized, Double-blind, 2-arm, Placebo-controlled, Parallel
      arm): Eligible patients will be randomized to the SCM-AGH group or placebo group at 1:1
      ratio. Total 36 patients with severe Acute Pancreatitis are planned to be enrolled from 12
      sites in Korea. Subjects will receive SCM-AGH on Day 0, 1, and 2. Existing standard of care
      is permitted. Efficacy and safety are assessed daily for the first week, and then weekly on 3
      occasions (Day 14, 21, and 28). Survival is followed up until Day 90.
