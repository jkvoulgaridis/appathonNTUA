  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot study to explore the feasibility and efficacy of immunotherapy following
      salvage surgery for recurrent head and neck cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30-40% of patients treated with a curative intent for locally advanced squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck cancer will experience an isolated loco-regional
      recurrence or a second primary tumor in the previously radiated tissues1-5. Patients with
      recurrent head and neck cancer frequently recur locally and are still amenable for curative
      interventions. The current recommendations for treatment of these recurrent and second
      primary tumors includes surgical resection whenever possible as this has been shown to have a
      significantly better outcome as compared to patients treated non-surgically with radiation
      therapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy.

      Immunotherapy is expected to be more effective with smaller amounts of disease and
      application of therapy when disease burden is minimal is expected to yield improved outcomes.
      Many trials underway at the present time explore the use of immunotherapy in earlier stages
      of head and neck cancer than the ones already studied. However, patients undergoing salvage
      therapy are understudied and no major cooperative group or industry trial is addressing this
      group of patients.
