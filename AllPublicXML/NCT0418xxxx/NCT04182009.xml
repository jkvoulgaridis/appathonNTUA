  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sputum induction is considered a relatively non-invasive, reliable procedure, which can be
      utilised to characterise the inflammatory profile of the airways.

      However, the procedure can be slightly uncomfortable for patients. This study aims to assess
      the differences in participants' tolerability of sputum induction, by comparing two different
      nebulisers when performing the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, crossover study to compare the use of two nebulisers in the sputum
      induction procedure. 54 participants with stable asthma or COPD will be recruited and will
      attend 2 visits, at least 48 hours apart. Differences in the quality and quantity of samples
      and the time taken to produce a sample will be described. The main purpose is to explore the
      optimum device to perform the procedure, whilst protecting the safety of participants and
      maximising their comfort.

      If participants are unable to produce a sputum sample after completion of the induction
      procedure, physiotherapy techniques may be performed. This is an exploratory objective to
      establish whether these techniques may help in the event of unsuccessful procedures.
