      Objective: To determine the incidence and characteristics of injuries in elite badminton
      players over a competitive season.

      Design: 12-months prospective cohort study Setting: The French National Institute of Sport,
      Expertise, and Performance (INSEP).

      Participants: Twenty international elite badminton players Independent variables: The type,
      the location, the occurrence of the injury (match or training), the footwork type, the type
      of shot and the perceived fatigue were collected.

      Main Outcome Measures: Injury incidence rates were calculated per 1000 hours of play (Hop).
