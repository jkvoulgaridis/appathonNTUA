  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs; acute cystitis) are very common, with approximately 11
      percentage of women (&gt;18 years of age) reporting at least 1 episode of acute cystitis per
      year. The purpose of this study to evaluate the therapeutic response (combined
      microbiological and clinical efficacy per participant) of oral gepotidacin compared to oral
      nitrofurantoin for acute cystitis in adolescent and adult female participants. In this study,
      participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral gepotidacin or
      oral nitrofurantoin. The study will enroll approximately 1200 participants with uncomplicated
      UTI. The duration of the study will be approximately 28 days with 4 planned study visits.
