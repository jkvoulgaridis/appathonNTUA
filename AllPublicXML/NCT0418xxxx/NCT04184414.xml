  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD19 is expressed in most B malignant tumors, especially in the former B cells ALL. This
      makes CD19 a natural target of immunotherapy. In terms of safety, the lack of B cells caused
      by CD19 targeted therapy will not cause life-threatening side effects (of course, Ig
      supplementation is necessary in the long-term B cell inhibition therapy). Moreover, the
      number of B cells can be restored after removing anti-CD19 treatment measures (such as
      anti-CD19 CART cells). In addition, CD19 has been chosen as the target of B-ALL therapy for
      the following reasons: ① as the BCR signal &quot;amplifier&quot;, CD19 plays a role in PAX-5-mediated
      tumor formation; ② by activating MYC (as the oncogene controlled by PAX-5, C-MYC plays a key
      role in promoting the malignant proliferation of B cells), CD19 can cause B-ALL formation.
      Based on the above reasons, CD19 has become an ideal target in the treatment of B-cell
      cancer.
