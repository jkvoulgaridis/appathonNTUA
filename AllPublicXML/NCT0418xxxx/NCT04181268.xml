  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some data exist about the efficacy and safety of rotational atherectomy, intravascular
      lithotripsy and excimer laser to modify calcified plaques.

      However there is no direct randomized comparison between these three tools in this scenario.

      The aim of this pilot randomized trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of these three
      techniques during PCI of moderate to severe calcified lesions.

      The primary endpoint will be the percentage of stent expansion measured with optical
      coherence tomography. Between secondary endpoints we will analyze the strategy success
      (defined as successful stent delivery and expansion with &lt;20% residual stenosis and TIMI 3
      flow without crossover or stent failure) and presentation of clinical adverse at 1 year
      follow-up .

    <description>The procedure is performed by using a Rotablator system, which consists of a spring coil shaft with a burr at the tip. The front edge of the burr is the ablating portion, oval shaped, and covered with fine diamond crystals.
The rotational atherectomy catheter is introduced into the coronary artery over a dedicated long rotational atherectomy wire, which consists of a monofilament stainless steel 0.09-inch wire.
The device is connected to a console that houses the turbine that rotates the burr with pressurized nitrogen gas. Typically the rpm is set at 150,000 to 180,000 rpm.
After the lesion is crossed with the wire, the lesion is crossed with multiple &quot;pecking&quot; movements of the burr, with each run lasting not more than 20 seconds. After successful rotational atherectomy with one or more burrs, the procedure is completed with balloon angioplasty and stent placement. This can be achieved by exchanging the rota wire with a workhorse wire and using standard equipment.</description>

    <description>The procedure is perforemed with a Coronary intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) System that consists of a generator, a connector cable with a push button to allow manually controlled delivery of electric pulses, and semi-compliant balloon catheter.
The balloon integrates two radiopaque lithotripsy emitters 6 mm that receive electrical pulses from the generator vaporising the fluid within the balloon and creating a rapidly expanding and collapsing bubble. This bubble can transmit unfocused circumferential pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall, in the form of sonic pressure waves equivalent to approximately 50 atmospheres (atm). The IVL therapy consists on a maximun of 8 runs of 10 pulses (80 pulses). The number of therapies needed per lesion will depend on lesion resistance; however, a m√≠nimum of 20 pulses is recommended.
Alter IVL, an optional additional post-dilatation with non-compliant balloons, a stent is implanted</description>

    <arm_group_label>Excimer Laser</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Excimer laser is pulsed gas laser that use Xenon chloride (XeCl) as the active medium to generate pulses of short wavelength, high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light.
Excimer laser tissue ablation is mediated through three distinct mechanisms: photochemical, photo-thermal and photomechanical. UV laser light is absorbed by intra-vascular material and breaks carbon-carbon bonds (photochemical). It elevates the temperature of intra-cellular water, causing cellular rupture and generates a vapor bubble at the catheter tip (photo-thermal). Expansion and implosion of these bubbles disrupts the obstructive intra-vascular material (photomechanical). The laser catheter is advanced slowly over a conventional wire while the therapy is aplied and saline is inffused. After laser, balloon dilatation is usually performed finishing the procedure with stent implantation</description>
