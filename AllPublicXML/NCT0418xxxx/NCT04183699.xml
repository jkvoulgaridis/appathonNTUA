  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, paired-cohort, prospective, controlled study. The patient with a
      suspicion of PCa and a concomitant positive mpMRI (defined as presence of one lesion PI-RADS
      ≥ 3) will receive a MRI-TBx (4 target cores). During the same session, subsequently to
      MRI-TBx, patient will receive a systematic sampling with 6-core S-Bx followed by 14-core
      S-Bx, for a total of 20-core systematic cores, in addition to 4 MRI-TBx cores. Procedure will
      be performed by the same operator. Each single core will be stored in a dedicated cassette
      and sequentially numbered. We hypothesize that the proportion of csPCa (defined as prostate
      cancer with Gleason score ≥ 3+4) detected by 6-cores S-Bx will be no less than that detected
      by 20-cores S-Bx, both performed in addition to MRI-TBx. Assessing the optimal number of
      systematic cores to take in addition to MRI-TBx cores in men undergoing a MRI-TBx would
      provide a useful clinical information for every day clinical practice. Moreover, the
      possibility to decrease the number of systematic cores taken during a MRI-TBx, hence reducing
      the overall number of cores taken during a biopsy, would reduce the length of the diagnostic
      procedure, potentially reduce the probability of infections/sepsis and reduce the
      overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant PCa.
