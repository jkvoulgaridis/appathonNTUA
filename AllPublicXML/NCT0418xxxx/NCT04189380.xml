  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy is a new concept in therapeutic patient education. Health Literacy has been
      defined as the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of
      individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and
      maintain good health. Health literacy seems predictive of adherence 's patients to treatment
      or positive health behavior.

      Liver transplanted patients need to modify their lifestyle and to perform new behaviors in
      order to improve their survival and their quality of life. Health literacy evaluation in
      these patients is necessary to know what they understand and to improve their intake.

      The Aim of the study is to evaluate health literacy among liver transplanted patient and to
      perform liver transplanted patient profiles related to their own health literacy.

      The second aim is to study the impact of health literacy on medication adherence and
      iatrogenic hospitalizations It is a monocentric non-randomized study. During the hepatologist
      consultation, the HLQ Health Literacy Questionnaire is performed to explore patient health
      understanding and perception. Then the pharmacist interviews the patient to explore
      motivations and brakes for their own healthcare; Furthermore, a cognitive and precarity
      evaluation is performed in order to analyze psychological or social factors which can
      influence health literacy.
