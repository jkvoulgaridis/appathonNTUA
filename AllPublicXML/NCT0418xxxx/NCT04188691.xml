  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 450 subjects were enrolled, divided into four age groups, including 18-59 years,
      6-17 years, 3-5 years, and 6-35 months. There are three types of the test vaccine component
      in each age group. A total of 30 people in each dose group were vaccinated with the test
      vaccine or placebo 1 or placebo 2, respectively, in a ratio of 3: 1: 1.

      The 18-59-year-old, 6-17-year-old, and 3-5-year-old age groups were vaccinated 2 times at a
      time interval of 28 days. The 6-35 month age group is divided into two groups, Group 1 is
      inoculated with 2 doses interval of 28 days each, and Group 2 is inoculated with 3 doses
      interval of 28 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January to April 2020, this study was affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, which caused
      the two groups of subjects to vaccinate beyond the window and deviate from the experimental
      plan. After communication between the researcher, the sponsor and the statistician, it was
      decided to restart the Phase I clinical trials of these two groups.
