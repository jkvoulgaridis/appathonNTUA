      The goal of this research study is to understand the effect of inhalation approaches in
      reducing nausea in cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      In this study, inhalation of a study solution will be compared to inhalation of placebo, both
      in the form of preparation pads (a small square of material that contains the solution).
      Isopropyl alcohol may be a part of the preparation pads. A placebo is not a drug. It looks
      like the study solution but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed
      to be compared with the study solution to learn if the study solution has any real effect.

      Inhalation of the study solution may help to control your nausea. Future patients may benefit
      from what is learned. There may be no benefits for you in this study.

      Your participation is completely voluntary. Before choosing to take part in this study, you
      should discuss with the study team any concerns you may have, including side effects,
      potential expenses, and time commitment.

    <description>The mean change in nausea level will be compared between the two arms by two sample t-test. In case there's any violation in the underlying assumptions (e.g. normality, equality of variance, etc.) proper transformation (e.g. logarithm, square root, etc.) or non-parametric methods (Wilcoxon rank sum test) will be applied.</description>
