    <textblock>
      Common neurological indications of intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV)
      include ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, neurotrauma, and intracranial hemorrhage. Mechanical
      ventilation is frequently applied to protect the airway from the risk of aspiration and to
      prevent both hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which are two major systemic factors of secondary
      brain insult.

      Mechanical ventilation after endotracheal intubation predisposes these patients to an
      increased incidence of pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),
      increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, bedsores, increased hospital stay, and poor clinical
      outcome.

      The weaning process from MV involves the reduction of ventilator parameters and Extubation.
      Daily, careful evaluation of clinical and neurological conditions and completion of
      spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be considered in order to recognize and facilitate
      the process of withdrawal of the MV.

      The diaphragm which is the principal respiratory muscle provides nearly 75% of the resting
      pulmonary ventilation. However, In ICU patients, the diaphragm is vulnerable to damage from
      hypotension, hypoxia, and sepsis. Diaphragmatic dysfunction and atrophy is the main
      precipitating factor for difficult and successful weaning.

In addition, these patients received the usual care of MV patients.</description>
