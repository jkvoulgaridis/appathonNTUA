  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains a major health concern and the second highest cause of disability worldwide.
      After experiencing a stroke, many people lose the ability to walk independently. As a result,
      people with stroke require intensive rehabilitation services, spend the majority of their
      time in physical therapy on retraining walking, and cite recovery of walking as a primary
      rehabilitation goal. Assessment of walking using reliable and valid tools is a recommended
      practice in stroke rehabilitation guidelines in Canada, the United States, Australia, and The
      Netherlands. The 10-metre walk test (10mWT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) are highly
      recommended in guidelines and by professional organizations for the clinical evaluation of
      walking across the care continuum. For the 10mWT, the time to traverse the middle 10 metres
      of a 14-metre walkway at a comfortable pace is used to compute comfortable walking speed. For
      the 6MWT, the maximum distance achieved walking back and forth along a 30-metre walkway in
      six minutes is documented.

      To facilitate physical therapists' (PTs') use of an evidence-informed approach to
      administering these walking tests post-stroke in an acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, or
      outpatient rehabilitation setting, the iWalk Toolkit, a theory-based toolkit, was developed.
      This Toolkit consists of an educational guide, a smartphone app, and an educational video.

      In this mixed methods study, PTs across multiple sites were evaluated before and after a
      5-month intervention involving the implementation of the iWalk Toolkit. Objectives of this
      study were: (1) to determine the nature and extent to which PTs across the care continuum
      uptake/use information in a theory-based toolkit designed to guide use of the 10-metre and
      6-minute walk tests post-stroke for initial assessment, goal setting, education, treatment
      selection and monitoring change; and (2) to describe PTs' perceptions of the features of the
      guide, the provider and the setting that facilitated or prevented walk test administration
      and use of test scores for initial assessment, prognosis, goal setting, treatment selection
      and monitoring change.
