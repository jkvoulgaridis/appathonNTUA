    <textblock>
      This qualitative study with quantitative elements examines the health care provided to women
      who suffered from mental disorder during pregnancy and / or in the first year after birth
      (i.e. during the perinatal phase). Investigators will perform individual interviews with
      former PMD patients, and health and social care professionals to gain insights into current
      health care for PMD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Perinatal mental disorders (PMD) are highly prevalent (up to 20%), and patients
      use mental health care at high rates (Berger et al 2018). It is not known if the health care
      for PMD patients meets the needs of the patients.

      Aim: The Investigators will identify factors that promote or hinder service provision and
      access to care, for a range of relevant PMD. The investigation will cover the user and
      provider perspectives.

      Methods: The qualitative study consists of two complementary parts to assess user and
      provider perspectives. In part 1 the Investigators will conduct individual semi-structured
      interviews with 24 women who have had PMD. The sample will comprise of 4 clusters of relevant
      ICD-10 F-diagnoses, covering a wide range of mental disorders. The sample will also comprise
      of participants who received or did not receive mental health care before the last pregnancy.
      In part 2, the Investigators perform 3 focus groups (with 6-8 participants per group) with
      health and social care professionals, and a health-insurance delegate, to collect their
      experiences and perspectives on perinatal health care for PMD patients. The Investigators are
      guided for data collection and analysis by Levesque's et al (2013) conceptual model on access
      to health care.

      Expected results: The study will identify barriers and facilitators for health care access
      (user perspective) and provision (provider perspective). The study will generate the evidence
      base needed to develop integrated, coordinated, patient- and family-centered care for
      patients with various types of PMD.
