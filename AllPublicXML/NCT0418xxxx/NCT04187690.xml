    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jin-shui Huan-xian granule for
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), establish the treatment scheme, and obtain the high
      quality clinical evidences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal
      interstitial lung disease. With worsened dyspnea and an increasing loss of pulmonary
      function, IPF patients will have very poor quality of life. It has also brought an increasing
      social-economic burden. Researches show that pirfenidone and nintedanib could be effective to
      IPF, which were also recommended by the guideline. However, the application has been limited
      by side effects and high prices. It is urgent to develop other effective treatments and
      strategies to manage IPF. The investigators' previous studies shown that Jin-shui Huan-xian
      granule could be effective to IPF.

      This is a multicerter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the
      efficacy of Jin-shui Huan-xian granule in reducinig the acute exacerbations, improving
      exercise capacity, and delaying the disease progression for IPF. After a 2-week wash-out
      period, 312 patients will be randomly assigned into treatment or control group for 52-week
      treatment. The primary outcomes are frequencies of acute exacerbation, 6-minute walking test,
      and percentage of patients with progression-free survival. The secondary outcomes include
      pulmonary function, all-cause mortality, clinical symptoms, dyspnea score, and quality of
      life. Safety will also be evaluated.
