  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance training has been widely recognized as an effective stimulus for increasing
      skeletal muscle size and strength. This study intends to compare the effects of high
      resistance training without blood flow restriction and the low resistance training with blood
      flow restriction training on bicep muscle performance.

      The study is Randomized Control Trail, which is being conducted in RIPHAH COLLEGE OF
      REHABILITATION SCIENCES. Sample size of 40 individual was calculated using Epitool with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) and power 80%. Individual will be screened out according to
      inclusion criteria. Individuals will be allocated randomly into two groups, 20 in high
      resistance training group and 20 in low resistance training with blood flow restriction group
      by sealed envelope method.

      High resistance training will be use in control group.Low resistance with blood flow
      restriction training will be used in experimental group.

      Assessment will be done on baseline 2-4 days prior to the intervention and after 8 weeks of
      training.

      Data will be analyzed on SPSS version 21.

    <description>Total 20 males will participate in this group after warmup , Blood flow restriction will be provided through sphygmomanometer optimum pressure will be measured through following formula occlusion pressure (mmHg) = 0.514 (SBP) + 0.339 (DBP) + 1.461 (Arm circumference) + 17.236 then 30% of 1RM will be used for training . The standard protocol will be used which is four sets (1st set—30 repetitions, 2nd set—15 repetitions, 3rd set—15 repetitions, and 4th set—15 repetitions) with 30-60 s of interval between sets. ( the cuff must be deflated between sets of exercise) for 8 weeks (24) sessions on non-consecutive days. participants will be re-assessed for all baseline variables after 8 weeks of training biceps curls will be used for training.
Heart Rate and oxygen saturation will be measured during the session through Pulse oximeter</description>
