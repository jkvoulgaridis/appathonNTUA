    <textblock>
      The investigators at Washington University will complete a cluster-randomized trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component implementation strategy (the intervention) to
      increase use of the HPV vaccine according to CDC guidelines. The unit of randomization is a
      community-based, primary care pediatric practice. Twenty practices will be randomized into
      two groups, the intervention group (n=10) or a wait-list control group (n=10). The
      intervention will be implemented over 2-years and includes: 1) an educational video for
      providers; 2) audit and feedback of vaccine coverage; 3) a communication strategy; and 4)
      practice facilitation.

      The primary outcome of HPV vaccination by age 13 will be assessed at 24 months, and at 36
      months to assess if change is sustained.
