  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective observational, single-center, multi-intensive care
      unit trial to evaluate the influence of current nutritional practice on the physical outcome
      in critically ill patients. At least 100 consecutive patients requiring surgery, who are
      admitted to any surgical ICU at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen will be recruited.
      Nutritional practices, such as dosage, timing and route of administration of the nutrition,
      as well as complications regarding the nutrition will be recorded and analyzed longitudinally
      from ICU-admission until hospital discharge. Patient outcomes, such as ICU- and hospital
      length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunction, complications and
      infections will be evaluated. To assess physical function of the patient, muscle mass, muscle
      strength, the ability of the patient to self-mobilize and perform every day activities will
      be measured.

      This observational trial aims to assess the current standard of nutritional practice in the
      ICU, to detect problems and complications and to gather first evidences about the influence
      of nutrition on the physical function of the patient. This study also aims to compare the
      outcome of the predefined subgroups of critically ill patients.
