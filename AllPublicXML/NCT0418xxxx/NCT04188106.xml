  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate hydroxyzine, a first-generation antihistamine, combined
      with varenicline, to help smokers abstain from smoking during a 12-week trial period by
      diminishing the nausea, stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbances associated with the use of
      varenicline and with nicotine withdrawal.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) following smoking cessation (while taking arenicline and hydroxyzine).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Stress levels in the last 30 days will be measured using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The PSS-10 uses a 5-point scale (0 - never, 1 = almost never, 2 = once in a while, 3 = often, 4 = very often). Total scores range from 0 to 40.
Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress.
Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress.
Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in anxiety using the 6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Trait and state anxiety levels will be monitored for changes using the 6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). All items are rated on a 4-point scale (&quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be monitored for changes using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 uses a 4-point scale (Not at all = 0; Several days = 1;More than half the days = 2; Nearly every day = 3). The sum of the scores is calculated:
1-4 Minimal depression
5-9 Mild depression
10-14 Moderate depression
15-19 Moderately severe depression
20-27 Severe depression</description>

    <description>Participants enrolled in the study will take the FDA approved starter kit of varenicline for the first week of medication administration (0.5 mg nightly for days 1-3, then 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4-7). During the first week, participants will also receive hydroxyzine dosed in a similar manner, 50 mg nightly for the first 3 days, then twice daily, 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night. After the first week, participants will receive the FDA-approved dose of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) combined with hydroxyzine, 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at nighttime. All medications will be dosed orally.</description>
