      This study will test the feasibility of MedRem, a novel medication reminder and tracking
      system on wearable wrist devices, specifically with the Apple Watch 4. The study team will
      load the MedRem app onto two Apple Watch 4s for use during the study. As the device is placed
      on the wrist, it is free from the limitations of smartphones. However, one of the major
      challenges in developing interactive systems for wrist devices is their form factor. The
      touch screens available on these devices are tiny and much smaller compared to smart phones
      and tablet computers. MedRem enables user interactions by incorporating speech recognition
      and text-to-speech features along with clever interface design. The tiny display of the
      device is used for minimal inputs and outputs, while a user can retrieve and provide more
      information from/to the system through voice commands. Personalized models are built and
      updated over time to reduce errors in recognizing users' voice commands, and thus better user
      experience is provided.
