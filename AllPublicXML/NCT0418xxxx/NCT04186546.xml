      The purpose of this Post-Approval Registry is to gather ongoing safety and effectiveness
      assessment of the Zephyr Valve treatment in a real-world setting.

    <textblock>
      The Zephyr Valve Registry (ZEVR) is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective Registry. The
      objective of this Registry is to provide ongoing safety and effectiveness assessment of the
      Zephyr Valve treatment of patients with hyperinflation associated with severe emphysema, in
      regions of the lung that have little to no collateral ventilation.

      Approximately 150 patients undergoing Zephyr Valve treatment in the commercial setting will
      be enrolled and followed out to 3 years. Assessments will be conducted at 45-days, 6-months,
      12-months, 24-months and 36-months post-procedure. The Zephyr Valve Registry will be
      conducted at a minimum of 5, and a maximum of 10 clinical sites.

      Subjects prescribed Zephyr Valve treatment for their emphysema will be consented and will be
      enrolled only after determination of little to no collateral ventilation between target and
      ipsilateral lobes. Safety and effectiveness of the Zephyr Valve treatment will be evaluated
      post-treatment based on data collected out to 3 years after the treatment.

    <description>BODE stands for Body mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise capacity. The BODE Index is a tool used to predict the death risk by using an algorithm that considers the following variables: body mass index (BMI, B), airflow obstruction (O) as measured by the post-bronchodilator FEV1 (percentage of predicted value), dyspnea (D) assessed by the modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) score, and exercise tolerance (E) measured by 6 minute walking distance. These variables are graded 0 to 3 (0 or 1 for BMI) and summed to give a total score between 0 and 10. The resulting score is called the BODE index, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of death. The mean absolute change in the BODE score will be calculated from baseline scores compared to the BODE score at 6 months and 12 months post procedure.</description>

    <description>The Pulmonx Zephyr Endobronchial Valve is an implantable bronchial valve intended to decrease volume in targeted regions of the lung. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with severe emphysema. The Zephyr Valves are placed in the diseased region of the lung using bronchoscopy. As the diseased region of the lung shrinks in size, healthier regions may expand and function more efficiently, resulting in improved breathing.</description>
