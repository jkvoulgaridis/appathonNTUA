  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1.1. Background: Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for eligible patients with
      end-stage renal disease. It provides better outcomes in terms of life expectancy and quality
      of life than dialysis (Liu, Narins, Maley, Frank, &amp; Lallas, 2012). Kidney transplants from
      living donors also have additional benefits in terms of graft function and survival compared
      to transplants from cadaver donors (Galvani et al., 2012). Living donor transplants provide
      an opportunity to have good quality grafts and to perform the procedure when the recipient is
      in an optimal clinical status (Creta et al., 2019).

      Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was first introduced in 1995 and is currently accepted as the
      gold standard for kidney procurement from living donors. The first worldwide robotic assisted
      laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was performed in 2000 by Horgan et al. (Horgan et al., 2007).

      The main obstacle to living donation is the exposure of a healthy subject to the risks of a
      major surgical intervention. Therefore, efforts have been made to reduce complications and
      postoperative pain, achieve faster recovery, and minimize the surgical incisions.

      Minimally invasive procedures like hand-assisted and robotic approaches greatly enhance
      living donation rates, and in 2001 the number of living donors exceeded the number of cadaver
      donors (Horgan et al., 2007).

      1.2. Aim(s)/Objective(s): The objective of this study is to compare intra- and postoperative
      patient outcomes of kidney donors following hand-assisted and robotic kidney transplants at a
      single center.

      1.3. Rationale for the study: More research is needed regarding the differences between
      minimally invasive approaches to kidney transplantation.

      This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study. Clinical data will be collected from
      electronic medical records (EMRs) on donors and recipients who underwent a minimally invasive
      kidney transplantation procedure. Data from all patients who had a hand-assisted or robotic
      minimally invasive kidney transplantation procedure at Methodist Dallas Medical Center (MDMC)
      between January 2006 and November 2019 will be included in the study.
