  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' objective was to develop a theoretical model exploring the relationship
      between technical errors and adverse patient outcomes. To achieve this aim, the investigators
      interviewed surgeons from a diverse group of surgical specialties, asking them about their
      adverse outcomes from surgery and their most granular surgical techniques. the investigators'
      focus was on adverse outcomes that could be predictably associated with imperfect surgical
      technique and therefore prevented with proper technique.

      Background:

      Minute technical errors performed by the surgeon have the potential to lead to adverse
      patient outcomes. The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of this relationship
      through the development of an intraoperative model.

      Materials and Methods:

      The investigators used Constructivist Grounded Theory methodology, including a comprehensive
      review of the literature and interviews with surgeons, focusing on avoidance of technical
      errors. The investigators used the Observational Clinical Human Reliability Assessment
      system, which categorizes granular, technical intraoperative errors, as their conceptual
      framework. The investigators iteratively interviewed surgeons, from multiple adult and
      pediatric surgical specialties, refined our semi-structured interview, and developed a model.
      The model remained stable after interviewing 11 surgeons, and it was reviewed it with earlier
      interviewed surgeons.
