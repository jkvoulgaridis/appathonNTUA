  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Multifactorial pathogenesis is involved in anemia of cancer patients and defining the
           causes of anemia is not always simple.

        -  Currently, treatment options available for anemia in cancer patients include red blood
           cell (RBC) transfusion, erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA), and iron
           supplementation, accompanying considerable pros and cons for each treatment.

        -  Previous studies have demonstrated benefit when treating with IV iron in combination
           with ESA and, more recently, evidence is emerging to suggest a role for IV iron alone.

        -  In this study, investigator will assess the efficacy of intravenous iron for the
           treatment of anemia in cancer patients.

        -  Improvement of anemia and the improvement of quality of life compared to conservative
           treatment of intravenous iron

      This study is a comparative clinical trial of prospective, multicenter, randomized trials to
      evaluate the efficacy of intravenous iron (Ferinject®) in cancer patients with anemia.

      Changes in hemoglobin in the treated and conservative treatment groups with a single
      intravenous Ferrinject® in patients with anemia by chemotherapy are identified.

        1. Clinical Drug Ferinject Injection For patients undergoing chemotherapy, ferinject 1000mg
           will be injected within 24 hours or 24 hours after day 1 of the next chemotherapy cycle.

           Patients using targeted therapies can be dosed at any time after recognizing Hb
           8.0-10.5g / dL and injecting 1000 mg of ferinject.

             -  The administration of ferinject is a single dose, no re-administration. If
                chemotherapy is not performed, it can be administered at any time if the selection
                and exclusion criteria are met.

             -  The administration period for ferinject should be administered within 24 hours or
                24 hours after the day 1 of the chemotherapy cycle based on the results of phase 2
                studies

        2. remedies Within the period of sample collection of visits 2 to 4 after study enrollment,
           if the physician determines that treatment for clinically meaningful anemia is
           necessary, treatment for anemia other than ferinjects will be followed. Treatment for
           anemia will include remedies such as iron (oral or intravenous), hematopoietic
           accelerators, and blood transfusions, and will be determined by researchers at each
           institution to provide optimal treatment for patients. At the time this treatment is
           administered, the subject will be dropped from the clinical trial.
