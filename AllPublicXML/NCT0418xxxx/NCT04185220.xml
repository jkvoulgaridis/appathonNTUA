  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS) are
      cancers that form in the T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps with the body s
      immune response. A combination of drugs might be able to better treat these cancers than
      existing therapies.

      Objective:

      To test if the drugs IL-15 and mogamulizumab are safe and effective to treat people with ATLL
      or MF/SS.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with relapsed ATLL or MF/SS that has not responded to at least one
      standard treatment

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood (including HIV, hepatitis B and C), urine, lung, and heart tests

      Bone marrow tests (if needed): A needle inserted in the participant s hip will take a small
      amount of marrow.

      CT, PET and/or MRI scans

      Tumor biopsy (if needed): A needle will take out a small piece of the participant s tumor.

      Participants will get the study drugs by vein for up to six 28-day cycles. They will get
      IL-15 the first 5 days of each cycle. They will get mogamulizumab on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of the other cycles. They will be hospitalized for 1 week in cycle
      1. They may need to get a midline catheter. This is a soft tube put into a vein leading to
      the heart.

      Participants will have repeats of the screening tests throughout the study.

      After treatment, participants will have visits every 60 days for 6 months, every 90 days for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      Background:

        -  Advanced mycosis fungoides, its leukemic form Sezary syndrome (MF/SS), and adult T- cell
           leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) are all aggressive mature T-cell malignancies which are
           considered incurable without an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

        -  Mogamulizumab is a defucosylated monoclonal antibody directed towards CCR4, a chemokine
           receptor expressed by the majority of MS/SS and ATLL cells. It is approved by the United
           States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsed MF/SS, and is recommended
           by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for treatment of ATLL.

        -  Defucosylation of mogamulizumab is thought to enhance its capacity for antibody-
           dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells and
           macrophages.

        -  The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory
           cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and
           long- term CD8+ memory T-cells, has been assessed in several phase I trials in cancer
           patients.

        -  Concomitant administration of rhIL-15 with mogamulizumab may further enhance the ADCC
           capacity of the antibody and result in improved efficacy for patients with CCR4-
           expressing cancers.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL-15 administration in combination with standard
      intravenous (IV) mogamulizumab treatment

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed mycosis fungoides/S(SqrRoot)(Copyright)zary
           syndrome or adult T- cell leukemia/lymphoma relapsed after or refractory to at least one
           line of systemic treatment.

        -  Adequate organ and marrow function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase I study

        -  Standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated rhIL-15 with
           fixed dose of mogamulizumab, with an expansion cohort at the MTD

        -  Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycles) of combination therapy

        -  To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, and
           to account for unevaluable patients the accrual ceiling will be set at 20 patients.
