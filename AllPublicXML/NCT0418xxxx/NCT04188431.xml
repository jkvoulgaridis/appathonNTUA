  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical interventions in children.
      However, it is associated with a high incidence of PostOperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV),
      severe pain and haemorrhage.

      There is strong evidence on the efficacy of Dexamethasone in reducing the incidence of PONV
      and pain after tonsillectomy, which led to consider this drug as a first line treatment in
      routine anaesthesia practice in such surgical setting. However, in the last decade, there
      have been arguments about the potential role of Dexamethasone in increasing the risk of
      postoperative bleeding in children and studies addressing the haemorrhage risk following
      administration of Dexamethasone for tonsillectomy are inconclusive.Thus, this study is aimed
      at providing evidence for the safety profile of Dexamethasone with regard to the risk of
      post-tonsillectomy bleeding in children when administered as a single intraoperative dose.

  <detailed_description>

      This double-blind (investigator-surgeon-patient blinded), randomized, placebo control,
      multicentre, international, pragmatic, non-inferiority trial is designed to to provide
      evidence of the Dexamethasone safety profile with regard to the risk of post-tonsillectomy
      bleeding in children when administered as a single intraoperative dose of 0.15mg/kg. The
      study is also aimed at characterizing whether the co-administration of non steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia potentiates the risk of postoperative haemorrhage.

      Sample size estimation is based on the definition of a minimal clinically important
      difference between the 2 groups of treatment (dexamethasone or normal saline) to be equal to
      2% (non-inferiority margin). Thus, 3'794 children in total will be included with 1'897
      children in each treatment group.

      The follow-up will be performed by the parents via an &quot;Application&quot; for Android and Apple
      that has been developed specifically for this study.

    <masking_description>Patients are allocated by block randomisation using sealed envelope system. An external person dedicated by Sponsor is in charge to randomize groups of treatment allocation through a website-generated list and to conceal the lists. Each centre receives the sealed opaque envelopes which contain treatment allocation. The envelope will be opened just before surgery.
A member of the team not involved in the anaesthesia care will open an envelope and prepare the tested medication according to the result of randomization (Dexamethasone or NaCl). The repartition ratio between the 2 arms is 1:1 with a block size of 10.</masking_description>
