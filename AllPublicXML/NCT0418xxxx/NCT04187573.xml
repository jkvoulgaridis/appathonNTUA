  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerus Endovascular is sponsoring a prospective, single arm, multi-center study to document
      the safety and performance of Neqstent in adjunctive therapy.

      The purpose of the study is to document safety and performance of the Neqstent in adjunctive
      therapy in treatment for patients with intracranial aneurysms (IA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neqstent is designed as an adjunctive therapy for patients with unruptured and failed
      bifurcation aneurysm embolizations. Neqstent can be positioned at the neck of the aneurysm
      with or without existing coils and other embolization products. Embolization coils should be
      added to fill the dome of the aneurysm after placement of Neqstent.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient's indication for treatment of unruptured IAs according to the
             national/international guidelines.

          2. Age 18-80 years at screening

          3. Patients who are suitable for non-emergency endovascular embolization of saccular IAs

          4. IA located at a bifurcation in the anterior or posterior circulation with dimensions
             consistent with implant size selection guidelines included in the IFU

          5. Patient has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is willing and able to
             participate in the study for the duration of the study follow-up and is able to comply
             with study requirements

          6. Patient able to able to give their informed consent can be included in this study.
             This must be demonstrated by means of a personally signed and dated informed consent
             document indicating that the subject has been informed of and understood all pertinent
             aspects of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ruptured aneurysm

          2. Patient anatomy or physiology considered unsuitable for endovascular treatment

          3. Any patient anatomy, physiology, existing implants with failed aneurysm embolization
             that would interfere with the ability for Neqstent to seal at the neck of the
             aneurysm. (i.e., compacted coils in close proximity to the neck that prevent good
             apposition of the Neqstent to the wall of the aneurysm, stent and/or stent-like
             devices whose struts span the aneurysm neck to retain the coil mass that inhibit
             access and/or successful Neqstent seating at the aneurysm neck, and/or any aneurysm
             that has a failed device and confirmed thrombus-burden inside the aneurysm sac)

          4. Contraindication for arterial access

          5. Largest measured IA neck diameter &gt;8 mm or &lt;3 mm

          6. Target IA contains other devices/implants (e.g., coils) that will prevent complete
             expansion of Neqstent

          7. Known allergy to platinum, nickel or titanium

          8. Known allergy to contrast agents

          9. Contraindication to anticoagulants or platelet inhibitor medication

         10. Stenosis of the target IA's parent vessel &gt;50%

         11. Anticoagulation medications such as warfarin that cannot be discontinued.

         12. Pregnant, breastfeeding or women of childbearing potential not on adequate birth
             control (only women with a highly effective method of contraception [oral
             contraception or intra-uterine device] or sterile women can be enrolled to the study)

         13. Acute / chronic renal failure (including dialysis); Creatinine &gt; 2.00 mg/dl or &gt; 182
             μmol/L

         14. Myocardial Infarction, Stroke or TIA within the last 6 months

         15. Any other medical issue within the brain that precludes the device implantation such
             as brain surgery, radiation in the target area of intervention, acute traumatic
             craniocerebral injury, etc.

         16. Other medical conditions that cause an inability to comply with study requirements
             and/or that could increase the risk of neurovascular procedures or death within 2
             years (e.g., liver failure, cancer, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease, immunosuppression, neural disease, and hematologic disorders etc.)

         17. Participating in another study with investigational devices or drugs that would
             confound the effects of the study outcomes

         18. The presence of condition that may create unacceptable risk during the aneurysm
             embolization procedure
