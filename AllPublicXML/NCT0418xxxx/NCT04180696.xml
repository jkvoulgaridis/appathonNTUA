  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mid-Q Response study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled,
      interventional, single-blinded, post-market study.

      The purpose of the Mid-Q Response study is to test the hypothesis that the AdaptivCRT (aCRT)
      algorithm is superior to standard CRT therapy regarding patient outcomes in CRT indicated
      patients with moderate QRS duration, preserved atrioventricular (AV) conduction and left
      bundle branch block (LBBB).

      The study will be executed at approximately 55 centers in Asia. The subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the aCRT ON (Adaptive Bi-V and LV) group or the aCRT OFF
      (Nonadaptive CRT) group.

      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that aCRT ON increases the proportion of
      patients that improve on the Clinical Composite Score (CCS) compared to aCRT OFF at 6 months
      of follow-up.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible subjects will be randomized after baseline assessment and implant of a CRT system containing the aCRT algorithm. Randomization will be done in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment (aCRT ON, Adaptive Bi-V and LV) or control (aCRT OFF, Nonadaptive CRT) groups. All subjects, independent of randomization assignment, will have a CRT system.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Clinical Composite Score (CCS) classifies patients according their clinical status at 6 months post-randomization into categories Improved, Unchanged, and Worsened. A patient is classified Worsened in case of death, hospitalization for worsening heart failure, worsened New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (using last observation carried forward), or worsened status on the Global Assessment Score. Also, patients that exit the study or cross over because of worsening heart failure are classified Worsened. A patient is classified Improved when not Worsened and there is an improvement in NYHA class or Global Assessment Score. Patients that are not Worsened or Improved are Unchanged including all patients that miss NYHA class and Global Assessment Score data and are not classified Worsened because of death, HF hospitalization, exit or crossover</description>

    <description>QoL will be measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ); the overall summary score of the KCCQ will be analyzed.
The responses are categorized under 3 subscales (symptom burden, physical limitation and quality of life) with a range of possible subscale scores from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the least burden of symptoms. The total KCCQ score represents the mean of the three subscale scores.</description>
