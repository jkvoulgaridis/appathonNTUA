  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, the number of children's medical services is still far behind the growing demand
      for children's health care. The phenomenon of children's parents queuing overnight for
      registration is no longer surprising. This is because of the increase in the number of
      children and the shortage of pediatric talents. In the department of pediatrics, the number
      of patients increases year by year, but pediatrician is short of supply from beginning to
      end. In addition to outpatient service, pediatricians in large hospitals also perform
      operations, scientific research and other tasks. As a result, many doctors have to give up
      their vacations, which makes them miserable and reduces their enthusiasm for work. The long
      queuing time also reduced the satisfaction of patients, resulting in the intensification of
      the conflict between pediatric doctors and patients.

      This research project aims to create a human-computer integrated system and develop a new
      diagnosis process embedded with artificial intelligence (AI). The function of AI system
      mainly includes 3 aspects. (1) The patient uses a mobile phone application embedded with AI
      that allows him to have check-up before see a doctor. The program will ask the patient a
      number of questions. Then, based on the patient's answers, AI will recommend a series of
      examination, all of which would be reviewed by the physician beforehand. After the patient
      pays for it, he could go straight to do the examination. So, next he could go to the doctor
      with the examination report which saves the patient the trouble of queuing. (2) At the same
      time, the AI system could also automate the medical history. The patient would complete
      self-help history collection in the spare time. The AI system collects the medical history
      and automatically import it to the doctor's computer. Doctors' main job is to modify the
      medical history generated by AI. To some extent, it lightens the burden of doctors. (3)
      During the visit, the AI system automatically captures the information in the patient's
      electronic medical record and generates the possible diagnosis. This process is of great help
      to junior doctors, and may serve as a cue.

      In short, this study is helpful to effectively reduce the waiting time of patients and
      greatly increase their medical experience. While reducing the work intensity of doctors, the
      outpatient procedure of our hospital has been effectively optimized to alleviate the shortage
      of pediatricians to some extent.

    <description>After registration, the patient waits in line at the door of the doctor's office. His doctor uses traditional methods to enter medical records by hand and make diagnosis independently. Then the patient waits in line to pay the bill and queues up for examination. Finally, the patient would take the examination report back to the doctor.</description>

    <description>After registration, the patient binds his information to the mobile phone application through outpatient' number. First, AI system would ask the patient a series of questions. Then it would make a judgment based on the patient's response. The system transmits the examination items to the doctor's computer and, with the doctor's approval, sends items back to the patient. So, patient could go straight to do the examination. While waiting for his turn, the patient enters the phone program again, and the AI system collects his medical history. The information is sent back to the doctor. When the patient goes to the doctor's office with the examination report, the doctor's computer already has his medical records. The doctor only needs to adjust the history according to the actual situation. After writing the medical history, the AI system could automatically make the diagnosis. Doctor uses the AI' results and his own judgment to make a comprehensive diagnosis.</description>
