      The aim of this study is to evaluate the evolution and possible factors associated with the
      persistence of fatigue in patients with quiescent IBD and fatigue included in two previous
      studies.

      Fatigue is a common symptom in inflammatory bowel disease and persists despite clinical
      remission. Fatigue in patients with chronic diseases can be objectified by the FACIT-F scale.

      Recent publications have tried to assess the prevalence and factors related to fatigue in
      patients with IBD.

      In 2017 one study evaluated the prevalence and predictive factors of fatigue in out-patients
      with inflammatory bowel disease. Fatigue was associated with depression, low quality of life
      and female sex. No association was found with micronutrients or levels of interleukins.

      As there are no effective treatments for fatigue in IBD, another study, recently published a
      study evaluating the role of electroacupuncture in 54 patients with quiescent IBD and
      fatigue, observing that both electroacupuncture and sham acupuncture improved fatigue
      compared to the control group.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the evolution and possible factors associated with the
      persistence of fatigue in patients with quiescent IBD and fatigue included in the two
      previous studies.

      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and fatigue (FACIT-F score &lt; 40) included in these
      two previous studies who agree to participate will fill in questionnaires to assess fatigue,
      anxiety, depression and quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease. Moreover, the
      relationship of other biological factors with IBD-related fatigue will be determined.

    <description>Assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F scale). This questionnaire, previously validated in Spanish and for IBD patients, comprises 40 items divided into five subscales: Physical wellbeing (PWB), Social/family wellbeing (SWB), Emotional wellbeing (EWB), Functional Wellbeing (FWB), and Fatigue subscale. The first four subscales (27 items) evaluate general features of chronic illness, and the 13 items of the Fatigue subscale specifically focus on fatigue. Each item has five possible answers, from 0 (very fatigued) to 4 (not at all fatigued). The score of each subscale is the sum of the coded values of its items.</description>

    <description>Assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire. The Spanish validated 21-item version of the BDI will be used to analyze depression. This self-administered questionnaire evaluates the clinical features of melancholy and intrusive thoughts present in depression. Each item has a different number of options (from 4 to 8), which then have to be converted into four possible values (0, 1, 2, or 3). Higher BDI scores indicate a higher grade of depression.</description>

    <description>Assessed by Quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ-9). he IBDQ-9 consists of nine items assessing different aspects of life in IBD patients. Each item has seven different possible answers, scoring from 1 (poorest) to 7 (best). The straight summation of all nine items provides a direct score, which is then transformed into a final score. Higher scores correspond to a better quality of life.</description>
