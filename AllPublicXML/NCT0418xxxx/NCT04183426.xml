  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular disease and associated with risk of
      rupture, but also with a high cardiovascular (CV) event rate. A key difficulty in AAA is
      predicting these life-threatening complications, which are strongly linked to vascular
      health. In 2013, the SMART risk score was developed to calculate the risk of the patients for
      recurrent vascular events based on clinical characteristics. Recently, a novel, easy to
      perform, non-invasive test of endothelial function (the carotid artery reactivity (CAR)
      test), reflecting target organ damage, has been introduced. The CAR is a simple, quick
      (5-min), non-invasive test that uses ultrasound to examine the carotid artery in response to
      sympathetic stimulation by placing one hand in cold water. This test shows strong agreement
      with both coronary and aortic responses to sympathetic stimulation and predicted CV-events in
      patients with peripheral arterial disease.

      The aim of this prospective 2-year follow-up study is to investigate the predictive capacity
      of the CAR-test for development of CV-events after elective AAA repair in comparison to the
      SMART risk score. Secondary objectives are to investigate the predictive capacity of arterial
      stiffness measurements and the post-operative CAR-test for development of CV-events and to
      evaluate health status scores to provide insight if these scores can support clinical
      decision making.

      The investigators will include 192 patients with an AAA who will be scheduled for repair.
      Participants will be recruited from all collaborating hospitals (currently Radboudumc,
      Rijnstate, CWZ) after providing written informed consent.

      In this observational, prospective study, a total of 192 patients who are going to be treated
      for their AAA will be included. Baseline patient characteristics will be registered,
      including traditional risk factors and CV-history. In addition to regular care of measuring
      AAA diameter progression (in mm/year), we will perform the CAR-test (10-min) and non-invasive
      arterial stiffness measures (PWA and PWV) with the SphygmoCor device (10-min).

      Furthermore, the investigators will ask patients to complete a questionnaire about the
      quality of their life. A second questionnaire tries to clarify the disease experience of the
      patients. Both questionnaires will be asked to be completed at the start, 6-8 weeks after
      repair, after one year and after two years of repair. Subsequently, the investigators will
      record major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) according to the International
      Classification of Disease-10. Registration of MACE will be performed using hospital-records
      and following international guidelines. Across a 2-year follow-up, by means of regular
      follow-up appointments, the investigators will examine the ability of the CAR parameter and
      arterial stiffness parameters to predict CV-events.

    <description>The CAR test will be applied to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This thermal stimulus is known to elevate blood pressure via sympathetic pathways, so it can be used to study the vascular response to sympathetic activation. The participant will submerge their left hand in a bucket of ice water (approximately 4 degrees celcius) for 3 minutes, which is reported to be sufficient to induce a maximal dilation in the common carotid artery. At baseline and every minute after the hand is submerged in ice water, the blood pressure will be measured to check whether a sympathetic stimulation is achieved.</description>

    <intervention_name>Arterial Stiffness</intervention_name>
    <description>The SphygmoCor device will be used to non-invasively measure arterial stiffness parameters using applanation tonometry. For Pulse Wave Analyses (PWA), the radial waveform will be recorded. Approximately 10 waveforms are averaged, resulting in several non-invasive parameters:
Peripheral pressure parameters
Central and abdominal aneurysm pressure parameters (derived using a transfer function)
Cardiac output parameters (sub-endocardial viability ratio (SEVR), Ejection Duration (ED))
Pulse wave velocity will be performed by recording the waveforms of the carotid and femoral artery sequentially. The travelled distance will be measured according to the current guidelines and entered in the program. The program will calculate the PWV based on 10 ECG triggered waveform of each artery.</description>
