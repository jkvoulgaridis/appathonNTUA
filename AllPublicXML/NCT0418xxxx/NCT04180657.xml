  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In rodents with protein C deficiency elevated levels of ghrelin has been observed. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate if patients with protein C deficiency also have
      elevated levels of ghrelin, and if so, how this affects the patients.

      30 patients with protein C deficiency and 30 healthy BMI and gender matched controls are
      recruited. Bloodsamples are taken in order to measure ghrelin and GH levels and other
      metabolic parameters. The patients and controls are also asked to answer a questionaire
      regarding appetite.

      If patients with protein C deficiency have higher levels of ghrelin than the general
      population, this will lead to new studies that will perhaps help us understand the importance
      of ghrelin in humans.
