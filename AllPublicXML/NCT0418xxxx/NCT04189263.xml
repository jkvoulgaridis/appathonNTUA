  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a 6-month extreme carbohydrate restricted diet (20
      grams total carbs/day) via phone counseling with dietitian plus aromatase inhibitor therapy
      vs. 6-month control with aromatase inhibitor therapy alone. Visits will occur at screening, 3
      months, and 6 months. Anthropomorphic measurements (such as heart rate, weight, and body
      measurement) and questionnaires will be taken at all three visits. After screening, patients
      will be randomized to receive the carbohydrate restricted diet coaching immediately (Arm A)
      or to a control group (Arm B). Patients randomized to Arm A will receive weekly calls for the
      first 3 months of the intervention, then biweekly calls for the last 3 months of the
      intervention from the study dietitian. Total duration of the study is expected to be 3 years,
      though each patient's participation will be approximately 6 months.
