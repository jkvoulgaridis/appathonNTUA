      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Implementation Facilitation
      (IF) in promoting increased accessibility to methadone treatment.

      This is a Type 3 implementation-effectiveness type study using a modified stepped wedge
      design. The study's purpose is to examine the effectiveness of Implementation Facilitation
      (IF) to prompt participating Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) to utilize interim methadone
      treatment and other approaches to reduce OTP admission delays. Interim methadone treamtent is
      an evidence-based practice permitted under federal OTP regulations to provide methadone
      treatment without routine counseling for individuals requesting methadone treatment who
      otherwise would not be able to be admitted to such treatment within 14 days of request. The
      study will be conducted at six OTPs in the US that are unable to admit individuals within 14
      days of their request for methadone treatment. The OTPs will participate in a baseline
      Pre-Implementation Phase, an Implementation Phase, followed by a Sustainability Phase. OTPs
      will be randomly assigned in groups of two to the order in which they will initiate the
      Implementation Phase. IF will be delivered at the level of the OTP staff and their state
      health department official responsible for OTP oversight. OTP staff and state health
      department officials will be interviewed regarding facilitators and barriers to implementing
      interim methadone and other approaches to reduce admission delays. De-identified data will be
      gathered from the OTPs on the effectiveness of IF in prompting the implementation of interim
      methadone and reducing admission delays.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accessibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Nine months</time_frame>
    <description>Accessibility will be assessed from de-identified OTP records as the proportion of individuals requesting methadone treatment who receive at least one dose of methadone through either interim methadone (IM) or standard methadone within 14 days, divided by the number of individuals requesting methadone treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Nine months</time_frame>
    <description>Uptake will be assessed from de-identified OTP records as the proportion of individuals unable to gain admission within 14 days who receive at least one interim methadone dose divided by the number of individuals who were unable to be admitted within 14 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Nine months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficiency will be assessed from de-identified OTP records as the number of days from the request for OTP admission prior to receiving a first methadone dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Fidelity will be assessed from de-identified OTP records as the proportion of interim methadone patients transferred to standard methadone treatment within the permitted time limit from starting interim methadone treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uptake during the Sustainability Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Sustainability will be assessed from de-identified OTP records as the proportion of interim methadone patients admitted within 14 days of request during the Sustainability Phase</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness: percentage of opioid positive tests</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness will be assessed from de-identified OTP records as the percentage of opioid-positive urine tests of interim methadone patients at the time of transfer to standard methadone treatment</description>
