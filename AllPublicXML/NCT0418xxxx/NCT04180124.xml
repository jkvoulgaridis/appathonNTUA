  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In daily clinic, the use of treadmills to analyze the gait quality of a patient increases.
      The advantages of using a treadmill are that a smaller space is needed compared to a 3D lab
      for motion analysis, more steps can be recorded in shorter time period and patients should
      not start, stop or rotate during the analyses. One of the systems which can be used to
      perform motion analysis on a treadmill is the GRAIL. This GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis
      Interactive Lab) consists of an advanced treadmill with force sensors. Patients can walk on
      this treadmill with an imposed speed (fixed-speed) or at a speed determined by the patient
      itself (self-paced). Because not everyone is used to walk on a treadmill it is important to
      know if a person's walking pattern is different when he walks over ground compared to walking
      on the treadmill. Based on these insights, decisions can be made regarding interventions
      including treadmill training or this findings can be taking into account during further
      analysis of walking patterns on a treadmill. For this study stroke patients would be invited
      for an assessment on the treadmill (1 assessment moment). The movement pattern of these
      patients would be compared in different conditions:

        -  (Forward and backward) Walking at comfortable walking speed on the GAITRite

        -  Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode

        -  Walking at comfortable walking speed +0.2 m/s (faster walking) on the treadmill in fixed
           speed mode

        -  Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in self-paced mode

        -  Backward walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode (only
           if patients are eligible to do so)

      Hypotheses based on this study protocol:

        -  Do stroke patients walk different over ground compared to treadmill walking

        -  Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking self-paced compared to fixed
           speed

        -  Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking fixed speed comfortable
           walking speed compared to fast walking

        -  Is there a correlation between upper extremity impairment and arm swing
