  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficiency of the iPad distraction or the administration of
      Nitrous Oxide on the anxiety decrease when a peripheral venous catheter is needed in children
      between 3 and 9 years old.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aiming at demonstrating the efficacy of active distraction by an iPad on the
      anxiety consequent to venipuncture and insertion of a peripheral vein catheter. The
      comparator is nitrous oxide in a 50% mixture with oxygen that is routinely used for sedation
      during procedural pain. However, nitrous oxide has secondary effects particularly on the
      inhibition of Vitamin B12.

      The primary outcome is anxiety scores. Secondary outcomes are pain scores and satisfaction of
      parents and health providers.

      All children will have EMLA cream (mixture prilocaine and lidocaine) applied one hour prior
      to venous punction. Anxiety, pain and satisfaction scores will be recorded at baseline and
      then within an hour following the venipuncture and insertion of the peripheral vein catheter.
