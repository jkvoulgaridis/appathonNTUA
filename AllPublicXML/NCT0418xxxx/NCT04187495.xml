             agents, radiation, HSCT, or surgery) must be Grade ≤ 1.

          -  Any anti-tumor treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, or immunotherapy wihtin 2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Both men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective
             method of birth control during the study and for six months following the last dose of
             study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

          -  Medical history of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic
             gastrointestinal disease, or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption
             of the tested product.

          -  Previously treated malignancies other than the current disease, except for adequately
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer from which the
             subject has been disease-free for at least 5 years at the trial entry.

          -  Laboratory values not within the Protocol-defined range.

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the trial,
