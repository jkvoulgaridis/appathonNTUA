      This project will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to guide the development of
      optimized treatment strategies for the two most effective smoking cessation medications
      (Combination Nicotine Replacement [C-NRT] and varenicline). The investigators will recruit
      daily smokers from primary care to participate in a fully crossed, 2x2x2x2 factorial
      experiment (N=608) that evaluates 4 different factors: 1) Medication Type (Varenicline vs.
      C-NRT), 2) Preparation Medication (4 Weeks vs. Standard), 3) Medication Duration (Extended
      [24 weeks] vs. Standard [12 weeks]); and 4) Counseling Modality (three, 15-20 minute sessions
      conducted In-Person vs. Phone). Participants will complete baseline assessments and then
      assessments of smoking status, treatment use, side effects, potential treatment mechanisms
      (e.g., withdrawal, self-efficacy) at Weeks 6, 12, 26 and 52 and Months 18 and 24 post-target
      quit day. These data will be used to examine the main and interactive effects of these four
      factors on various outcomes, with biochemically confirmed 12-month abstinence serving as the
      primary outcome. These data will also be used to determine which factors and combinations of
      factors are most effective with regard to 12-month biochemically confirmed abstinence and
      cost, thereby identifying optimized varenicline and C-NRT treatments, with each developed to
      yield especially great benefit. These optimized treatments will then be tested in the
      Optimized Care Project. The investigators will also examine the relative effects of each
      medication on particular outcomes (e.g., 12-month abstinence).

      Design and Objective: The Cessation Screening Project is a 4-factor factorial screening
      experiment (i.e., 2x2x2x2 = 16 experimental conditions) designed to identify the most
      promising intervention components that are especially effective and cost-effective with
      regard to their main and interactive effects on 12-month biochemically verified abstinence.
      This design will allow us to: 1) detect main effects and interactions within the factorial
      experiment and identify especially effective regimens for varenicline and for (Combination
      Nicotine Replacement) C-NRT; 2) compare the relative effectiveness of varenicline and C-NRT;
      and 3) identify the most effective and cost-effective counseling modality to use with the
      optimized medication regimens. Finally, these results will allow us to identify two optimized
      treatment packages for use with primary care smokers interested in quitting: packages that
      include both counseling and pharmacotherapies optimized on the bases of effectiveness and
      cost. The optimized varenicline-based and C-NRT-based packages will then be evaluated
      relative to Usual Care in a randomized clinical trial in the Optimized Care Project.

      Recruitment and Participants: Participants (N=608) will be primary care patients from 8
      clinics with on-site pharmacies in two Wisconsin healthcare systems. Smokers will be
      identified via the healthcare system electronic health record (EHR). All EHR-identified
      smokers in a clinic will receive a mailed invitation to find out more about smoking treatment
      by calling a healthcare system Care Manager (CM). In addition, using an opt-out strategy,
      Medical Assistants (MAs), using an EHR-guided prompt, will inform all identified smokers
      attending primary care clinic visits that they will be contacted within 2 working days by the
      CM unless the participant indicates s/he wants to opt-out. The participant contact
      information will then be automatically sent to the CM unless the participant opts out; the
      investigators have developed and used this workflow successfully in their past research. The
      CM will call and screen participants and offer interested, eligible patients an opportunity
      to participate in this smoking cessation study. The CM will then use the research database to
      schedule the participant's initial visit with research staff that will occur at the
      participant's primary care clinic. As soon as the CM schedules the participant for his/her
      first visit, the CM will notify the participant's primary care provider (PCP), via EHR
      messaging, that the participant has volunteered for a study with C-NRT or varenicline. The
      PCP will notify the CM (via a 1-click EHR link) that the participant is medically eligible to
      receive either cessation medication prior to the initial study visit, as required by the
      collaborating healthcare systems. This will occur within 5 business days. At this initial
      study visit, potential participants will undergo a final eligibility screening and provide
      written informed consent. Participants not interested in quitting will be invited to
      participate in the separate System Changes Screening Project; those interested in quitting
      but not eligible for the Cessation Screening Project will be electronically referred to the
      Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL). Therefore, all smokers will be offered access to
      evidence-based cessation treatment, either as part of the Cessation Screening Project or
      through referrals to the WTQL or to their primary care provider.

      Procedures and Measures: At the first study visit, phone-screened participants will provide
      written informed consent, complete a brief assessment, and provide a breath sample for CO
      assessment. Participants will then be randomized by research staff, stratified by clinic,
      gender, and race [White vs. Non-white], to one level of each of four factors: 1) Medication
      Type (Varenicline vs. C-NRT), 2) Preparation Medication (4 weeks vs. Standard), 3) Medication
      Duration (Extended [24 weeks] vs. Standard [12 weeks]), and 4) Counseling Modality (In-Person
      vs. Phone). Participants will then be told their treatment condition, set a target quit date
      (TQD), and receive a handout that details their treatment and all appointments. The handout
      will describe: 1) when to begin taking study medication; 2) the type and doses involved; 3)
      how and when to obtain the next month's medication; and 4) complete instructions on proper
      medication use, including information from the package insert and contact information if they
      want to ask questions regarding their medication, and/or symptoms they experience.
      Participants will pick up their study medication from the on-site clinic pharmacy.
      Participants will receive one month of study medication at a time and will need to pick up
      refills monthly (for 2 or 5 more months, depending on the treatment condition) from their
      on-site clinic pharmacy. Participants randomized to receive in-person counseling will also
      have their prequit counseling session during Visit 1; those assigned to phone counseling will
      schedule their first counseling call at Visit 1. Participants will complete phone assessments
      at post-TQD Weeks 6, 12, 26, 40 and 52 and then 18 and 24 months.

      Outcomes and Analyses: The primary outcome for this study is biochemically confirmed,
      point-prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-TQD (Primary Aim 1). A 12-month follow-up is
      crucial since some conditions will receive treatment for up to 6 months and ascertaining the
      persistence of abstinence in the extended treatment conditions is vital. The investigators
      will also examine cost and cost-effectiveness of different treatment conditions. To address
      effectiveness, logistic regression analyses with predictors corresponding to the four factors
      defined using effect coding will be conducted. Main effects will reflect the degree to which
      the &quot;ON&quot; conditions produce significant increases in 1-year point-prevalence abstinence,
      relative to the &quot;OFF&quot; conditions for each factor, when averaged across the other factors.
      Cost-effectiveness of intervention components and combinations of components will be
      evaluated using methods recommended by the United States Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in
      Health and Medicine. Investigators will compute the cost/quit using the healthcare system
      perspective to establish costs.

      To identify the optimized varenicline-based treatment and C-NRT-based treatment (Primary Aim
      2), the investigators, in collaboration with investigators from the Optimization and Analysis
      Cores of the P01 center grant funding this study, will use multiple criteria decision
      analysis to select especially effective component packages to constitute &quot;optimized&quot;
      treatments (i.e., to develop a treatment with strong effectiveness at relatively low cost).
      Specifically, the primary optimization process will use abstinence at 12 months post-TQD and
      cost as the optimization criteria. Consistent with the recommendations of the International
      Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Best Practices Task Force with
      respect to problem definition, criteria selection, use of the value measurement approach,
      criteria weighting, sensitivity analyses, and so on will be followed. The investigators will
      synthesize cost and effectiveness scores for groupings of intervention components via an
      additive model with weights for the scores being derived from data generated by assessments
      of key healthcare system and clinical stakeholders (e.g., physicians, healthcare system
      administrators). The optimized packages will be those that perform best with regard to
      stakeholder-based preference weightings. These packages will ultimately be compared to
      Standard Care in the Optimized Care Project (a separate study in the P01 center grant) on the
      bases of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in primary care.
