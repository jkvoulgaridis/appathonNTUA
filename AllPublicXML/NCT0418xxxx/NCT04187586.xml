  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No study has investigated the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) on
      hypertrophic scar characteristics. Thus, this study aimed to ascertain the effects ESWT on
      burn scars. The investigators retrospectively reviewed burn patients who had undergone
      autologous split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) with same artificial dermis between January
      2012 and September 2019.

      No study has investigated the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) on
      hypertrophic scar characteristics. Thus, this study aimed to ascertain the effects ESWT on
      burn scars. The investigators retrospectively reviewed burn patients who had undergone
      autologous split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) with same artificial dermis between January
      2012 and September 2019. The ESWT group (n=17) received shock waves with low-energy flux
      density (0.05-0.30 mJ/mm2). The interval between treatments is a 1-week. The ESWT group also
      received standard treatment. The control group (n=18) only received standard treatment. We
      reviewed skin characteristics before and after 6 treatment sessions for both groups. The
      investigators checked skin charateristics(erythema, transepidermal water loss, sebum level,
      and elasticity). The investigators expect that ESWT is effective for significantly improving
      burn-associated scar characteristics and may be used for managing burn patients.

    <description>TEWL measured with a Tewameter® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany), which is used for evaluating water evaporation. The higher values indicating a skin dryness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sebum</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sebum in the scars was measured with the Sebumeter® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany). The measurement is based on the principle of grease-spot photometry using a cassette with its special tape. A microprocessor calculates the result, which is shown on the display in mg/cm2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Elasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Elasticity was measured using Cutometer SEM 580® (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany), which applies negative pressure (450 mbar) on the skin. The numeric values (mm) of the skin's distortion is presented as the elasticity. Two seconds of negative pressure of 450 mbar is followed by 2 s of recess, and this consists of a complete cycle. Three measurement cycles were conducted, and the average values were obtained. The higher values present the higher elasticity.</description>

    <description>The ESWT group received shock waves with low-energy flux density (0.05-0.30 mJ/mm2). The interval between treatments is a 1-week. To evaluate the effect of ESWT, we reviewed the skin test results (thickness, melanin, erythema, TEWL, sebum, and skin elasticity levels) immediately before ESWT and immediately after the sixth session. And also the ESWT group received the standard treatment, which involved medication, scar lubrication, burn rehabilitation massage therapy, and physical therapy.</description>
