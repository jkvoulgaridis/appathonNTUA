      This Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      identify the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of a repeated-dose regimen of DPI 386
      nasal gel (intranasal scopolamine gel) for the prevention and treatment of nausea associated
      with motion sickness. The study will have three arms: DPI-386 nasal gel, placebo nasal gel,
      and TDS patch (1.5 mg/72 hours), the current standard of care for the treatment of motion
      sickness. The study will include 34 subjects per arm, for a total of 102 subjects (n=102). A
      double dummy design will be used to mask the treatment assignment. All subjects will receive
      both a patch and nasal gel randomized to one of the following three arms: DPI-386 Nasal Gel +
      placebo patch, placebo nasal gel + placebo patch, or placebo nasal gel + TDS patch.

      Treatment Day 1 will be conducted aboard an ocean-going vessel to obtain data in an
      operationally relevant real world environment immediately followed by Treatment Days 2 and 3
      at a clinical site or one of its two satellite locations.

    <masking_description>study is double-blinded placebo controlled for all treatment arms. All DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo nasal gel vials are opaque and indistinguishable. The DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo nasal gels are identical in color and viscosity, and without identifiable smell. Each placebo patch is similar in color and size as the TDS patch but does not deliver any medication or contain any excipients. A designated independent (unblinded) applicator will administer all patch application and removal, including an opaque waterproof bandage cover over the patch, to further prevent unblinding.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>During the 8 hour voyage on Treatment Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS - Respondents specify their degree of nausea by indicating a point along a continuous 100 mm line between two end-points; left one is for &quot;No nausea&quot; and the right one for &quot;Very severe nausea&quot;. Scoring is based on the length from left point and a higher score means more severe degree of nausea (Spinks &amp; Wasiak, 2011).</description>

    <measure>Severity of motion sickness as measured by the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) over the treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 8 hour voyage on Treatment Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>MSAQ - The MSAQ was designed to measure motion sickness as a multi-dimensional construct, with the understanding that when an individual states they are experiencing motion sickness, it is unlikely a single symptom, but rather a complex set of symptoms, with varying levels of severity. Sixteen symptoms are listed, with symptoms differentiated along four dimensions: gastrointestinal, central, peripheral, and sopite-related. Each symptom is scored from 1 to 9 in severity and scores then calculated. All 16 items were collected from the general public instead of experts, allowing for a more accurate wording of the symptomology experienced by persons outside of physiological sciences. The MSAQ has been repeatedly validated and is strongly correlated with both the Pensacola Diagnostic index (r = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001) and the Nausea Profile (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001).</description>
