      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Libicare® in the sexual desire
      and arousal at 12 weeks in peri or postmenopausal women aged between 40 and 60 years old with
      low sexual desire and arousal compared with active control.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Libicare® in the sexual desire
      and arousal at 12 weeks in peri or postmenopausal women aged between 40 and 60 years old with
      low sexual desire and arousal compared with active control.

      Despite current consensus in the literature that Female Sexual Dysfunction can manifest at
      any age in a woman´s life, researchers as Sarrel documented that during menopause, up to 40%
      of women are experiencing a decrease in their sexual libido. The common assumption is that
      the menopause contributes to a drop of the sexual desire probably as a result of low
      production of hormones from ovaries, at the same time will reduce the estrogen and
      testosterone. This reduction starts to be reduced in the thirties and continues to reduce
      progressively at a constant rate reaching of about 50% of their initial highest levels by the
      time they reach menopause. Other hormones could be involved as Sex hormone-binding globulin
      (SHBG) or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), both are related with testosterone levels.

      Libicare® is a dietary supplement whose ingredients could have positive effects on the
      improvement of sexual function in women with low desire and arousal levels.

    <intervention_model_description>The selected patients will be randomly distributed in one of the two arms (Libicare® / active-control), in a 2:1 ratio according to a randomization list. The kits containing the study treatment (Libicare®) and the active-control will be numbered with a randomization code according to this unique list and will be distributed to the consultations.
Patients will not know the treatment and only the researchers and team investigator assigned to the study will know the treatment assigned.
A second randomization list (ratio 1:1) will be generated for Libicare® responding patients, at 12 weeks in order to assign two sub-groups: continue Libicare® treatment or observation without Libicare® treatment.</intervention_model_description>

Responding patients: this population, defined by FSFI score &gt; 26.55, will be randomized (1:1) into 2 groups: one of them will take Libicare® for further 12 weeks (total period on treatment: 24 weeks) and the other group will remain under observation with no treatment for further 12 weeks (total period on treatment: 12 weeks).
Non-responding patients: this population, defined by FSFI score ≤ 26.55, will intake Libicare® for further 12 weeks (total period on treatment: 24 weeks).</description>
