  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHO-PEN@Scale project is a three-arm cluster-randomized trial that is investigating the
      population-level effects of a healthcare reform in Eswatini, which aims to strengthen primary
      care for diabetes and hypertension. Prior to the reform, healthcare for diabetes and
      hypertension was mostly provided through physician-led teams in hospital outpatient
      departments. The healthcare reform aims to strengthen the provision of nurse-led care for
      diabetes and hypertension in primary healthcare facilities and community health worker-led
      care for these conditions in the facilities' catchment areas. The reform will broadly be
      guided by the World Health Organization's &quot;Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease
      Interventions for Primary Health Care in Low-Resource Settings&quot; (WHO-PEN). The trial will
      take place at 84 clusters (a primary healthcare facility and its catchment area) across the
      country.

The intervention will broadly follow the disease screening, management, and referral protocols detailed in the WHO-PEN guidelines and adapted for the Eswatini context during a feasibility pilot.</description>

    <description>This arm consists of all activities of arm 2 (the &quot;PEN arm&quot;) plus additional responsibilities for community health workers who are affiliated with the given healthcare facility through the public-sector health system structure. Specifically, community health workers will i) conduct household visits to refer adults aged 40 years and older who have not been screened for diabetes and hypertension in the past 12 months to the primary healthcare facility with which the community health worker is affiliated, ii) provide counseling on reducing one's risk of cardiovascular disease during these home visits, iii) follow up with individuals whom they referred to a healthcare facility at their home, and iv) provide information on primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease at community meetings.</description>
