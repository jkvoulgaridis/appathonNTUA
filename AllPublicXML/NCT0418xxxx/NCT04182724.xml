  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II , Open-label , Investigator-initiated Trail of Camrelizumab (an
      Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor), Apatinib (VEGFR2 Inhibitor) and Nab-paclitaxel as Second-line Treatment
      in Advanced Gastric Cancer The study was designed in two stages, the first stage was the
      tolerance observation stage, and the second stage was the curative effect expansion stage.

      The first part of the study is the Dose-finding Phase designed to establish the safety of
      Camrelizumab, Apatinib and Nab-paclitaxel at different dose Levels(125 mg/m2, iv. q2w, 150
      mg/m2, iv. q2w, 175 mg/m2, iv. q2w or 200 mg/m2, iv. q2w). The second part of the study is
      the Expansion Phase designed to generate additional clinical data at specified doses .

      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab, Apatinib and
      Nab-paclitaxel in the Second-line treatment of advanced Gastric Cancer.
