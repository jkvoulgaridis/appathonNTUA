    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the benefits and harms of goal directed fluid removal with furosemide
      versus placebo in critical ill adult patients with fluid overload in the intensive care unit.
      Half of the patients will receive furosemide and the other half placebo. The treatment will
      continue until the excess fluid is excreted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid overload is a common and serious complication in patients admitted to the intensive
      care unit (ICU). A core element of therapy in the ICU is resuscitation with crystalloid
      solutions. In many cases fluid accumulate, and patients become fluid overloaded. Several
      observational studies indicate a detrimental effect of fluid overload in different clinical
      settings, including patients with acute kidney injury. It is unknown whether this association
      is causal or if the increased tendency to accumulate fluid is a marker of disease severity
      and thereby a higher risk of death. The investigators want to investigate this in critical
      ill patients with fluid overload of 5% or more by randomizing them to furosemide (diuretics)
      or placebo.

These value sets reflect the preferences of the general population. The European quality of life visual analogue scale is a self-reported assessment of the participant's health status. Scores on 100 = the best health you can imagine and 0 = the worst health you can imagine.</description>

    <description>40 mg (4 ml) of furosemide iv. followed by infusion of furosemide. Infusion rate: 0-40 mg/hour. Starting rate: 20 mg/hour. The infusion is adjusted according effect. Target is a negative fluid balance of 1 ml/kg/hour. The fluid balance is calculated 3 times a dag at 6:00 am, 2:00 pm and 10:00 pm. Goal directed fluid removal is stopped when the fluid balance is +/- 750 ml.</description>

             fluid strategy.

          -  Severe hepatic failure as per the clinical team.

          -  Patients undergoing forced treatment.
