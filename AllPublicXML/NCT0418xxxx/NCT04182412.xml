  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether abdominal wall reconstruction through
      laparoscopic surgery can be recommended as a safe treatment alternative for patients with
      symptomatic rectus diastasis, and if this type of treatment leads to improved quality of
      life, trunk stability and reduced pain.

      Investigate whether surgical reconstruction with laparoscopic technique can lead to improved
      quality of Life, trunk stability and reduced pain in patients with symptomatic rectus
      diastasis. The study will also compare two different laparoscopic surgery methods for
      abdominal wall reconstruction: narrowing of linea alba with continuous suture with or without
      mesh.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND-36 It is comprised of 36 items that assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perceptions. Physical and mental health summary scores are also derived from the eight RAND-36 scales. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>VHPQ is a questionnaire for the assessment of pre- and postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire comprises 20 questions The first six questions concern the level and duration of pain. The next seven questionsrelate to the impact on daily activities. The final questions deal with patient satisfaction and how physically demanding the patients regard their occupation. Pain intensity in the VHPQ is assessed using a 7-step fixed-point rating scale with steps linked to pain behavior rather than numbers or verbal descriptors of pain. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
