      This is a single arm phase II clinical trial. Patients will receive a standard conditioning
      regimen with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Flu/Cy/TBI) prior to
      haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In addition the pre-transplant
      conditioning will include targeted total marrow irradiation (TMI) at a dose of 6Gy.
      Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis will include cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on Day +3 and 4
      along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient age 18-75 years

          2. Related donor who is, at minimum, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haploidentical. The
             donor and recipient must be identical at least one allele of each of the following
             genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1. A minimum match of 5/10 is
             therefore required, and will be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and
             recipient share one HLA haplotype. In addition, unrelated donors who are mismatched at
             least one of the following loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-or DRB1.

          3. Eligible diagnoses are listed below. Patient must have one of the following:

               1. Relapsed or refractory acute leukemia (including AML or ALL in CR2 and primary
