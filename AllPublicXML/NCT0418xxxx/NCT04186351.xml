  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the value of the automated notification service that allows more timely
      information access and sharing. A 12-month RCT will be conducted to determine the efficacy of
      the provision of the service to an elderly care and service provider in improving care and
      health outcomes of the elderly. Researchers will also examine whether the notification
      service will better support the carers for the coordination and prioritization of care and
      service delivery.

      A research team at the University of Hong Kong is commissioned to conduct a study of the
      efficacy of providing an automated notification service, i.e., the &quot;Encounter Notification
      Service,&quot; via the Electronic Health Record Sharing System (eHRSS) to an elderly caring and
      service provider that aims to facilitate more timely provision and coordination of healthcare
      services for home-dwelling elderly. With the access to the automated notification service
      containing up-to-date encounter information of the elderly in the eHRSS (e.g. discharge date
      from the public hospital, outpatient appointments), it is expected that the elderly caring
      and service provider can improve its allocation of resources and prioritize the provision of
      service to elderly patients who are in need, i.e., during the transition of care. As a
      result, the caring support and services provided by the elderly caring and service provider
      to the elderly can be more timely and effective, and an improvement in patient health
      outcomes can be expected.

      To obtain evidence to determine the value of the automated notification service, a systematic
      study of the efficacy is suggested. Thus, researchers set out to conduct a 12-month
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine whether the provision of the automated
      notification service to the caring and service provider will result in improvements in care
      and health outcomes of the elderly. Also, researchers will assess whether the notification
      service will better support the carers for the coordination and prioritization of care and
      service provision and improve workflow and administrative procedures amongst different
      sectors.

      In this pilot study, the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA) is the participated
      elderly caring and service provider.
