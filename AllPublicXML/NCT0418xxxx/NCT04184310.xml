      from December 2016 to July 2019, 36 elderly co-morbid patients with rectal prolapse were
      involved in this study which is performed in the GIT surgery unit of Zagazig University
      Hospital. the investigators used a modified linear stapler resection technique for the rectal
      prolapse. Postoperative follow up was done for one year to evaluate functional outcome,
      operative time, hospital stay and complications

      The study was done in the GIT Unit of the General Surgery Department of Zagazig University
      Hospital in the period from December 2016 to July 2019. The hospital Institutional Review
      Board approved the study protocol. Thirty-six old, co-morbid and short life expectancy
      patients were included in the sample. They were evaluated for PSP. Informed consent was
      signed by all patients or first-degree relatives after full discussion of the advantage and
      disadvantage of the operation. Preoperative bimanual examination was done for rectal prolapse
      to rule out enterocele or cystocele and this was confirmed by MRI. The routine preoperative
      evaluation was done for all patients (physical examination, complete blood tests, ECG and
      chest x-ray). Bowel preparation was done for all patients.

      Regarding bowel function, all patients were evaluated for fecal incontinence by Wexner score
      and for constipation by Rome II criteria. Prophylactic intravenous cephalosporin and
      metronidazole was given one hour before operation. The operation was done under spinal
      anesthesia in the lithotomy position with slight Trendeleburg to prevent trapping of
      abdominal organs between walls of rectum. All operations were done by the same surgical
      members of the unit. Hospital stay, Intraoperative and postoperative complications were
      recorded. All patients started oral fluids in the second day. Follow up was done for patients
      every 1,3,6,9 and 12 months in the outpatient clinic.

    <description>After anesthesia and patient position, the prolapse was pulled out Two vertical incision were made in both the inner and outer walls of the prolapse (at 3and 9 o'clock)1-2 cm in size approximately 2 cm above the dentate line. We used a reloadable linear cutter stapler (GIA 100mm Covidien, Mansfield, Mass., USA) passing through the tunnel to cut the anterior aspect of the prolapse . Then, after reload the stapler by the new cartridge, we used it to do the same for posterior wall and the prolapsed rectum was completely transected . We ensure that the stapler did not fire at the dentate line to avoid post-operative pain. Multiple 3-0 PDS intermittent full thickness sutures were done for hemostasis. The prolapsed rectum falls back into place spontaneously.</description>
