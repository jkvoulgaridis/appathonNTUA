  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is able to exert long lasting effects in children with atopic
      disorders. Nutramigen LGG accelerates tolerance acquisition in infants with cow's milk
      allergy. The mechanisms of these effects are still largely undefined. The effect of LGG could
      be related at least in part by the immunoregulatory role played by LGG. This probiotic can
      balance the generation of cytokines possibly involved in IgE- or non-IgE-mediated cow's milk
      allergy Interleulkin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-γ , TGF-β, and TNF-Υ), which can contribute to
      modulation of inflammatory processes. The investigators have demonstrated that children with
      IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly higher level of IL-4 and IL-13 in response to cow's
      milk protein, and that tolerance is associated with a marked reduction of IL-13 production
      and a concomitant increased frequency of IFN-γ releasing cells. Epigenetics studies the
      heritable (and potentially reversible) changes of the genome inherited from one cell
      generation to the next which alter gene expression but do not involve changes in primary DNA
      sequences, highlighting the complexity of the inter-relationship between genetics and
      nutrition. There are three distinct, but closely interacting, epigenetic mechanisms (histone
      acetylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding microRNAs) that are responsible for modifying
      the expression of critical genes associated with physiologic and pathologic processes. The
      profile of epigenetic modifications associated with Th lineage commitment, coupled with the
      sensitivity of the early developmental period, has led to speculation that factors that
      disrupt these pathways may increase the risk of allergic diseases. Specifically, effects on
      DNA methylation and endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitors acting on specific pathways
      (Th1 and T regulatory cell differentiation) may favour Th2-associated allergic
      differentiation. MicroRNAs are another structural components of an epigenetic mechanism of
      post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA translation. It has been recently identified
      a specific Th2-associated microRNA (miR-21) that is critical for the regulation of Th cell
      polarization. It has been previously demonstrated an inverse DNA methylation pattern of
      cytokines involved in Th2 response (IL-4, IL-5) compared with cytokines involved in Th1
      response (IL-10, INF- y) in children with CMA acquiring oral tolerance, with the most
      pronounced effects in those treated with Nutramigen LGG.
