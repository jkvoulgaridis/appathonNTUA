      This is an open-label, historically controlled pilot study investigating the immune effect of
      Laser Interstitial ThermotHerapy (LITT)+ pembrolizumab in adult patients with a primary
      cancer approved by the FDA for treatment with an immune-checkpoint inhibitor who have
      recurrent brain metastasis after prior stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

      Adult patients with a primary cancer approved by the FDA for treatment with an
      immune-checkpoint inhibitor who have recurrent brain metastasis that have failed stereotactic
      radiosurgery treatment will be screened. They will sign consent and complete screening
      procedures. Each patient will be scheduled to undergo biopsy and LITT treatment. Within two
      weeks of surgery, patients will begin receiving pembrolizumab every three weeks.
      Pembrolizumab infusions will continue until brain met recurrence per RANO for Brain Mets or
      up to two years, whichever comes first. Blood samples will be collected for immune
      monitoring. Tumor tissue will be collected for immune and genomic studies. Approximately 21
      patients will be enrolled to accrue 15 evaluable subjects. Patients will be followed for
      survival data for one year or until death, whichever comes first.

             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 24 weeks after
             the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. Prior to study
             enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of
             avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an

          2. History of immunodeficiency or is receiving any form of immunosuppressive therapy
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment (with the exception of daily
             dexamethasone ≤ 6 mg).

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active

             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          5. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis.

          6. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test at screening.

          7. Females or males of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an
             acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for at least 24
             weeks after the last dose of study drug.

          8. Known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected) infection.

          9. Known history of active TB (bacillus tuberculosis).

         10. Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
