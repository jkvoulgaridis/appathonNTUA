      Open-label extension study of voxelotor for pediatric participants ages 4 to 18 years old
      with Sickle Cell Disease who have participated in voxelotor clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label extension (OLE) study of voxelotor for pediatric participants with Sickle Cell
      Disease who have participated in voxelotor clinical trials. Approximately 50 participants
      with sickle cell disease (SCD), aged ≥ 4 to ≤ 18 years will be enrolled at approximately 19
      global clinical sites. All participants will receive voxelotor once daily, administered
      orally as tablets, dispersible tablets, or powder for oral suspension formulation. The
      objective of this OLE is to assess the safety of, and SCD-related complications of, long-term
      treatment with voxelotor, in pediatric participants who have completed treatment in a Global
      Blood Therapeutics (GBT)-sponsored voxelotor pediatric clinical study.

    <description>All participants will receive voxelotor once daily (QD), administered orally as tablets, dispersible tablets, or a stick pack formulation (powder blend formulation packaged as stick packs). Participants aged ≥ 12 years will receive a voxelotor dose of 1500 mg QD, regardless of their body weight. Participants aged &lt; 12 years will receive a voxelotor dose based on their body weight, to provide exposure corresponding to the adult dose of 1500 mg QD. The participant's weight at study entry will be used to determine the starting voxelotor dose in this study. The dose should be adjusted if the participant's weight increases or decreases over 2 consecutive clinic visits.
Participants may receive study drug as long they continue to receive clinical benefit that outweighs risk as determined by the investigator and/or until the participant has access to voxelotor from an alternative source.</description>
