      This study through the detection of EGFR、ALK、ROS1、KRAS、HER2、BARF、NTRG1 seven ctDNA and
      exosome RNA in the blood and alveolar lavage of lung nodules patients and heavy smoking
      healthy population. If the results of ctDNA test is positive, the target nodule is malignant;
      if the reaults of ctDNA teste is negatie but exocome RNA is positive, the target nodule is
      also malignant. If the results of both tests are negtive, the target nodule is recognized as
      benign. The purpose is study the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of ctDNA
      and exosome combined detection in the identification of benign and malignant pulmonary
      nodules. Besides, the diagnostic efficacy of different specimens including blood and alveolar
      lavage in the identification of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules is also studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary nodules are round or irregular shape lesions with a diameter of less than or equal
      to 3cm. 10% lung nodules will become lung cancer, and lung cancer is evolved from small
      nodules.

      Liquid biopsy is an effective and noninvasive means to assist in the early diagnosis of lung
      cancer, including circulating tumor cell、exosome and ctDNA detection. CtDNA is used to detect
      DNA fragments relesased to plasma by cracking or apoptotic tumor cells. Exosomes are derived
      from living cells, and researchers found that exosome nucleic acid detection of living cells
      may be closely related to the dynamic development of tumors.

      This study through the detection of EGFR、ALK、ROS1、KRAS、HER2、BARF、NTRG1 seven ctDNA and
      exosome RNA in the blood and alveolar lavage of lung nodules patients and heavy smoking

    <description>Immunohistochemical method was used in ctDNA and exosome combined detection, to detect the blood and alveolar lavage of healthy people and patients with pulmonary nodules.Using the final diagnosis as the standard, the gene mutation threshold of benign and malignant lesions were demarcated, and the differences in gene expression between different types of diseases and the differences in diagnostic rates of blood and alveolar lavage fluid were explored.</description>
