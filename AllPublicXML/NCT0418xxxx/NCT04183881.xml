      This study [4827-005 (post market)] is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      long-term exposure to brodalumab in subjects with plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris,
      psoriatic arthritis) who have completed Study 4827-003 (Study 003) and in subjects with
      pustular psoriasis (generalized) or psoriatic erythroderma who have completed the Study
      4827-004 (Study 004). 4827-005 study was conducted as phase 3 clinical trial until July 4th
      2016 (approval date in Japan). After that date 4827-005 study was switched to phase 4 study.
