          -  Subjects, who completed the last treatment visit of the previous double-blind
             brexpiprazole BPD trial and who, in the opinion of the investigator, could potentially
             benefit from administration of brexpiprazole for the treatment of BPD.

          -  Male or female outpatients, ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at the time of informed

          -  Sexually active males or females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) who do not agree to
             practice 2 different methods of birth control or remain abstinent during the trial and
             for 30 days after the last dose of IMP. Male subjects must also agree not to donate
             sperm from trial screening/baseline through 30 days after the last dose of IMP.

          -  Women who are breastfeeding and/or who have a positive pregnancy test result prior to
             receiving IMP.

          -  Subjects who participated in a clinical trial within 90 days prior to
             screening/baseline (with the exception of a previous brexpiprazole double-blind BPD
             trial) or who participated in more than 2 clinical trials within a year prior to
             screening/baseline.
