             measurable disease in the serum or the urine: serum immunoglobulin free light chain
             ≥10 mg/dL and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa/lambda free light chain ratio. Light
             chain MM without measurable disease in the serum or the urine is a specific definition
             in this study, which refers to subjects whose M-protein in the serum and M-protein in
             the urine is undetectable; 2) received at least 2 standard regimens, determined as
             progressive disease (PD) by IMWG criteria; received at least 3 prior lines of
             treatment for MM, undergone at least 1 complete cycle of treatment for each line,
             unless PD was documented by IMWG criteria as the best response to the regimen; 3)
             received a proteasome inhibitor(PI) and an immunomodulatory therapy (IMiD); 4)
             documented disease progression during, or within 12 months of, most recent
             anti-myeloma therapy.

             enrollment;

          4. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1;

          5. Adequate organ function is defined as: 1) hemoglobin≥8.0g/dL(did not receive red blood

             prior to laboratory tests); 3) ANC ≥0.75×10^9/L(did not receive supportive treatment
             ≤7 days prior to laboratory tests; growth factors are allowed); 4) total bilirubin
             &lt;2×ULN (for subjects with congenital hyperbilirubinemia such as Gilbert's syndrome,
             direct bilirubin≤1.5×ULN); 5) creatinine clearance (according to MDRD formulas or 24h
             urine collection result) ≥40 mL/min/1.73m^2; 6) ALT and AST &lt;3×ULN; 7) corrected serum
             calcium ≤12.5 mg/dL (≤3.1 mmol/L), or free calcium ion ≤6.5 mg/dL(≤1.6 mmol/L); 8)

          7. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective contraception
             continuously from signing informed consent form until ≥100 days after CAR-T infusion
