  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Another term for myelodysplastic syndrome is bone marrow failure. The bone marrow is where
      components of blood such as red cells, platelets and white cells are made. In bone marrow
      failure, the ability for bone marrow to make these cells is decreased. In myelodysplastic
      syndrome, this decreased bone marrow function is believed to result from abnormalities that
      prevent the normal maturation process by which bone marrow cells develop into red blood
      cells, white blood cells and platelets. In myelodysplastic syndrome, these abnormal bone
      marrow cells occupy space in the bone marrow and prevent the function of remaining normal
      bone marrow cells.

      One approach to treating the abnormal growth of immature cells is to give chemotherapy which
      damages DNA within these cells and causes their death. Unfortunately, such therapy has
      side-effects, since even normal cells can be affected by the treatment. Both 5-azacitidine
      (5AZA) and decitabine (DEC) are FDA-approved to treat MDS. In this study, 5AZA and DEC will
      be administered using an alternating low doses schedule in an attempt to overcome the known
      mechanisms of resistance to the administration of 5AZA or DEC as single agents caused by
      automatic adaptive shifts in DNA metabolism.

      This will be a single arm, open label pilot study of 5AZA-alt-DEC. Participants will be
      treated for a minimum of 24 weeks in the absence of clear evidence of progressive disease.
      Participants who have any response will be permitted to continue treatment until relapse or
      progression of disease that is not sensitive to protocol defined dose escalation.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine Overall Response Rate (ORR) of
      5AZA-alt-DEC. The combined response endpoint will include complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR), and hematologic improvement (HI), with HI criteria specifically as defined by
      IWG criteria

      The secondary endpoints of this study include:

        -  Cumulative incidence of response for both CR and overall response

        -  Duration of response (DOR)

        -  Safety evaluation by tabulation of adverse events of grade 3 and higher

      Correlative endpoints include:

        -  Correlation of DNMT1 depletion with clinical response criteria

        -  Correlation of clinical response with disease biological phenotype measured by
           morphology and cytogenetics

        -  Exploratory measurements of pyrimidine metabolism pre-treatment and on-therapy

             tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice, who has not undergone a documented
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or has had a menses any time in the preceding

                  then they will be considered eligible for study.

               -  Uncontrolled concurrent malignancy

               -  Congestive heart failure of NYHA class III/IV. Participants with compensated

                  requirements.

               -  Any other prior or ongoing condition, in the opinion of the investigator, that
                  could adversely affect the safety of the participant or impair the assessment of
                  study results.

          -  WOCBP and males that are unwilling to agree to use dual contraceptive measures (i.e.,
             hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence, condom) prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation. Should a female subject become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform the
             treating physician immediately

          -  Sexually active male who is unwilling to use a condom when engaging in any sexual
             contact with a female with child-bearing potential, beginning at the screening visit
             and continuing until 4 weeks after taking the last dose of 5AZA-alt-DEC.

          -  Participants with known active HIV infection, as this will further increase the risk
             for opportunistic infections. However, participants with chronic HIV with undetectable
             viral load by PCR, without opportunistic infection, and on a stable regimen of
             antiretroviral therapy would be eligible.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of azacitidine or decitabine
             formulations
