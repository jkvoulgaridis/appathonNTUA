  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of the text messaging (SMS-based) disease management
      intervention to improve adherence to stimulants in adults with Attention
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      Participants in the study will receive customized text messages twice a day, every day, for a
      duration of 9 months. The text messages will include reminders to adhere to the
      individualized medication regimen, reminders to call their clinician for a prescription
      refill followed by reminders to pick up medication from the pharmacy, and educational
      reminders about ADHD and its treatment.
