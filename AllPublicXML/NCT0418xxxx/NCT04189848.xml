    <textblock>
      This study in healthy men and women looks at the injection site experience of semaglutide and
      dulaglutide given subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin). Participants will receive 1 dose of
      semaglutide 0.25 mg and 1 dose of dulaglutide 0.75 mg on the same day. The 2 injections will
      be given at least 30 minutes apart, one in each side of the stomach. Participants will be in
      the clinic research center for 1 day. A follow-up phone call will take place between 4 and 5
      weeks after the injections were given.
