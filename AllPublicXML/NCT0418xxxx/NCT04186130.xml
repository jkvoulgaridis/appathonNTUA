      Purpose: In order to verify the hypothesis that the composition of intestinal microbiota in
      children with spina bifida is different from that of normal control, prospective comparative
      analysis would be performed.

      Background of the study:

      Spina bifida is a congenital neurological disorder, causing neurogenic bowel. It has been
      known that the intestinal microbiota in spinal cord injury patient was different than that of
      control. Changes in intestinal motility, mucous secretion, immune surveillance, and
      epithelial barrier permeability are possible causes of this change. As spina bifida is also
      related with neurogenic bowel, the investigators hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota
      in spina bifida is different from that of normal control.

      Patients total 30 patients and 10 controls Inclusion for patients

      Patients who meet following conditions:

      1) Children over 3 years old and under 12 years old who have been diagnosed with spinal
      bifida with spinal MRI Exclusion for patients and controls

      1) Children with known inflammatory bowel disease or cloacal anomaly

      Statistical analysis Statistical processing for fecal samples is aimed at alpha or beta
      diversity using bioinformatics, and the Kruskal-Wallis test is used to compare similarities
      or differences between each fecal sample. Prior to statistical analysis, the relative
      abundance of the detected microorganisms is analyzed first, and microorganisms having a
      distribution less than 0.1% are excluded from the analysis, and the remaining microorganisms
      are analyzed in the 'genus' step.

    <description>Feces are collected about 1-2 grams and stored at -80'c refrigerator. After analysis, using biometrics, statistical processing for fecal samples is aimed at alpha or beta diversity. The Kruskal-Wallis test is used to compare similarities or differences between each fecal sample. Prior to statistical analysis, the relative abundance of the detected microorganisms is analyzed first, and microorganisms having a distribution less than 0.1% are excluded from the analysis, and the remaining microorganisms are analyzed in the 'genus' step.</description>
