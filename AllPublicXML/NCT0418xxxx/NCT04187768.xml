    <textblock>
      This is a blood collection study being conducted to better understand and describe the
      immunological blood profile changes in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer
      undergoing treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Blood will be collected from healthy
      volunteers and patients with non small cell lung cancer

    <description>Patients with advanced NSCLC will have blood collected prior to treatment and after completing 3 cycles of immune checkpoint therapy. . If a patient is noted to have progressive disease after 2 cycles of treatment, a sample will be collected after the 2nd cycle. If a patient is noted to have pseudoprogression (determined at the discretion of the treating physician), an additional sample may be collected after 3 cycles of therapy.</description>
