  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to examine the effectiveness of a brief screening method that may
      predict which people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are most likely to show a
      positive response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. Participants
      will be recruited over approximately 3.25 years, until at least 94 participants complete the
      17 week study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and after consultation with research oversight entities,
      recruitment has been placed on temporary admin hold as of 3/17/2020

      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed to approximately 60% of
      Veterans with PTSD treated within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). However, many
      patients are not responsive to SSRIs. Currently, there is no way to determine whether a
      particular patient will benefit from an SSRI; treatment is primarily accomplished through
      'trial and error' over several weeks or months. The overarching goal of this study is to
      investigate the pre-treatment usefulness of a simple electrophysiological test for predicting
      the likelihood of a favorable response to an SSRI. This study will investigate whether a
      brief pre-treatment auditory event-related potentials procedure [referred to going forward as
      &quot;Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials&quot; (LDAEP)] offers a means for predicting
      treatment response to an SSRI for men and women diagnosed with PTSD.

      This study has four aims: 1) To determine the strength of the relationship between LDAEP and
      clinical response to SSRI treatment. 2) To determine LDAEP cut-off values that would enable
      clinicians to make individualized SSRI treatment recommendations. 3) To assess the
      reliability of LDAEP and the usefulness of change in LDAEP as an objective measure of SSRI
      response. 4) Exploratory: To determine whether the relationship between LDAEP and clinical
      response to sertraline differs between men and women.

      Means to Protect Subjects' Identities:

      To ensure confidentiality, questionnaire and interview data will be stored in locked filing
      cabinets within locked offices. Each participant will have his or her own participant number
      and these numbers will be the only means by which participant information can be identified.
      Electronic data will be stored on a secure private, password-protected drive that can only be
      accessed by members of the study team and labeled only with the participant number. One list
      of names and participant numbers will be kept on a private, password-protected computer
      account on a separate drive from the de-identified data and accessible only to the study
      team.

      ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS IN RESEARCH NOT FUNDED BY NIH Description Of Identification Of Drug:
      SERTRALINE. Because the goal of this study is to identify pre-treatment predictors of SSRI
      response that ultimately could be used in routine clinical care, the investigators designed
      the study with ecological validity in mind. Specifically, the investigators chose sertraline
      as the study medication because it is: a) the most commonly prescribed SSRI in the US, b) one
      of only two FDA-approved drugs for treating PTSD, and c) one of the two most effective SSRIs
      for major depression, a common comorbidity with PTSD. Dosing will follow clinical practice
      guidelines, i.e., doses will be chosen based on clinical response and tolerability.

      Description Of Administration Of Drug: The investigators are using an approach , which
      represents enhanced clinical care in that participants discuss medication levels, side
      effects, and symptoms with a psychiatrist every two weeks. Study medication and placebo will
      be stored and distributed by VA Boston Pharmacy service.

    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is the &quot;gold standard&quot; clinical interview for assessing PTSD. This measure will be used to characterize the sample regarding PTSD diagnosis and as a measure of PTSD severity. Each of the 20 symptoms of PTSD included in DSM-5 is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0-4, with a 0 or 1 indicating that the symptom is absent or subthreshold and a score of 2-4 indicating that a symptom has reached the threshold to be included as a symptom and ranges in severity from moderate to extreme. The total range of the CAPS-5 is 0-80.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Self Report (QIDS-SR) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR will be used to measure the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS provides equivalent weightings (0-3) for each symptom item, gives clearly stated anchors that estimate the frequency and severity of symptoms, and includes all items required to diagnose a major depressive episode.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is the most widely used clinician-administered scale for assessing severity of depression symptoms. The 6-item unidimensional core Melancholia subscale of the HAM-D will be used as the primary depression outcome variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>DASS-21 is a 21-item measure that assesses the severity of a range of symptoms common to depression, anxiety, and stress. The total score can be used as a measure of general distress or depression, anxiety, and stress subscales can be scored separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Participants will rate how much they experienced each symptom on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely&quot;) during the past week (total range=0-80). The PCL-5 will be anchored to participants' worst traumatic event. In addition to the administration of these measures during the four assessment sessions, the PCL-5 will also be administered bi-weekly at each psychiatrist check-in visit.</description>

    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS consists of two, 10-item mood scales that measure positive (e.g., 'enthusiastic') and negative (e.g., 'upset') affect separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>SCL-90-R measures the following nine primary psychiatric symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. The Global Severity Index (GSI) is the average rating given to all 90 items and provides a measure of general psychopathology.</description>
