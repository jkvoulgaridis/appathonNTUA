  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age is a major risk factor for the development of cognitive disorders and neurodegenerative
      pathologies. Cognitive disorders during the phases of bipolar disease are known to exist, and
      alterations increase significantly after the age of 65. Drug treatments seem to have only a
      limited effect. A cognitive stimulation program has proven his benefit to patients over 65
      with neurodegenerative diseases (Israel, 2004). We propose to evaluate this cognitive
      stimulation program that we have adapted to bipolar disease.

      Bipolar disorders, which belong to the category of mood disorders, are the 6th leading cause
      of disability in the world. Cognitive disorders are known to exist during the phases of
      bipolar disease, and alterations increase significantly after the age of 65. Recent studies
      have shown that attention, memory and executive function impairments are the main causes of
      cognitive disorders. Residual symptoms have a significant impact on the risk of relapse into
      bipolar disorder and on quality of life. Cognitive stimulation (CS) is a pedagogical approach
      based on the idea that cognitive skills contribute to personal development in the same way as
      psychological and social factors. This study aims at assessing a cognitive stimulation
      program initially developed for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and adapted to
      bipolar disease. This program will be compared to the usual practice consisting in
      consultation with psychiatrist and sometimes in intervention of home nurses.

    <description>The cognitive stimulation sessions are carried out using Liliane Israël's &quot;TRAIN YOUR MEMORY&quot; software, and are divided into two parts: the first part is essentially cognitive and the second relates to the daily life of the Bipolar patient.
This training method consists of combining two means of intervention, pedagogical action and psychotherapeutic effect. It aims to stimulate, develop and strengthen the basic mechanisms underlying memory phenomena (sensory acuity, attention, associations, structuring, executive functions, spatial and temporal landmarks, associative recruitment). It is presented in the form of exercises divided into eight modules.</description>

    <description>Patients participate in one session per week according to the following schedule:
2 sensory stimulation sessions: identify sensations, emotions, how to manage them.
2 sessions on association, verbal fluency, and imagination: language as a tool for expression in the face of illness.
2 voluntary attention sessions: improve daily attention.
2 sessions of intellectual structuring: stimulating and maintaining memory, carrying out external activities.
2 sessions of structuring through language: impact on social life.
2 sessions stimulating the temporal and spatial landmarks: agenda, daily trips.</description>
