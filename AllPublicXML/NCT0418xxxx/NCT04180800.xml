  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social isolation among elderly people is a frequent and major determinant for health.

      The risk of premature death is 2 to 5 time higher for socially isolated people, similarly for
      morbidity, duration of healing and complications rate.

      Denutrition is also frequent for elderly people with potentially serious consequences.
      Vitamin deficiency, especially in B9 and B12 vitamins, are often associated with denutrition
      among elderly people.

      Folic acid (vitamin B9) is not influenced by inflammation and folic acid income are
      necessarily exogene. Vitamin B9 is provided by fresh fruits and vegetables, and giblets.

      The investigators observed a high prevalence in folic acid deficiency for socially isolated
      elderly patients. The investigators made the hypothesis that a folic acid defiency is
      associated with social isolation for elderly people.

      The primary purpose is the study of the association between folic acid deficiency (measured
      by dosing of plasma concentration of vitamin B9) and social isolation evaluated by Lubben
      Social Network Scale in 6 questions.

      The secondary purposes are the study of the correlation between folic acid deficiency and
      social conditions, nutritional status, biological data, poly pharmacy, cognitive functions,
      dependency and length of stay at hospital.

    <description>One short oral interview to complete the Lubben Social Network Scale in auto-survey, translated in French. It contains 6 questions on 30 points, higher scores are associated with more social engagement, lower scores, specifically under 12/30, are associated with social isolation.</description>
