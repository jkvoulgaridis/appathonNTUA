  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to include any participant who has registered and plans to attend the
      Inner Engineering In-Person Completion Course. This course was offered at two time periods
      (March and April 2019) in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, respectively. The investigators are
      currently recruiting for the upcoming conferences in Toronto &amp; Dallas (November 2019).
      Investigators anticipate that this study can include up to 5,000 study participants.
      Participants would attend this course and complete the pre-modules regardless of whether or
      not they participate in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to enroll participants who have registered for the Inner Engineering
      in-person course. Briefly, this course is a 1-2 day in-person course, in which participants
      will learn a simple 21 minute practice called Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya, also known as
      Shambhavi Kriya. Shambhavi Kriya is a powerful and purifying energy technique which
      incorporates the breath. This practice is said to align the body systems so that the body,
      mind and emotions function in harmony. More information about the course can be found on the
      ISHA foundation website: https://www.innerengineering.com/ieo-new/completion/.

      Registrants are asked to complete a series of seven online modules prior to the start of the
      in-person course. The online series provides the participants with an opportunity to
      intellectually explore the basics of life using methods that are distilled from the essence
      of yogic sciences. The course imparts wisdom to manage the body, mind, emotions, and the
      fundamental life energy within.

      Importantly, the course modules and the in-person meeting and subsequent meditation and yoga
      practices would occur regardless of whether or not a person decided to participate in the
      study. The only study procedure imparted includes requesting the participants to complete a
      series of surveys over a one-year period.

      This study only involves administration of electronic surveys at six different time points.
      These time points include: at the time of consent; after completing the Inner Engineering
      Online modules but before the in-person course begins; after the completion of the in-person
      course; at 6 weeks; 6 month and 12 months. These surveys can take up to 15 minutes to
      complete. Electronic reminders will be sent to participants who have not completed these
      surveys within a week.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators collect these scores at the 6 pre-specified time points; i.e., at the time of consent; after completing the IEO modules but before conference; post conference completion; at 6 weeks; 6 month and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The study aims to evaluate changes in mood profiles affected by the Inner Engineering Online (IEO) over time. For evaluation of mood profiles the investigators use a validated scale named, Profile of Mood States (POMS). The scale measures different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time and calculates Total Mood Disturbances by performing a sub-scale analysis. The subscales defined include Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, Confusion &amp; Vigor. Higher scores suggestive of poorer outcome. Logistic regression analysis is performed on the outcome measures collected over the specified time-frame.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Perceived Stress Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>The investigators collect these scores at the 6 pre-specified time points; i.e., at the time of consent; after completing the IEO modules but before conference; post conference completion; at 6 weeks; 6 month and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The study aims to evaluate changes in perceived levels of stress in survey participants and the effect Inner Engineering has over them in long term. The investigators use a validated scale for this purpose named, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The scale measures the degree to which situations in participant's life are appraised as stressful. This is defined to be the key secondary outcome for the study. Higher scores are suggestive of more stress. Logistic regression analysis is performed on the outcome measures collected over the specified time-frame.</description>
