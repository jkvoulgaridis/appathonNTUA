  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is closely linked to the success of lung transplantations (LTx) (1,2). Studies have
      shown that frailty causes a diminished physical performance in candidates for LTx and an
      increased 30 day rate of re-hospitalization after surgery. Furthermore, frailty is associated
      with a higher one-year-mortality rate after LTx in frail compared to non-frail patients
      (1,3,4).

      Some evidence that frailty in LTx-candidates can be decreased by a suitable rehabilitation
      program suggests that improving the frailty status in post-LTx patients can be a further
      strategy to contribute to an overall success in LTx. However, at the moment these possible
      benefits are not investigated yet. Therefore the aim of this study is to observe the effect
      of a three-week inpatient rehabilitation on frailty in patients after LTx.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome describing a loss of physical and/or cognitive
      functionality which leads to a decreased resistance to stressors such as operations or
      illness. It is associated with increased number of falls, exacerbations, adverse health
      outcomes and a higher mortality (7-10).

      Frail LTx-candidates have a higher risk of being delisted before transplantation, adverse
      transplantation outcomes and a higher one-year-mortality compared to non-frail candidates.
      However, studies show that frailty can be decreased by physical training (11-13). A recent
      prospective cohort study in the UK observed a significant decrease of frailty in patients
      with COPD participating at an inpatient rehabilitation program (5). Singer et al. (USA) could
      detect a significant decrease of frailty by a homebased training for LTx-candidates (6).

      Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a three-week inpatient rehabilitation
      program on physical frailty (measured by Short Physical Performance Battery) in patients
      after LTx. Additionally, other functional measures as well as the cognitive, social and
      psychological state will be assessed in order to better understand the complex syndrome of
      frailty and the effects of rehabilitation.

      Design:

      This study is a prospective observational trial. The number of 30 participants is based on a
      sample size calculation. Assessments will take place in the beginning of rehabilitation
      program and at discharge.
