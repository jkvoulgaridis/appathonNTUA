  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a kind of hematological malignancy caused by the proliferation of
      malignant clonal plasma cells. In recent years, the emergence of new therapeutic drugs such
      as bortezomib and lenalidomide has significantly improved the therapeutic effect of mm.
      However, due to the presence of myeloma stem cells, most patients will inevitably relapse and
      die. With the development of biomedicine and immunology, immunotherapy with chimeric antigen
      receptor modified T cells has attracted great attention for its amazing efficacy. CAR-T cells
      carry receptors that can specifically recognize myeloma associated antigens, and their
      killing effect is not limited by MHC molecules. B-cell mature antigen is only expressed on
      the surface of B cells in germinal center, malignant and normal plasma cells, not on other
      normal human tissues and CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells. It is a relatively specific high
      expression on the surface of myeloma cells, which is an ideal target for MM immunotherapy.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of BCMA targeted T cell
      infusion in the treatment of BCMA positive multiple myeloma.
