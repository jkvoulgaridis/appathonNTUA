  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive exam. This exam performed on the
      lung continuously produces cross-sectional images of lung function. It may be relevant in
      lung description.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to follow the patients after extubation for the lung description.

      EIT exam is performed before extubation, during follow-up visits and 48H after extubation
