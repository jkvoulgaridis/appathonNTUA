    <measure>Early daily occupational therapy intervention feasability (case report form with questions to ask)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to intensive care unit discharge, estimated as an average of 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the feasibility of providing early daily occupational therapy interventions in the Adult Intensive Medicine Service of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois within the current interdisciplinary team. Every day, the occupational therapist complete a case report form which say if the intervention can be realise or not in order to find the feasability of a daily early occupationnal therapy intervention. The feasability is mesure every day for each participant until they leave the intensive care unit.
the feasibility assessment contains several elements, including the possibility or not of carrying out the intervention, but also the safety aspect with the collection of possible adverse events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily occupational therapy intervention description by completion of case report form</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to intensive care unit discharge, estimated as an average of 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Describe the content of the occupational therapy intervention in intensive care unit. Occupational therapists complete a form for each intervention (daily) regarding the type of intervention they have performed with the participants (positioning, daily activities, etc.) until the end of the intervention, when the patient leaves the intensive care unit.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be the one usually carried out but earlier and on a daily basis. It will consist of the initial assessment and then positioning and/or carrying out activities of daily living.
The daily duration of the intervention will be about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The overall duration of the intervention will be determined according to the objectives and will be at most equal to the time of stay in the intensive care unit.</description>
