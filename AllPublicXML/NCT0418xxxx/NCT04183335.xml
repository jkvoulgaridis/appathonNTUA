      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on itch response in patients with prurigo nodularis
      (PN), inadequately controlled on topical prescription therapy or when those therapies are not
      advisable

      To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on additional itch endpoints in patients with PN,
      inadequately controlled on topical prescription therapy or when those therapies are not
      advisable To demonstrate efficacy of dupilumab on skin lesions of PN To demonstrate the
      improvement in health-related quality of life To evaluate safety outcome measures To evaluate
      immunogenicity of dupilumab

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

        Must be 18 to 80 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.

        With a clinical diagnosis of PN defined by all of the following:

          -  Diagnosed by a dermatologist for at least 3 months before the Screening visit

          -  On the WI-NRS ranging from 0 to 10, patients must have an average worst itch score of
             ≥7 in the 7 days prior to Day1.

          -  Patients must have a minimum of 20 PN lesions in total on both legs, and/or both arms
             and/or trunk, at Screening visit and Day 1

          -  History of failing a 2-week course of medium-to-superpotent topical corticosteroids
             (TCS) or when TCS are not medically advisable

          -  Have applied a stable dose of topical emollient (moisturizer) once or twice daily for
             at least 5 out of the 7 consecutive days immediately before Day 1 Must be willing and
             able to complete a daily symptom eDiary for the duration of the study

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

          -  Presence of skin morbidities other than PN and mild atopic dermatitis that may
             interfere with the assessment of the study outcomes

          -  PN secondary to medications

          -  PN secondary to medical conditions such as neuropathy or psychiatric disease

          -  Within 6 months before the screening visit, or documented diagnosis of moderate to
             severe AD from screening visit to randomization visit

          -  Severe concomitant illness(es) under poor control that, in the investigator's
             judgment, would adversely affect the patient's participation in the study

          -  Severe renal conditions (eg, patients with uremia and/or on dialysis)

          -  Participants with uncontrolled thyroid disease.

          -  Active tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, or a history of
             incompletely treated tuberculosis unless documented adequately treated

          -  Diagnosed active endoparasitic infections; suspected or high risk of endoparasitic
             infection, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessment have ruled out
             active infection before randomization.

          -  Active chronic or acute infection (except HIV infection) requiring treatment with
             systemic antibiotics, antivirals, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before
             the screening visit and during the screening period

          -  Known or suspected immunodeficiency

          -  Active malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years before the baseline visit,
             except completely treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix, completely treated and
             resolved non-metastatic squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
