    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction is assessed in patients with chronic venous insufficiency of lower
      limbs (grade C4 according to C — clinical manifestations, E — etiologic factors, A — anatomic
      distribution of disease, and P — underlying pathophysiologic findings (CEAP) classification)
      prior to and after endovenous surgical procedure, i.e. endovenous laser ablation of great
      saphenous vein, microphlebectomy of varicose branches. Two treatment groups (with and without
      additional pharmacotherapy) are compared.

    <description>Measurement of microcirculation of the operated limb by laser flowmetry using portable device equipped with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). LDF registration will be performed at leg anterior surface (lower third) for 10 minutes.
The results of measurements will be automatically analyzed and fixed in single protocol which includes the following parameters:
Mean value of tissue blood perfusion.
Flux amplitude — standard deviation for oscillations of microcirculation values at given time interval.
Flux motion index.
Spectral analysis of blood flow oscillations with determination of oscillation amplitude at given frequency band, as well as determination of contribution of certain frequency bands into total power of biological rhythm spectrum.
Microvascular tone and intravascular resistance
Microvascular reactivity and functional reserve of the capillary bed with the help of functional tests.</description>

The 20-item questionnaire, which provides a global index and an outline of 4 quality-of-life dimensions—&quot;pain&quot; (4 items), &quot;physical&quot; (4 items), &quot;psychological&quot; (9 items), and &quot;social&quot; (3 items). Items on the CIVIQ-20 scale are scored from 1 to 5. A low score corresponds to greater patient comfort, high score represents worse life quality.</description>

    <description>Severity of disease estimated by Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). It is used to assess those with venous disease that that is complementary to the CEAP classification. The score includes 10 clinical parameters (pain, varicose veins, venous edema, skin hyperpigmentation, inflammation, induration, number of ulcers, durations of ulcers, size of ulcers, and compliance with compression therapy). Each item is graded from zero to three depending on severity (None = 0, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, Severe = 3). The lower the score the less severity, the higher the score the more severity.</description>

    <description>Surgical treatment is performed as endovenous laser ablation of GSV and microphlebectomy of varicose branches according to a standard protocol:
The intervention includes treatment of the pathological upright reflux and varicose veins. Ultrasound-guided GSV puncture at the upper third of the leg under local anesthesia. The light guide is inserted into the vein lumen and pushed through to the saphenofemoral junction. Under ultrasound guidance the light guide is positioned at v. epigastrica superficialis junction. Under ultrasound guidance tumescent anesthesia is produced around the GSV from puncture site up to the saphenofemoral junction. Laser coagulation (with radial light guide), linear energy density — 75 J/cm, automatic traction of the light guide at the speed 0.7 mm/sec. Varicose veins are resected through skin punctures using Varady hook 1-2 mm.</description>
