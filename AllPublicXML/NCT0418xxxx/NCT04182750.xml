  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The background for this project is the growing concern about women's use of medications
      during pregnancy. Several studies have shown that up to 80% of all pregnant women use at
      least one medication during pregnancy, most commonly prescription-free medications for
      pregnancy-related ailments. Despite the frequent use of medications during pregnancy pregnant
      women tend to overestimate the teratogenic risk of medications - often resulting in unfound
      anxiety, non-adherence to needed medication, use of herbal &quot;natural&quot; medications, and in the
      worst case, termination of otherwise wanted pregnancies. Specifically, the investigators have
      found that ailments such as nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), often are mismanaged,
      resulting in profound impacts on the women´s quality of life, but are often being neglected
      by healthcare personnel.

      The objective of this project is to investigate whether a pharmacist consultation provided in
      early pregnancy can result in optimized management of pregnancy-related ailment, a higher
      quality of life and reduce sick leave among pregnant women. The investigators will capitalize
      on the existence of a unique personal identification number allocated to every citizen in
      Norway and link the self-reported data generated in the intervention study to five national
      health registries. As even mild NVP has been shown to have a huge impact on pregnant women's
      quality of life, the investigators will specifically focus on preventative measures for NVP.

      The investigators main hypothesis is:

      &quot;A pharmacist intervention focusing on safe medication use and in early pregnancy can reduce
      sick leave days and rates, enhance adherence, promote better management of common
      pregnancy-related ailments (especially NVP), and improve pregnant women's quality of life&quot;

      The investigators will include all pregnant women in pregnancy weeks &lt;12. Pregnant women
      under the age of 18, women who do not understand Norwegian and women for some other reason
      are unable to sign the consent form will be excluded. Women eligible for inclusion will be
      allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. Participants in the
      intervention group will be directed to the nearest study pharmacy for the intervention. The
      proposed study intervention is to be applied and carried out in the community pharmacy.
      Approximately 10-15 community pharmacists across the country will be involved. If the
      distance to a study pharmacy is too far for a physical meeting, the intervention will be
      performed over the telephone; otherwise, the private information room in the pharmacies will
      be utilized.

      All pharmacists involved in the study will be specifically trained to perform the
      consultation. They will complete several e-learning modules on pharmacotherapy in pregnancy
      and attend a full-day training work-shop focusing on communication skills led by experienced
      clinical pharmacists.

      Data will be collected by four online questionnaires, one at baseline in the first trimester,
      one during the second trimester, one during the third trimester, and the last one in the
      post-partum period. Participants in the intervention group will, in addition, complete a
      satisfaction questionnaire right after the completion of the consultation. All questionnaires
      will be distributed to the participants by email. Data about the participants will, in
      addition, be collected from five national registries; National Sick Leave Database
      (Forløpsdatabasen Trygd), The Norwegian Patient Registry, The Norwegian Prescription
      Database, The Medical Birth Registry of Norway, and the Municipality Patient and User
      Registry (Kommunalt Bruker- og Pasientregister). These data will be linked to the
      self-reported data (by the unique identification number of every citizen in Norway) collected
      during the intervention study.

      An economic evaluation will be done to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      All study pharmacists involved in the study will be invited to participate in a qualitative
      interview to share their experience and opinions regarding the pharmacist intervention.

      Participants enrolled in the intervention study will be invited to a qualitative interview to
      share their inputs and opinions on what a mobile application for self-management and an
      online patient-centered decision support tool for NVP should include.

    <description>The intervention is a patient-centered consultation that will last about 15 minutes. The intervention is defined as &quot;A planned, individualized, and structured conversation with the purpose to relieve pregnant women for any concern and answer questions she may have regarding self-care ailments and medication use in pregnancy&quot;. Specifically, the consultation will:
Answer any questions the participants may have within pharmaceutical care.
Improve pregnant women's understanding of common pregnancy-related ailments and hence contribute to better management of the ailments.
Raise awareness, provide confidence, and give information about safe medications options in pregnancy
Focus on preventative measures for NVP.
Contribute to better adherence for needed/chronic medication throughout the pregnancy.
The pharmacists will beforehand have access to the women´s answers from the baseline questionnaire Q1, including information about her medical conditions and medication use.</description>
