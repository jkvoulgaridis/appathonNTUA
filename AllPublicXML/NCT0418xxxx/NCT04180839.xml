    <textblock>
      This study is based on the retrieval-extinction paradigm.As with the efficacy, the experiment
      aims to test the effect of the retrieval-extinction paradigm on game craving and behave of
      IGD subjects, so as to provide an empirical basis for the development of effective
      intervention means of Internet gaming disorder.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in gaming craving at cue-reactivity task between the two test sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline , one day after training</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to passively watch three kinds of videos and rate their craving immediately after each video clip using 10-point visual analog scales.The task assesses the severity of cue-induced craving for Internet gaming, with high scores indicating great cue-induced craving.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in gaming Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire is given to participants to record their gaming craving at baseline、after the first day of training、after the second day of training、one day after training、1 week and 1 month after tranning respectively</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Questionnaire of gaming Urges questionnaire is a 10‐item gaming urge questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 10 to assess gaming craving. The questionnaire assesses the severity of craving for Internet gaming behavior, with high scores indicating great craving.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in gaming time at baseline、1-Week and 1-month Follow-Up</measure>
    <time_frame>A diary is given to participants to record their gaming time at baseline、 1-week and 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>At the baseline、end of the first week and month test session, participants will receive a diary in which to record the gaming time after the 1-week and 1-month follow-up period.</description>

    <description>During one training session,participants will first view a 5-min retrieval video containing gaming content and then, 10 minutes later, receive 1-hour of extinction training in which they will be administered four sequences of video, picture and in vivo gaming cues.
The whole training includes 2 training sessions. Participants will receive one training session once a day for two consectutive days.</description>
