  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After multimodal therapy of head-and-neck tumors, patients often develop local recurrence,
      locally progressive disease or second primary tumors. In this highly pre-treated patient
      cohort, therapeutic options are limited. Patients that are not candidates for salvage surgery
      may benefit from re-irradiation. Despite recent technical advances, re-irradiation is
      associated with severe side effects. Carbon ion Re-Radiotherapy (reCIRT) has shown
      encouraging results in retrospective analyses with moderate toxicity.

      In the current Phase-II CARE-trial, reCIRT and conventional photon re-irradiation in patients
      with recurrent or progressive locally advanced head-and-neck cancer will be assessed
      regarding toxicity/ safety, local progression-free survival, overall survival and
      quality-of-life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of head-and-neck cancer worldwide amounts to around 550.000 cases per year,
      with male patients affected significantly more often. Common risk factors are smoking,
      alcohol, viral infections, immunodeficiency or genetic factors. Locally advanced
      head-and-neck tumors can lead to severe symptoms such as dysphagia, cachexia and tumor pain
      with a significant decrease of the quality-of-life. The prognosis depends on multiple factors
      such as TNM-staging, tumor volume, histology, general condition, age and smoking. Further
      risk factors are positive resection margins, extracapsular extension and perineural invasion.
      While metastatic spread significantly decreases overall survival, the life-limiting problem
      in patients with head-and-neck cancer is locally invasive and destructive tumor growth
      leading to a decrease of the performance status and quality of life. After multimodal therapy
      of locally advanced head-and-neck tumors, around 30 - 50% of patients will develop local
      recurrence or locally progressive disease and up to 8% of patients with HNSCC will develop a
      second primary tumor in the head-and-neck .
