    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
A TEAE is defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the investigational product (IP) to 14 days after the last dose of IP for the double blind part or moving to the open-label extension part, whichever comes first.
An IP-related TEAE is defined as any TEAE with a causal relationship of &quot;yes&quot; by the investigator.</description>
