  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonization by Multiple Drug Resistant Organisms (MDROs) during patient hospitalization
      requires expensive isolation measures and renders the return or transfer to other departments
      or institutions often impossible. Currently there is no specific treatment available.
      Patients have to wait for spontaneous clearance which can take months or does not happen at
      all.

      The study will test the effect of Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) on gut MDRO colonization.
      The focus will be on patients with a long-term colonization by Gram-negative bacteria for
      which isolation is warranted. Participants will be randomized into two treatment groups;
      allogenic FMT versus autologous FMT. A third group of participants will be monitored but will
      not receive an FMT. Decolonization rate will be compared one month after treatment.
      Additionally gut microbial composition will be studied up to one year after FMT.

      This double-blind controlled randomized study will test the efficacy of Fecal Microbiota
      Transfer (FMT) on gut Multiple Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) colonization.

      Participants:

      The study targets hospitalized patients (&gt;18 years old) that need to stay in isolation
      because of colonization by Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriales (CRE), non-E. coli
      Enterobacteriales that produce extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or Multi Drug
      Resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas and MDR Acinetobacter species. Participants will be randomized in
      two groups (allogenic and autologous FMT). Additionally a third group of participants will be
      monitored without intervention.

      Treatment:

      Participants in the allogenic FMT- group will receive treatment using healthy donor
      microbiota preferably through naso-duodenal/-jejunal administration (Cortrak). Donor material
      will be supplied by the Ghent Stool Bank. The colonization status will be monitored on a
      regular basis (at least once per week) by culturing fecal swabs. Additionally fecal samples
      will be taken on fixed time points for microbial composition analysis (16S ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid metagenomics).

      Controls:

      Participants in the autologous FMT-group will will receive an FMT with their own microbiota
      to account for the effects of the intervention itself. Participants in the &quot;no intervention&quot;
      group will not receive an FMT. Both control groups will be monitored and sampled identically
      to the allogenic FMT-group.

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome (MDRO-decolonization rate in treatment versus control) will be evaluated
      1 month after FMT. Secondarily, safety and tolerability of the treatment will be assessed.
      The patients will be monitored up to 1 year after treatment to evaluate microbiome
      composition and to define parameters in the microbiome that are associated with clinical
      outcome.
