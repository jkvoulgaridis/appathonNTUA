    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes (change in bleeding sites (BOP) and
      probing depth reduction (PPD) after mechanical debridement of implant surfaces at sites
      exhibiting plaque induced inflammation with or without adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic
      therapy (aPDT) and assess the microbiologic profile of plaque samples before and after
      treatment with or without aPDT. samples.

    <description>Traditional non-surgical mechanical debridement along with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy will be done at implant sites by applying a photosensitizing dye methylene blue (0.1mg/ml) with a disposable syringe from the bottom of pocket in a coronal direction. The dye will be applied topically confined to the epithelialized space surrounding the implant fixture and will not be internalized. After 5 minutes in situ, the surrounding gingival tissues will be irradiated at six sites around the implant using a diode laser with a wavelength of 660nm, providing an energy density of 10 J/site, 100mW power, time equal to 100 seconds. After irradiation, the site will be thoroughly rinsed with saline.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  at least one implant with peri-implant inflammation that requires non-surgical
             treatment.

          -  Peri-implant diseases included are peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis

        Criteria for diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis or peri-implantitis:

          1. Red, swollen gingival tissues surrounding the implant

          2. Presence of bleeding and/or suppuration on gentle probing around the implant

          3. Increased probing depth compared to probing depth after restoration of the implant
             (greater than 2mm increase in probing depth)

          4. May or may not have progressive bone loss in relation to radiographic bone levels
             assessed either 1 year following restoration of the implant OR ≥3mm of radiographic
             bone loss from the implant platform -systemically healthy or with controlled common
             systemic conditions, such as hypertension, that will not affect wound healing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  current heavy smokers (&gt;10 cigarettes/day)

          -  have diabetes or other systemic diseases that may comprise healing

          -  take antibiotics within 3 months before the procedure
