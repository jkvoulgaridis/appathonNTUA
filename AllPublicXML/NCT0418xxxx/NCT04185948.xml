  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial attempts to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention
      combining intermittent fasting and the Mediterranean diet guidelines vs an comparative
      intervention combining intermittent fasting but using the UK dietary guidelines.

      Participants will be randomised to these intervention using a parallel design. Weight change
      and blood lipids will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      This study will have a randomised parallel study comparing two interventions involving
      intermittent fasting. One of the interventions will use the Mediterranean dietary guidelines
      proposed by the Mediterranean Diet Foundation, the other intervention will use the UK dietary
      guidelines (Eatwell Guide).

      In this study, the interventions will require participants to adopt these interventions for 4
      weeks. A basic website containing support information will be develop for each of these
      interventions.

      Baseline measurements will be taken at the start of the study. Blood samples will be obtained
      in a fasted state before and after 4-week study period.

      Anthropometric and body composition measurements including height and weight, waist
      circumference, bioelectrical impedance will be collected by researcher. Physical activity
      will be assessed using accelerometers.

    <description>For 4 weeks participants will be encouraged to adopt the Mediterranean dietary guidelines as recommended by the Mediterranean Diet Foundation in Barcelona, Spain. In combination with these guidelines, an intermittent fasting regime involving two days of the week will be implemented. The regime will encourage individuals to consume of 500kcal per day for women and 625kcal per day for men, resulting in 75% daily caloric restriction during each of these two days.</description>
