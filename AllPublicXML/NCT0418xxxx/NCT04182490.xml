  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of three dose cohorts of LMN-101 followed
      by campylobacter challenge. Subjects will begin taking their LMN-101 or placebo regimen 3x
      daily on Day -7. They will document AEs in a diary. After 1 wk of dosing, volunteers will be
      admitted to an inpatient clinical research facility as they continue the 28-day course of
      treatment. After 3 doses of LMN-101 or placebo, subjects will receive the C. jejuni challenge
      on Day 0 following an established campylobacter controlled human infection model (CHIM)
      protocol (Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Poly et al. 2008; Rimmer et al. 2018; Tribble et al.
      2009). After challenge, safety monitoring will include 24-hour inpatient clinical monitoring,
      vital signs at least TID (orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate as clinically indicated),
      daily medical interviews and physical exams, blood culture for fever ≥ 39 °C, and daily stool
      culture. Specific solicited adverse events include diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, mucoid or bloody stools, headache, fatigue, lack of
      appetite, muscle pain, chills, and joint pains. Stool output will be measured. Fluid losses
      will be replaced with oral rehydration or intravenously as clinically indicated.

      Subjects will begin taking a 5-day course of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin when they meet
      early treatment criteria or it has been 144 hours since the campylobacter challenge,
      whichever is earlier. Subjects will be discharged from the inpatient clinical research
      facility 48 hours after commencing antibiotics, when all symptoms have resolved or are
      resolving, and they have had ≥ 2 consecutive stools negative for C. jejuni. Subjects will be
      provided remaining azithromycin and ciprofloxacin to complete 5-day course at home, along
      with remaining doses of LMN-101 or placebo to be taken at home to complete the 28-day course.
      Subjects will be provided a diary card/memory aid and thermometer for outpatient monitoring
      of solicited adverse events. Subjects will be seen as outpatients on Days 14, 21, 28, 35, 56,
      and 84 after challenge for protocol-specified evaluations and contacted by telephone 6 months
      after challenge. For microbial recrudescence, extra visits to the clinic will be necessary
      and an additional course of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin will be given for 10 days.

      Healthy subjects will be randomized within one of the following sequential dose cohorts:

        -  LMN-101, six 500-mg capsules orally three times daily for 28 days (n=21), or
           identical-appearing placebo (n=7); or

        -  LMN-101, two 500-mg capsules and four 500-mg placebo capsules orally three times daily
           for 28 days (n=21), or identical-appearing placebo (n=7); or

        -  LMN-101, one 300-mg capsule and five 500-mg placebo capsules orally three times daily
           for 28 days (n=21), or identical-appearing placebo (n=7).

      Campylobacter jejuni CG8421, 1.5 x 10e5 colony-forming units challenge will be administered
      orally as a single challenge after 7 days of dosing.The C. jejuni CG8421 (capsule type 23,
      36) challenge strain lacks all ganglioside mimicry and the genes needed for synthesis of
      N-acetyl neuraminic acid, necessary for glycolipid mimicry associated with Guillain-Barré
      (Poly et al. 2008; Tribble et al. 2009).The C. jejuni challenge will be followed 144 hours
      later by antibiotics for 5 days. Earlier antibiotic treatment will be initiated if subjects
      meet the criteria to start antibiotics or have any illness that necessitates early treatment
      in the opinion of the study physician. Additional treatment will be given if microbial
      recrudescence is observed.
