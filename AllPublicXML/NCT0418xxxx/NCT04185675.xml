  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macintosh direct laryngoscope has been mostly widely used for anesthesiologists in operation
      rooms or emergency situations all over the world. With rapidly development of technical
      devices, nowadays videolaryngoscope has become more and more popular in hospitals, for it
      could improve first intubation success rate and it is easier for beginners to learn. And
      there are many different types of videolaryngoscope for different purpose, like with or
      without a channel, different curvature, and so go. In this study, our aim is to study whether
      the videolaryngoscope which can be adjustable or not costs less intubation time and causes
      fewer injury in expected non-difficult airway patients by experienced anesthesiologists,
      compared with the classic Macintosh direct laryngoscope.
