  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital anterior chest wall deformity, known to occur
      in 1:400 of new-borns. Complaints may be of cosmetic nature or as a consequence of
      (cardio)pulmonary impairment. Part of the current work-up of pectus excavatum patients in
      Zuyderland Medical Centre (Heerlen, the Netherlands) is visual documentation of the
      deformity. Visual documentation is performed utilising a single-reflex camera and consists of
      5 standard photographs (acquired from different angles) and two specialised recordings. These
      specialised recordings encompass a recording to measure the pectus excavatum's depth and a
      raster stereography recording to create a three-dimensional perspective. However, this form
      of visual documentation is not efficient, as it is time- and labor-intensive for the
      photographer and patient.

      Recently, another study started that aims to investigate whether three-dimensional (3D)
      optical surface scans can be used to determine pectus severity, as compared to chest
      radiographs and computed tomography scans (3DPECTUS study; METCZ20190048; NCT03926078).
      Building on this study it was determined whether 3D optical surface scans can be used as a
      tool to document the surface geometry of pectus excavatum. To determine whether the current
      standard photographs and specialised recordings can be replaced by a 3D scan, both methods
      are compared. To make this comparison, the pectus excavatum depth was chosen as an objective
      measure of agreement. If there is good agreement, it is assumed that the standard photos can
      be replaced by a 3D photo in the current work-up. This will subsequently result in a time
      saving as well as a reduced burden for the patient while acquisition of 3D scans takes only
      10 seconds.
