  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adolescents with obesity cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has become an important
      clinical examination providing valuable information with regard to the integrative exercise
      responses, including the pulmonary, cardiovascular and muscular systems.

      During CPET, mechanical constraints in ventilation, an elevated risk for hypoxia and
      chronotropic incompetence (CI) (defined as the inability of the heart to increase its rate
      with increased activity), or compromised cardiac function (e.g. lowered heart rate (HR)
      recovery, chronotropic index and stroke volume) are often observed in obese adults. Moreover,
      several studies regarding exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary responses to maximal
      endurance exercise testing have been performed in obese adolescents. Despite these previous
      investigations in obese adolescents it remains controversial whether cardiopulmonary
      disturbances can be observed consistently during CPET. However, a number of studies have
      reported a suboptimal response to exercise, in particular a reduced peak heart rate (HRpeak)
      and peak cycling power output (Wpeak). Adult obesity modifies cardiac behavior, including
      resting HR and CI, which has a marked effect on exercise capacity. Therefore, chronotropic
      variables are the most important factors that affect exercise performance. It has been shown
      that both peak and resting HR account for over forty percent of variability of exercise
      capacity. Interestingly, resting HR and HR response to exercise, including a blunted HR
      increase, low chronotropic index and HR recovery, are important predictors of all-cause
      mortality and cardiovascular death, at least in adults. These changes in HR during and
      recovery from CPET are mediated by the balance between sympathetic and vagal activity of the
      autonomic nervous system. Adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with the metabolic
      syndrome may be mediated by autonomic dysfunction, whereby obesity is characterized by
      sympathetic predominance and a decrease in vagal activity in the basal state, where reduced
      sympathetic responsiveness has been observed during exercise. Therefore, these multiple
      exercise risk markers could provide valuable clinical information regarding cardiometabolic
      health. Nonetheless HR behavior during CPET has not been described in obese adolescents. The
      goal of this study is to examine the HR behavior of obese adolescents during CPET to clarify
      whether this population suffer from CI.
