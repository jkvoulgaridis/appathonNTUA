  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being done to see if giving surfactant (CurosurfÂ®) will decrease the
      number of days that infants will need a breathing tube, decrease the days in the critical
      care unit and decrease the number of days needed in the hospital. The primary hypothesis for
      this study is that there will be fewer days needed on mechanical ventilation and improved
      lung compliance and pulmonary gas exchange.

      This study will enroll infants undergoing cardiothoracic surgery requiring deep hypothermic
      circulatory arrest (DHCA) at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital.
      Patients that are eligible will be randomized to receive either one dose surfactant or the
      sham (air) arm after the surgical procedure. Patients will be monitored for an additional 30
      days after the breathing tube is removed. It is possible that subjects may be discharged
      prior to the last assessment, therefore for subjects who have been discharged a member of the
      study team will contact the parent (s) or legal authorized representative by telephone.
