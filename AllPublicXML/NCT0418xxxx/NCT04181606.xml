  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that Esmolol hydrochloride, a beta-1 selective blocker,
      improves myocardial oxygen (O2) supply-demand balance at rest and during isometric (handgrip)
      stress in adults with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that infusion of Esmolol, a fast-acting β1 selective
      antagonist, will acutely improve oxygen (O2) supply to the heart during small muscle mass
      exercise in adults with and without peripheral artery disease (PAD). β1 selective antagonists
      (or &quot;β1 blockers&quot;) are used to lower heart rate and improve O2 supply-to-demand balance in
      patients with coronary artery disease. It was recently reported that coronary exercise
      hyperemia (in response to fatiguing handgrip or plantar flexion exercise) is attenuated in
      patients with PAD. Preliminary data further show that in healthy young subjects, Esmolol
      infusion lessens the rise in the rate pressure product (an index of myocardial O2 demand)
      during handgrip exercise without negatively affecting coronary artery blood velocity. The
      current project will evaluate how Esmolol infusion affects coronary blood velocity (an index
      of coronary blood flow) and myocardial demand at rest, during handgrip exercise, and during
      post-exercise cuff occlusion in 1) young healthy adults, 2) older healthy adults and 3) older
      adults with PAD. Understanding how beta-1 selective blockade influences coronary and systemic
      vascular function may aid in the development of therapies to reduce myocardial ischemia in
      this population, which is a population at heightened coronary event risk both at rest and
      during blood pressure-raising tasks.

    <masking_description>The participants, investigators, and data analysts (outcomes assessors) will be blinded to the treatment (drug) order. The care providers (research nurse and physician) will be aware of the treatment order for safety reasons i.e., they will be assessing heart rate, blood pressure and symptoms before, during, and after the infusion.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Coronary blood velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded continuously during the 2-3 hour study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Blood velocity in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery (coronary blood velocity, CBV, in cm/sec), an index of myocardial oxygen supply, will be measured using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (apical four-chamber view). The participant will lie on an exam bed in the supine or left lateral position. CBV will be calculated as the peak diastolic velocity (average of 3 or more cardiac cycles) as measured manually by Prosolv 3.0. Because coronary velocity waveforms will be quantified manually, the person who performs this analysis will be blinded to the treatment until all analyses are complete.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate pressure product</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded continuously during the 2-3 hour study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Rate pressure product, an index of myocardial oxygen demand, will be obtained by multiplying heart rate by systolic blood pressure. Heart rate will be measured using a three-lead EKG. Peripheral blood pressure will be measured using a finger blood pressure cuff (Finometer, FMS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arterial pulse wave velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded continuously during the 2-3 hour study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be measured by pressing a sensor (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical) against one of the participant's neck (carotid) arteries and against one of their groin (femoral) arteries. Carotid-to-femoral PWV, the non-invasive gold standard for assessing central arterial (aortic) stiffness, will be calculated by dividing the estimated distance between the carotid and femoral arteries (i.e. carotid artery to sternal notch + sternal notch to femoral artery) by the pulse transit time between the two sites.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Central blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Recorded continuously during the 2-3 hour study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral artery pressure waveforms will be recorded via applanation tonometry of the radial pulse in one wrist using using the SphygmoCor system (AtCor Medical). Peripheral artery pressure waveforms are then used to estimate central blood pressures (systolic, diastolic, and mean) using a generalized transfer function (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical).</description>
