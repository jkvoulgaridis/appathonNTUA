  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a single-blind, randomized and cross-over study to investigate and
      compare the acute effects of local vibration (LV) and whole-body vibration (WBV) applications
      on postural control in adult patients with ataxia.

      The study will be included in patients aged 18-50 years, including ataxia diagnosed by the
      neurologist and able to walk independently. Patients with pregnancy status, epilepsy,
      spasticity, implant / endoprosthesis / pacemaker, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,
      history of fracture in the last 6 months and other neurological diseases other than ataxia
      will not be included in the study. Between the applications, a washout period of one week
      will be given to each patient to apply both local and whole body vibrations. The order of
      application will be decided by the coin toss randomization method. Descriptive evaluations of
      the patients will be done with Mini-BESTest and Trunk Impairment Scale. Stability limits and
      postural sways (Bertec Balance Check ScreenerTM), gait time - distance characteristics
      (GAITRite), functional mobility skills (Timed Up and Go Test), and static balances (One Leg
      Stance Test) before, 1 minute after the application and 60 minutes after the application.

    <description>Local vibration will be sequentially applied to the bilateral gastrosoleus complex with the Vibrasens © device. Application, the largest part of the muscle, each limb 5'er for a total of 10 minutes, static semi-squat position will be done.
The vibration frequency is 80 Hz and the amplitude is 1 mm.</description>

    <description>Whole body vibration application will be done with Compex® Winplate device. During this application, patients will be asked to continue static semi-squat position with 5 minutes of vibration and then 5 minutes of vibration.Vibration frequency, 30 Hz amplitude will be selected 2 mm.</description>

    <description>Both the whole-body vibration application and the local vibration application will be applied to the patients in our cross-over study. Between the two applications will be given a washout period of one week. Patients will be evaluated both local and whole body vibration applications, 1 minute and 60 minutes after the end of the applications. After the evaluation, the patient will be rested in the sitting position until the evaluation at the 60th minute.</description>
