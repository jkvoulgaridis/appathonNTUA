      Prostate specific membrane antigen(PSMA) targeted therapy brings new hope to the patients
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we reported the safety
      and efficacy of 177 Lu -labeled PSMA ligand(PSMA-I＆T) in the treatment of mCRPC in
      Asianethics.

      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in older men with recent data .PSMA is a
      type II transmembrane glycoprotein，overexpressed up to 100 to 1000 times higher than normal
      prostate cells in prostate cancer cells and is correlated with higher-grade cancers,
      metastatic disease and hormone refractory disease. Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA (LuPSMA) is a
      novel and highly targeted systemic RLT for progressive mCRPC. Upon binding of LuPSMA to the
      cell membrane, endocytosis is triggered, concentrating the tumouricidal effects of the
      radioisotope activity internally within malignant cells.

      This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial. Patients will receive PRLT
      Treatment. The follow-up period was followed up to assess safety and effectiveness.
