             Japanese descent, have been born in Japan, and not lived outside of Japan for more
             than 5 years; with a body mass index between 18.5 and 28.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and a
             total body weight between 50 and 100 kg, inclusive; in good health, determined by no
             clinically significant findings from medical history, physical examination, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations
             at Screening and Check in as assessed by the investigator (or designee); and have a
             history of a minimum of 1 bowel movement per day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter
             absorption and/or excretion; poor peripheral venous access; participation in a
             clinical trial involving administration of an investigational drug in the past 90 days
             prior to dosing; subjects with exposure to significant diagnostic or therapeutic
             radiation or current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure monitoring
             within 12 months prior to Check-in; subjects who have participated in any clinical
             trial involving a radiolabeled investigational drug within 12 months prior to
             Check-in.
