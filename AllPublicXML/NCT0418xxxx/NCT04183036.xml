  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallstones in the common bile duct (CBD) may be asymptomatic but may lead to complications
      such as acute cholangitis or acute pancreatitis. EST is widely used for the treatment of bile
      duct gallstones. Despite its efficacy and improvements over time, EST is still associated
      with complications such as hemorrhage, perforation, pancreatitis, and permanent loss of
      function of the sphincter of Oddi (SO). Permanent loss of SO function can cause
      duodenobiliary reflux, bacterial colonization of the biliary tract, gallstone recurrence,
      cholangitis, and liver abscess.

      Endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) was first proposed in 1983 and it is now
      recognized as an alternative technique for the removal of CBD gallstones. The small balloon
      (diameter &lt;8 mm) is less invasive, reduces the occurrence of adverse effects, and preserves
      the SO function, but it has limitations in the presence of CBD gallstones ≥10 mm in diameter.
      EST combined with endoscopic papillary large-balloon dilation (EPLBD) has been introduced for
      patients with large gallstone, but EPLBD widens the distal common bile duct and still may
      cause SO function damage, partially or completely. Repairing the ampulla of Vater and SO may
      reduce the long-term complication rates, especially gallstone recurrence. Unfortunately, no
      efficient strategy has been proposed. The present pilot study aimed to examine the
      feasibility and efficiency of an innovative strategy named endoclip papilloplasty to repair
      the damaged ampulla and recover SO function. The advantage of this device is that it can be
      rotated clockwise or counterclockwise by turning the handle until the correct position is
      achieved. Another advantage is if the clip is not in desired position, it may be re-opened
      and repositioned. Once satisfying clip positioning is achieved, the clip can be firmly
      attached to the tissue by pulling the slider back until tactile resistance is felt in the
      handle.Briefly, the operator assessed the patulous biliary opening and ductal axis,
      positioned and adjusted eachendoclip in order to close the patulous opening

      In order to reduce PEP risk, a rectal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was administered
      30 minutes before the ERCP in all patients. As the standard of care at the study hospital,
      the patients swallowed 2% lidocaine hydrochloride gel for local pharyngeal anesthesia, and 10
      mg of diazepam were injected intramuscularly before ERCP. Anti-convulsants were not allowed.
      ERCP was performed in a standard manner using a side-viewing endoscope.

      After successful selective deep cannulation of the common bile duct with a guidewire, the
      guidewire was extracted, and SOM was performed before contrast agent was introduced to
      determine the margins of the choledocholithiasis.

      EST was performed, and the size of EST, which was large incision (incision to the full part
      of the ampulla) or long enough to ensure successful stone extraction, depended on the
      transverse diameter of the stones.

      After stones removal, a 7.5Fr×26 cm biliary plastic stent, which was a suspended overlong
      biliary stent formed from a nasobiliary drainage tube (Boston Scientific), was placed to
      ensure that the biliary duct would not be clipped during endoclip papillaplasty and to reduce
      duodenobiliary reflux during the next 3-week before follow-up.

      The investigators will recruit patients according to admission criteria and exclusion
      criteria. The participants underwent SOM before, immediately after EST, and 3 weeks after EST
      with endoclip papilloplasty. The participants were followed for 3 days during hospitalized.
      Complications including perforation, bleeding, and PEP were recorded. Blood routine,
      pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), and liver function (serum alanine aminotransferase,
      aspartate aminotransferase, r-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase) were tested
      at 4 and 24 h after ERCP. All participants were followed at 3 weeks. The stent will be
      romoved with Allis clamp 3 weeks after the procedure.Symptoms were examined and blood tests
      as above were repeated ahead of stents retrieval and sphincter of Oddi monitoring through
      duodenoscope.

    <description>Endoclip papilloplasty was performed to repair the Oddi sphincter using sterile repositionable hemostasis clipping device (Micro-tech (Nanjing), Co., Ltd.; stainless-steel). The operator positioned the clip and assessed the clip position and made sure the incision was clipped. Four to five endoclips were positioned in the incision in a zipper way from distal to proximal papillary sphincterotomy</description>
