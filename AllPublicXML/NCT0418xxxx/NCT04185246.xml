  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NH002 (Perflutren Lipid Microspheres) Injectable Suspension is an ultrasound contrast agent
      for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular (LV)
      chamber and to improve the delineation of the LV endocardial border. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 ascending doses of NH002.

    <measure>Left Ventricular Endocardial Border Delineation (LVEBD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Image data obtained pre-injection and within 10 minutes post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline on the left ventricular endocardial border delineation (LVEBD) score, defined using a standard 12-segment model, as assessed by the blinded central reader(s). The left ventricular (LV) endocardium of the 4- or 2- chamber apical views are divided into 6 segments, with 2 basal, mid- and apical segments in each view. For each segment, LVEBD is graded as follows: 0= inadequate border (border not visible); 1= sufficient (border barely visible); 2= good (border clearly visible). A total delineation score (0-24) is obtained by adding the scores from the 6 individual segments in each of the 2 views.
The changes from baseline on LVEBD score of subjects with suboptimal LVEBD at baseline, as defined by 2 or more contiguous segments of 6 segments that cannot be visualized reliably in either the apical 4 and/or the 2-chamber view, as assessed by the blinded central reader(s)</description>

    <description>A duration of clinically useful contrast calculated by measuring the time between the disappearance of shadowing effect (useful effect starts) and the time when moderate or full LV enhancement and contrast enhancement are no longer adequate (useful effect ends), as assessed by the blinded central reader(s)</description>
