  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
      (GLE/PIB) regimen in adolescent participants aged 12 to &lt;18 years of age with chronic
      hepatitis C (CHC) in clinical practice in the Russian Federation. The study also plans to
      assess effectiveness of GLE/PIB in subpopulations of interest like co-infected hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) adolescents, in various HCV
      genotype/subgenotype, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic participants, treatment-experienced (prior
      treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) or IFN, and/or Ribavirin (RBV) and/or sofosbuvir
      [PRS]) and treatment-na√Øve, adolescents who use drugs (PWUD) and non-drug users.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>
