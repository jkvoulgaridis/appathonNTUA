  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-term circulatory support (ECMO/ECLS) has become a common emergency resuscitation
      support.

      Currently, the indication of the ECMO/ECLS relies more on clinic, biological and imagery
      arguments than on a real consensus.During the care of a patient under ECMO/ECLS, various
      stakeholders are involved in the implementation and its medical and paramedical management.
      Everyone, with their knowledge and experience, has an opinion on the relevance of this
      therapy.

      A validated questionnaire, translated from an Anglo-Saxon study, will be used as a basis for
      work and adapted. After the publication of a memo, it is accessible anonymously on a platform
      (ASKABOX) whose link is distributed by email by the secretaries or nursing staff. The city
      and the exercise service will be requested in the preamble of the questionnaire. It is
      composed of six demographic questions: age, gender, occupation, participation in emergency
      care, number of ECMOs encountered, level of knowledge about ECMO. The other questions concern
      concrete ECMO situations and the answers are nuanced from definitely yes to definitely no to
      allow professionals to express their opinion as well as possible. The targeted professionals
      are all those involved in the management of patients on ECMO: emergency physicians,
      anesthesiologists, surgeons, perfusionists, nurses, orderlies, ASHs.

      A monocentric feasibility study was carried out with satisfactory results in terms of
      participation.

      AN INFORMATION NOTE WILL BE ATTACHED WITH THE EMAIL AND THE LINK FOR THE QUESTIONNAIRE
      (ANONYMOUS)
