  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) suffer from an excess risk of adverse cardiovascular
      events. Recently, two classes of glucose lowering agents, namely SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)
      and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), have proved superior to placebo in protecting T2D
      patients from cardiovascular events in dedicated trials. Patient populations in such trials
      were mainly composed of T2D individuals with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at
      very high risk for CVD. In addition, no clinical trial has so far compared cardiovascular
      outcomes of T2D associated with SGLT2i versus GLP-1RA. In addition, whether different results
      would incur in patients at lower CVD risk is unclear. On this basis, we designed this
      retrospective real-world study to compare cardiovascular outcomes of patients newly treated
      with SGLT2i versus GLP-1RA in routine clinical practice
