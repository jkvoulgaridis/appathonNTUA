  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well acalabrutinib works in treating patients with mantle
      cell lymphoma that cannot tolerate ibrutinib. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) at the end of 3 cycles of acalabrutinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients that are progression free without any of the
      following toxicities at the end of 3 cycles:

      Ia. Recurrence of intolerable toxicities previously noted on ibrutinib. Ib. The occurrence of
      intolerable toxicities related to acalabrutinib defined as: grade 4 neutropenia or
      thrombocytopenia lasting greater than 7 days or any grade &gt;= 3 non-hematologic toxicity as
      assessed by the investigator to be related to study drug).

      II. To determine the efficacy of acalabrutinib, progression free survival (PFS) and duration
      of response (DOR) in patients.

      III. To assess the safety profile of acalabrutinib in patient's intolerant to ibrutinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Sequential peripheral blood (PB)/plasma/tissue fine-needle aspiration (FNA) will be stored
      for evaluation of:

      Ia. Clonal evolution with targeted sequencing (seq) and/or whole exome sequencing (WES) in
      sequential samples.

      Ib. Pattern of mutation changes with acalabrutinib. Ic. Response predictors - mutations,
      cytokine-chemokines. Id. Minimal residual disease (MRD) assay using flow cytometry (FC) and
      circulating tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) analysis.

      Ie. Sequential immunologic studies with cytokines/chemokines, T cells and immunoglobulins.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 years, then annually for up to 3 years.
