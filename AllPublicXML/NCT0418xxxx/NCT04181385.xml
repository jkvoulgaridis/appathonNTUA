  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical antipsychotics are pharmaceutical drugs used to treat schizophrenia. Common side
      effects are weight gain, insulin resistance, and abnormal blood lipids. This increases the
      risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in patients taking these drugs. In
      particular, olanzapine is a highly effective therapy for schizophrenia but is commonly
      associated with metabolic disturbances. It has previously been shown that the negative
      effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism occur even after a single dose,
      independently of weight gain. These effects may be mediated by blocking the dopamine (D2)
      receptor. In this study the research team is investigating whether a single dose of
      olanzapine alters postprandial lipid metabolism after a high-fat drink. Olanzapine
      administered along with the high-fat drink will be compared to placebo or olanzapine plus
      bromocriptine (an activator of the D2 receptor).

      Postprandial lipid and hormonal responses are being investigated in up to 15 individuals.
      Participants are their own control in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.
      Participants are admitted after an overnight fast. Participants will consume a high-fat drink
      (50g of fat) along with either oral placebo, olanzapine (10mg) or olanzapine (10mg) plus
      bromocriptine (5mg). Study visits occur 2-4 weeks apart with the three treatments applied in
      random order. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and regular intervals after the
      treatments for up to 8 hours to measure glucose, insulin, triglycerides, fatty acids and
      other hormones/metabolites.
