  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an First in Human (FIH) Phase I/II, multinational, multicenter, open-label study of
      HB-201 monotherapy and HB-201 &amp; HB-202 combination therapy in patients with HPV 16+ confirmed
      cancers comprising two parts: Phase I Dose Escalation and Phase II Dose Expansion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I Dose Escalation will comprise two treatment groups (Groups 1 and 2) of HB-201
      monotherapy and two treatment groups (Groups 3 and 4) of HB-201 &amp; HB-202 dual drug regimen.
      Group 1 and Group 2 Phase I Dose Escalation will determine a safe recommended Phase II dose
      (RP2D) of HB- 201 for intravenous (IV) and intratumoral (IT) treatment. Group 3 and Group 4
      Phase I Dose Escalation will determine a safe RP2D of HB-202 for IV.

      The Phase II Dose Expansion may have up to six treatment groups (Groups A to F). Groups A
      will consist of HB-201 monotherapy administered IV , Group B will consist of HB-201
      monotherapy administered IV in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor ; Group C will
      consist of HB-201 monotherapy as an IT administration for the first dose, followed by HB-201
      monotherapy as an IV administration; Group D will be Sequential and alternating
      administrations of HB-202 IV and HB-201 IV; Group E will be sequential and alternating
      administrations of HB-202 IV and HB-201 IV with an immune checkpoint inhibitor; Group F will
      be the administration of HB-201 monotherapy IT for the first dose, followed by a sequential
      alternating administration of HB-202 IV and HB-201 IV.

        Exclusion Criteria

        All Patients:

          1. Patients with untreated and/or symptomatic metastatic central nervous system (CNS)
             disease. However, patients with brain/CNS metastases who have undergone surgery or
             radiotherapy, whose disease is stable and who have been on a stable dose of
             corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first

          2. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment
             administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive study treatment, or
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results. This includes clinically
             significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease, including cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke and myocardial infarction less than six months prior to enrollment,

          3. Concurrent malignancy that is clinically significant or requires active intervention
             at the time of Screening (with the exception of adequately treated, basal or squamous
             cell carcinoma, non melanomatous skin cancer), unless agreed otherwise between the

             fatigue that have not resolved to Grade 1 or baseline prior to the first
             administration of study treatment. Patients with toxicities attributed to systemic
             prior anticancer therapy, which are not expected to resolve and result in long lasting
             sequelae, such as neuropathy or ototoxicity after platinum-based therapy, are
             permitted to enroll.

             antibody but negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) are permitted to enroll.

         14. Known history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Testing for the human
             immunodeficiency virus is not mandatory.

         15. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that would, in the
             Investigator's judgment, contraindicate participation in this study.
