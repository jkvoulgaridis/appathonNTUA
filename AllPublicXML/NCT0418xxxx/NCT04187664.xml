  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High risk surgical patients are subject to complications that impact rehabilitation time,
      overall mortality and costs. This project proposes the creation of a post-surgery care
      pathway called Extended Care in High-Risk Surgical Patients (EXCARE) in the form of
      coordinated multiprofessional actions dedicated to high-risk non-cardiac surgical patients
      with the aim of improving the postoperative outcomes. The proposed pathway comprises a range
      of actions that include individual patient-centered risk assessment by the Anaesthesia and
      Perioperative Medicine Service (SAMPE) Risk Model (30-day probability of death), specialized
      care in Post-Anesthetic and Intensive Care Units (ICU), and also in the surgical wards
      performed by the nursing, anesthesia, clinic and surgery teams.

      This is a quasi-experiment in which the clinical effectiveness of the extended care will be
      analyzed using a before-and-after comparison, the primary outcome being 30-day surgical
      mortality and postoperative complications at day 7 defined by PostOperative Morbidity Survey
      (POMS), a reliable and valid survey of short-term postoperative morbidity in major elective
      surgery. POMS domains evaluated are: pulmonary, infectious, renal, gastrointestinal,
      cardiovascular, neurological, haematological and wound complications.

      Secondary outcomes include 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay, number of Rapid
      Response Team calls, unplanned postoperative ICU admission, surgical reintervention, failure
      to rescue and hospital readmission. High-sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) levels will be
      measured before surgery and daily until 48 hours postoperatively to identify patients with
      myocardial injury (defined as any hs-cTn concentration greater than the 99th-percentile upper
      reference limit).

      Study Strengths and Limitations: This is the first study to evaluate the implementation of
      surgical patient stratification using the SAMPE Risk Model, pioneering the creation of a
      multidisciplinary care pathway that involves nursing and medical teams, and can be
      consolidated as a future standard of assistance. The care bundle, using an objective risk
      communication tool, is expected to integrate the teams involved in the perioperative care,
      reducing the fragmentation of care and, consequently, postoperative complications. The study
      is designed to use historical controls (before and after) and is therefore inherently
      vulnerable to the biases of this design. It will be conducted in a single teaching hospital
      and referral centre that provides care to patients from across southern Brazil through the
      national unified health system centre, which can therefore limit its external validity.
