      A Single Ascending Dose (SAD; Part A) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD; Part B) Phase 1 Study
      of LB-102 N-Methyl amisulpride) in healthy volunteers. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the safety and the tolerability of a single oral dose (SAD) and multiple oral doses (MAD) of
      LB-102 as compared to placebo. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of LB-102.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of LB-102 in healthy subjects. The study will
      consist of two parts: Part A - Single Ascending Dose and Part B - Multiple Ascending Doses.
      There will be 5 cohorts in Part A and 3 Cohorts in Part B of this study. Each cohort consists
      of 8 subjects, with 6 subjects assigned to LB-102 and 2 subjects assigned to placebo.

      In Parts A and B, eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 (pre-dose) to placebo (n=2)
      or LB-102 (n=6). Eligible subjects will receive 1 dose on Day 1 (Part A) or 13 doses on Days
      1-7 (Part B) of placebo or LB-102.

          5. Subjects must be in good general health as determined by medical history and physical
             examination with no clinically significant medical findings and no history of
             significant medical disease (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, etc.) or acute
             condition with the past 30 days.

             after stopping the investigational product. Female subjects using oral contraception
             whose partner consistently uses condoms or who is vasectomized is also acceptable.

          8. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or practicing at least one method of
             contraception, from initial study drug administration through 90 days after

          9. Male subjects must agree to abstain from sperm donation through 90 days after
             administration of the last dose of investigational drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          1. Are pregnant or lactating.

          2. Have a history or presence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, or neurological disorders which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risk of the study drug or may confound the interpretation
             of study measures.

          3. Clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination, vital signs, or ECG.

          4. History or presence of psychiatric or neurological disease or condition.

          5. History of seizures.

          6. Subject with any history or current evidence of suicidal behavior.

          8. Recent history of alcohol or drug abuse (within the last two years).

          9. Any use of tobacco or tobacco-containing products (cigarettes, pipes, etc.) within one
             month prior to screening.

         10. Have a history of blood donation in excess of 500 mL of blood within 30 days prior to
             Screening.

         11. Have received treatment with an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to

         12. Use of any prescription or over the counter medication, herbal medications, vitamins,
             or supplements within 14 days prior to study drug administration.

         13. Have a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies 1 and 2,
             Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C antibody.

         14. Any subject who is known to be allergic to the study drug or any components of the
             study drug.
