  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At level 3 conditionally automated, the vehicle ensures driving and the driver disengages
      from driving to perform another activity independent of driving (ex: read a book, play on his
      phone ....). However, drivers are expected to be available to take over control for the case
      of system failure or limitation. This take-over control must take place in a limited time,
      very short, of the order of a few seconds. To take-over control of the vehicle quickly and
      efficiently, the driver must be, at the time of take-over, vigilant, efficient, and attentive
      to the environment and focused on the take-over of manual driving. Predicting the driver's
      reengagement capabilities to ensure that the driver will be able to take-over control of the
      vehicle is crucial at level 3 of autonomous driving.

      The objective of ANTIDOTE is to determine physiological and behavioural parameters capable of
      predicting the take-over quality in level 3 conditionally automated vehicles in a simulated
      highway driving situation in healthy drivers or drivers with attention disorders.

      At level 3 conditionally automated, the vehicle ensures driving and the driver disengages
      from driving to perform non-related driving tasks (ex: read a book, play on his phone ....).
      However, drivers are expected to be available to take over control for the case of system
      failure or limitation. This take-over control must take place in a limited time, very short,
      of the order of a few seconds. To take-over control of the vehicle quickly and efficiently,
      the driver must be, at the time of take-over, vigilant, efficient, and attentive to the
      environment and focused on the take-over of manual driving. Predicting the driver's
      reengagement capabilities to ensure that the driver will be able to take-over control of the
      vehicle is crucial at level 3 of autonomous driving.

      In this context, the objective of ANTIDOTE is to determine physiological and behavioural
      parameters capable of predicting the take-over quality in level 3 conditionally automated
      vehicles in a simulated highway driving situation.

      This study will examine how engagement will impact take-over control quality in 6 non-driving
      related secondary tasks. A driving simulator study will be conducted and data from a total of
      32 healthy drivers and 16 drivers with attention disorders will be used to evaluate take-over
      quality.

      Electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG, respiration) and behavioral data will be recorded
      before, during and after the take-over control.

    <description>Quality of driving take-over behaviour (Good/bad) will be assessed by collision (collision or driving off the road) and critical encounters (Time To Collision).
Time to collision (TTC) refers to the time required for the vehicle to collide with the stationary obstacle obstructing the driving lane if it continues at its speed at the time it changes to the next lane completely.
Good : no collision AND TTC &gt;= 1.5 secondes Bad : collision or no collision AND TTC &lt; 1.5 secondes</description>

    <description>The volunteers will be placed in a driving simulator that will simulate autonomous highway driving. This autonomous driving will be interrupted by take-over requests related to events that disrupt autonomous driving. During autonomous driving, the driver will have to disengage from driving by performing non-related driving tasks. During each non-related driving tasks, a take-over request will be sent. Electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG, respiration) and behavioural data will be recorded before, during and after the take-over control.</description>
