  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the incidence of allergic manifestations (the first of which is
      atopic dermatitis) and infectious diseases in children fed with an infant formula under real
      conditions of use.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the cumulative incidence of atopic
      dermatitis in healthy infants at risk for dysbiosis at 12 months of age and to identify
      factors associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis.
