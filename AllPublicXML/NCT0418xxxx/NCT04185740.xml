  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up till now, dopaminergic replacement is considered as the gold standard for the symptomatic
      treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the intake, especially
      higher doses when taken for a longer duration, are associated with several side effects
      including response fluctuations. These fluctuations in medication response are often
      characterized by a wearing-OFF period, also defined as the recurrence of PD symptoms before a
      patient should take the next dose of medication. The duration of test sessions during
      research experiments (e.g. in the field of rehabilitation) can interfere with the period of
      the optimal therapeutic effect of dopaminergic medication, influencing outcomes of a study.
      Therefore, the objective of this project is to get more insight in the measurability of
      ON-OFF fluctuations by testing the applicability of a short and simple timed tapping task
      (TTT) on a smartphone in rehabilitation research studies. The assessment can be useful for
      future clinical studies in PD where a precise estimation of medication is indispensable for
      accurate research outcomes.

    <description>The TTT, consisting of two targets, will be presented on the screen of the smartphone. Participants will be instructed to alternate between the two targets using their index finger for 30 seconds. The task will always be performed with the left hand first and then with the right hand. The touch-sensitive screen of the smartphone will measure the timing of each touch event, its duration, the coordinates on the phone screen and the amount of pressure applied.</description>
