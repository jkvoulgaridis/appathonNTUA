  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of obesity. The availability of a
      default option (i.e., option a consumer selects if no active choice is made) has been shown
      to effectively nudge consumer behavior. An online default option (i.e., prefilled grocery
      shopping cart) was previously shown to positively impact the food purchases of individuals
      with food insecurity.The present study aims to extend these findings bye examining efficacy
      of an online default option in enhancing the nutritional quality of online grocery purchases
      in individuals with food insecurity over the course of a month.

    <textblock>
      Food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of obesity and weight-related illnesses.
      The present study is the first longitudinal randomized control trial to examine if an online
      prefilled grocery shopping cart (i.e., a default cart) nudges individuals with food
      insecurity to purchase healthier groceries compared to receiving nutrition education.

      It was hypothesized that the prefilled online grocery shopping cart (i.e., default condition)
      will result in a significant improvement in the nutritional quality of groceries purchased
      compared to those receiving nutrition education.

      Thirty-eight food pantry users recruited from food pantries in New York in 2018 were enrolled
      in the present study and were given $48.50 to purchase groceries weekly using an online
      grocery website for five weeks. At baseline, participants were instructed to purchase
      groceries keeping in mind nutrition, cost, and taste. For the subsequent four weeks (T1-T4),
      participants were randomized to receive 1) nutrition education or 2) a prefilled online
      grocery shopping cart that met their nutritional needs based on age and sex (Default).

      Our primary nutritional outcomes included HEI scores, calories (kcal), and energy density
      (kcal/grams).

    <description>Participants in the default condition were presented with a pre-filled online shopping cart containing a combination of groceries that meet macro- and micronutrient requirements for their gender and age, and told that they are free to delete, add, and exchange any item they wish to finalize their selections.</description>

    <description>The default option is a behavioral economics construct that refers to the option a consumer selects if no active choice is made (e.g. opt-out 401K plans, which significantly increase enrollment, compared to active sign up). Participants in the default condition were presented with a prefilled online shopping cart containing groceries that met nutritional requirements based on participants' gender and age.</description>
