  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operational Stress Injuries (OSIs), including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are
      prevalent among veterans deployed in recent combat missions, the effects of which are
      experienced within their families. The development of evidence-based programs for veterans
      with OSIs and their families is critical because family functioning both affects and is
      affected by OSIs. Few programs have been implemented, however, particularly in Canada, and
      those that have are not evaluated. Research suggests that brief, systems-focused family
      psychoeducation programs are useful in the treatment of OSIs, specifically PTSD, leading to
      increases in targeted PTSD knowledge and skills and enhancing resilience.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to: (1) develop a systems-focused, psychoeducational
      program designed to enhance resilience in veterans with OSIs receiving clinical care at an
      OSI clinic in Atlantic Canada and their families; (2) to implement the program with veterans
      and their families at the OSI clinic; (3) to evaluate the efficacy of the program; and (4) to
      compare resilience-building family psychoeducation to the standard information-providing
      services currently available to families at the OSI clinic. Results will be shared within the
      network of OSI clinics in Canada and will inform the development of a proposal for a
      mixed-method study.

      Context

      The capacity of military and veteran families to develop and maintain positive mental health
      and well-being is challenged by contemporary operational imperatives. Since 1990, the
      Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has engaged in more than 20 major international operations,
      involving multiple rotations of members serving in complex missions including Rwanda, Bosnia,
      Afghanistan, and, more recently, Mali. The intensified operational tempo is associated with
      an increase in the prevalence of operational stress injuries (OSIs). OSIs are persistent
      psychological difficulties resulting from operational duties performed while serving in the
      CAF. OSIs span a spectrum, including diagnosed psychiatric conditions such as anxiety
      disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as other conditions
      that may be less severe, but still interfere with daily functioning. In a recent iteration of
      the Life After Service Study (LASS), a national survey of CAF veterans receiving services
      from Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), 23% reported a diagnosis of one or more mental disorders,
      5.8% reported suicidal ideation, and 1.1% reported a suicide attempt in the previous year.
      Specialized OSI clinics are now in place to support treatment-seeking veterans who qualify
      for care through VAC. An increase in mental health diagnoses requiring clinical management in
      these clinics has been documented.

      The effects of OSIs in members and veterans ripple through their families. Results of a
      recent study focusing on the impacts of OSIs on the mental health and well-being of families
      of CAF veterans suggest that the imperative to care for the veteran becomes the central,
      organizing facet of family experience. In response, family structure, including family role
      redefinition and reallocation, shifts. Spouses assume full responsibility for family
      functioning and adapt routines, as required, while providing care to the veteran. Some
      spouses describe themselves as caregivers to the veteran, performing daily work that involves
      mediating and buffering the internal and external stresses affecting him/her. Consequently,
      spouses report burn out and specific health conditions attributed to the stress emerge. These
      health outcomes develop in an environment characterized by loss of identity and social and
      geographic isolation for some. Emotional stress, relationship tensions, and financial
      concerns resulting from changes in employment impact the whole family. Throughout, family
      members must reconcile the loss of the veteran as he/she once was. In some cases, children
      share these burdens, enacting role behavior incompatible with their developmental stage.
      Children may also experience emotional and behavioural problems.

      Some veteran families cope with these challenges successfully, developing resilience through
      practical task management, problem-solving, and social support. Family resilience results
      from the interplay of individual assets and the social contexts in which they develop.
      Maintaining shared family beliefs, facilitating family organization, and communicating are
      processes that facilitate resilience through stress and adversity. Maintaining shared beliefs
      helps family members make sense of stress and adversity. Shared beliefs can be introduced or
      reintroduced to the family system through religious, spiritual practice, artistic expression,
      or through connection with family rituals or the natural environment. Furthermore, some
      research suggests that agency and self-determination are mobilized through shared belief
      systems and are instrumental in efforts to reinterpret adversity as a challenge that can be
      mastered.

      Family organization enables families to manage the impacts of OSIs on both the veteran and
      the family system. Clear and consistent organizational patterns reassure family members,
      particularly vulnerable family members such as children, that, notwithstanding the adversity
      and stress, the structure of the family is continuous, dependable, and strong.

      Communication processes are also important in resilient families. Clear and unambiguous
      messages, empathetically and openly shared, encourage inclusion, collaborative
      problem-solving, and conflict resolution.

      For families experiencing adversity, such as the stresses associated with supporting a
      veteran living with an OSI, resilience processes enable families to recover or &quot;bounce back&quot;
      by developing &quot;resistance to psychosocial risk experiences&quot; or to reconfigure by &quot;bouncing
      forward&quot; as new capacities are developed. Resilience is not innate or merely a function of
      individual personality traits. Rather, it can be learned and developed.

      Brief, systems-focused psychoeducational programs have the potential to support the
      development of veteran family resilience. These programs enhance individual and relational
      capacities that reduce psychological and relational distress. The tools required to navigate
      interconnected systems (informal and formal social networks) can also be acquired. Early
      identification of issues and enhancement of help-seeking behaviours are the focus of
      psychoeducational programs. They are a complement to therapy, not a replacement. Indeed,
      brief, systems-focused programs attract and retain families in need who are unlikely to seek
      out therapeutic intervention and have a significant role to play in addressing their complex
      needs.

      To date, evidence-based, psychoeducational programs for veterans with OSIs and their families
      are few in number, particularly in Canada. Some research is ongoing in the United States. For
      example, the efficacy of psychoeducation for veterans with OSIs and their families was
      measured in an American study involving 100 veterans with PTSD and 96 family members
      participating in a longitudinal evaluation of a program entitled REACH (Reaching out to
      Educate and Assist Caring, Healthy Families). Results indicate that participation in REACH
      positively impacts both veterans with PTSD and their family members. Participants showed
      improvements in knowledge about PTSD, family adaptation strategies, family communication, and
      empowerment. Relationship satisfaction, perceived social support, and a decrease in PTSD
      symptoms were also reported.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to contribute to the development of evidence-based,
      systems-focused psychoeducational programming for CAF veterans with OSIs and their families.
      This initiative will draw upon partnerships and expertise at an OSI Clinic in Atlantic
      Canada.

      Theoretical Framework

      This pilot program will be developed as a brief, systems-focused psychoeducational program.
      Therefore, the ecological family systems theory will serve as a foundation for the
      development of the content of the pilot program and its evaluation. Grounded in a
      bioecological model of human development, the original ecological family systems model and
      its subsequent iterations bring into view a system of four interconnected environments
      (microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem), each representing the interdependent
      contexts embodied in the lives of individuals and families. These environments and their
      roles in developing and maintaining resilience will constitute program components. For
      example, loss of identity, shared beliefs, role redefinition/reallocation (microsystem),
      changes in routines, caregiving imperatives, family organization strategies (mesosystem),
      military and veteran family policies (exosystem), and military culture (macrosystem) and the
      processes integral to navigating these interconnected systems will be explored. The
      non-normative changes in roles and environments, or the ecological transitions, particular to
      the military context that challenge resilience for the families of veterans with OSIs will
      also be considered.

      Methodology

      CCAF veterans diagnosed with an OSI at least one year prior to the start of the study and
      receiving care through the OSI Clinic in Dartmouth, N.S. and their family members will be
      recruited to participate in the pilot program and its evaluation. Two six-week sessions will
      be implemented at the clinic - the first in January/February of 2020 and the second in the
      spring of 2020. A maximum of 10-15 participants (including both veterans and their family
      members) will be recruited for each group. Family members are defined as spouses/partners,
      siblings, parents, and adult children. Prior to the start of the program, participants will
      be qualitatively interviewed by a member of the research team. Participants will take part in
      interviews guided by questions informed by the ecological family systems theory. Program
      participants will be interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide; see interview guide
      included in attached appendices. Interviews will be taped and transcribed verbatim. Field
      notes identifying observations, thoughts, and additional information contributing to the
      formative analysis of the data will be maintained.

      Each of the weekly sessions will take place at the OSI clinic and will be led by at least two
      trained facilitators (one from the research team, and one member of the OSI clinical staff
      team). Each of these sessions will focus on providing education of different topics relevant
      to those accessing services at the clinic (e.g., types of treatments available, tools to
      support families, self care). See attached appendix for draft outline of group sessions. The
      facilitators will also be there to support the participants with any questions they may have.
      The OSI clinical team member facilitating these groups will also be able to meet individually
      with the client outside of the group as needed to provide additional support.

      At the end of each six-week session, program outcomes will be assessed qualitatively by a
      member of the research team utilizing the same interview guide as mentioned above. Six weeks
      after the end of the session, participants will be interviewed again as a final follow-up.
