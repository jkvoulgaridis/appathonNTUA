  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty(TKA) is a successful orthopedic surgery with excellent clinical
      outcome and survival. However, there are concerns about patient satisfaction in previous
      reports, and dissatisfaction rate of 15-30% is reported in clinical outcomes(PROMs) of some
      studies. Therefore, for improving the patient's outcome and satisfaction after total knee
      arthroplasty, it is necessary to change the design of the conventional total knee
      arthroplsaty implant. The knee is a joint structure with several dynamic functions, and not
      only the skeletal structure but also the soft tissue balance plays an important role in the
      function of the knee joint. New implants are being developed to overcome the limitations of
      conventional TKA implant, including the Journey II Bi-cruciate substituting total knee system
      (JII-BCS; Smith &amp; Nephew). JII-BCS implant has normal articular geometry, more anatomical
      femoral shape, lateral tibial convex geometry, and asymmetrical tibial plateau, anterior and
      posterior cams, which has been shown in experimental studies to produce nearly normal knee
      movement by reproducing the actual normal anatomical alignment in vivo. The clinical results
      of the kinematic effects of this anatomcally aligned change are insufficient, and there is
      also a lack of comparative studies with conventional total knee arthroplasty implant. The
      purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between anatomically aligned TKA(JII-BCS) and
      conventional TKA(Legion total knee system, Smith &amp; Nephew). This study is a randomized
      controlled study in patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty. A patient will
      undergo unilateral TKA with anatomically aligned or conventional TKA implant. The implant is
      determined using a random number table. Radiologic parameter, patients preference and
      clinical results was investigated in patients who received unilateral TKA during minimum 2
      year follow up.
