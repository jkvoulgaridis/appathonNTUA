  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is a common disease in the East Asia. During the
      disease course, 20%-50% patients suffered portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), which is
      characterized with poor outcome and low response for treatments. Although BCLC (Barcelona
      clinical liver cancer) system recommend to palliative targeted treatment, the East Asian
      countries recommend to resection or transartery artery chemoembolization (TACE).

      Recently, FOLFOX (Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil) based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy
      (HAIC) exhibited high response rate for advanced HCC.

      Pilot study showed TACE combined HAIC (TACE-HAIC) had better tumor response, with low
      progression disease rate.

      Whether TACE-HAIC would improve survival for patients with PVTT is need to further to study.
      A randomized clincal trial compared neo-TACE-HAIC with surgery versus surgery alone is aimed
      to answer this question.
