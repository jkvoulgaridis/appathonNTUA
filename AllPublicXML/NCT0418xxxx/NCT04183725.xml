      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety of Reduning injection for the
      treatment of influenza in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) injection was verified by
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of Reduning injection in the treatment of influenza in
      children, so as to provide more therapeutic programs for the treatment of influenza in
      children and provide clinical research evidence for clinical medication.In this study, a
      parallel control, randomized, double-blind,multi-center trial will be used to design the
      optimal efficacy of positive drugs.The time of body temperature that return normal was taken
      as the main therapeutic index.According to the formula of mean superiority test,the number of
      sample was calculated to 240 cases, with 120 cases in each experimental group and control
      group.The experimental group was treated with Reduning injection and Oseltamivir phosphate
      granule simulants, while the control group was treated with Oseltamivir phosphate granules
      and Reduning injection simulants .Each group will be treated for 5 days.Primary outcome
      measure this study was mainly from one dimension:Time of temperature recovery.Secondary
      outcome measures include the time when the fever begins to subside,the time of disease to
      alleviate,the degree of disease remission,disappearance rate of individual symptoms,
      etc.Before and after treatment,the temperature of each group was observed.
