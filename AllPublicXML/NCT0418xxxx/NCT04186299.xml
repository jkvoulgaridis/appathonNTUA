  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Articaine/epinephrine and lidocaine/epinephrine are the most common routine local anesthetic
      agents currently used in dentistry. However, their anesthetic efficacy and pain control in
      patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis via inferior alveolar nerve block is very
      low. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of clonidine versus
      articaine/epinpephrine as a local anesthetic agent for a buccal infiltration after IANB
      administration with lidocaine for (1) successful IANB, (2) hemodynamic stability, and (3)
      reducing dental anxiety for endodontic treatment in mandibular molars diagnosed with
      symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.

      Articaine/epinephrine and lidocaine/epinephrine are the most common routine local anesthetic
      agents currently used in dentistry. However, their anesthetic efficacy and pain control in
      patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis via inferior alveolar nerve block is very
      low. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of clonidine versus
      articaine/epinpephrine as a local anesthetic agent for a buccal infiltration after IANB
      administration with lidocaine for (1) successful IANB, (2) hemodynamic stability, and (3)
      reducing dental anxiety for endodontic treatment in mandibular molars diagnosed with
      symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. 100 patients with first or second mandibular molars
      diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis will be enrolled. Patients will randomly
      receive either 1.7mL of clonidine (1:100,000) or 1.7mL of 4% articaine with epinephrine
      (1:100,000) using buccal infiltration technique after administration of 1.7mL of 2% lidocaine
      with epinephrine (1:100,000) using an IANB technique. 15 minutes after injection, lip
      numbness will be checked. Those who reported lip numbness will be checked for pulpal
      anesthesia. Those who achieve profound pulpal anesthesia will be included in the study.
      Patient's pain score will be recorded using a Heft-Parker visual analog scale before, during
      and after endodontic treatment. Success in IANB is defined as no or mild pain upon endodontic
      access cavity preparation and initial canal instrumentation. The hemodynamic parameters and
      pain management will be measured before and after root canal treatment with specific
      intervals. Patient's dental anxiety level will be measured by VAS-Anxiety preoperatively,
      before IANB administration, before endodontic treatment and after the treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of success of IANB</measure>
    <time_frame>The pain level is recorded as the extent of access is achieved within dentin and while entering the pulp chamber or during initial file placement. Data of each patient will be recorded through study completion, an average of 4 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be instructed to rate any pain felt during the procedure. If they feel pain, the treatment will be stopped immediately and they rate their pain using the Heft-Parker Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The success of the IANB is defined as the ability to penetrate dentin, enter the pulp and advance instruments into the coronal part of the canal pulp without pain or with mild pain. The VAS consists of four categories of scales on a 170mm VAS line. No pain corresponds to 0mm. Mild pain is defined as greater than 0mm and less than or equal to 54mm. Moderate pain is defined as greater 54mm and less than or equal to 114mm. Severe pain is defined as greater than 114mm. At each step, when patients report moderate to severe pain, the IANB is considered to have failed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of dental anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>The initial measurement is obtained before treatment, and 5 and 30 minutes after administration of anesthesia. Data of each patient are recorded by the end of the visit, which takes an average of 4 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are instructed to rate their dental anxiety level on a VAS-Anxiety. The VAS consists of four categories of scales on a 10cm VAS line. No anxiety corresponds to 0cm. Mild anxiety is defined as greater than 0cm and less than 5.1cm. Moderate anxiety is defined as greater than or equal to 5.1cm and less than 7.0cm. Severe anxiety is defined as greater than or equal to 7.0cm.</description>
