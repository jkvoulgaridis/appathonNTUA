      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about how LY3526318 affects blood flow to the
      skin in healthy women. For each participant, the study will last up to 28 days and Part B
      will last up to 78 days, including screening and follow-up.

               -  No drugs (except study drug, hormonal contraceptives) 7 days prior to each
                  assessment and until discharge from Clinical Research Unit (CRU)

               -  No chocolate, alcohol, or caffeine containing products 24 hours prior to
                  initiation of each assessment and until discharge

               -  A complete 4 hour fast (water is allowed) prior to cinnamaldehyde (CA) assessment

          -  Must have suitable skin characteristics for the dermal CA challenge procedures and
             measured through Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Must not be currently enrolled in or discontinued within the last 30 days or 5
             half-lives of the study drug (whichever is longer), from a clinical study involving an

             this study

          -  Must not have received treatment with biological agents (such as monoclonal
             antibodies, including marketed drugs) within 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to dosing

          -  Must not have a history or presence of medical illness including, but not limited to,
             any cardiovascular, hepatic, respiratory, hematological, endocrine, psychiatric or

             severe post-treatment hypersensitivity reactions

          -  Must avoid excessive tanning

          -  Must not use lotions, oils, depilatory preparations, makeup, or other topical
             treatments on the arms on a regular basis or have used any topical treatments within 7
             days prior to start of the first study day

          -  Must not be a habitual and heavy consumer of coffee or caffeinated beverages (more
             than approximately 4 cups of tea, coffee, or cola drinks/day) or who cannot refrain
             from caffeinated beverages 24 hours prior to CA application

          -  Must not be drinking alcohol 24 hours prior to each assessment

          -  Must not be around second-hand smoke 24 hours prior to CA application or use
