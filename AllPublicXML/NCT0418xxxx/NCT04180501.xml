    <description>From the beginning of treatment to the end of follow-up study, when the longest diameter of brain metastases treated by SRS was more than 30% smaller than the baseline level at any time of efficacy evaluation, the objective remission of the lesions was achieved. The time from the objective remission to the next progress of the intracranial lesions was recorded as the intracranial progression-free survival(iPFS).</description>
