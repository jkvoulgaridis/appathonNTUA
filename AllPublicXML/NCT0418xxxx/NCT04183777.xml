      We are going to provide each parent or guardian whose children fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria attending to Department of Paediatrics Dentistry at Cairo University to fulfil
      questionnaire which include multiple MCQ questions. The state of oral health and dental
      treatment needs will be assessed based on clinical examination, according to recommendations
      of the World Health Organization. The total number of teeth and number of teeth affected by
      decay (d, D) in every child will be recorded. The intensity of caries will be estimated based
      on the average dmf/DMF number, i.e. caries intensity index.

      The dental treatment needs of each child will be assessed based on the following categories:

        1. None: no restorative treatment required.

        2. Simple: preventive treatment required, such as scaling and brushing, oral hygiene
           instruction (OHI), application of topical fluoride and fissure sealant.

        3. Moderate: one or more of teeth require one or two surface restoration.

        4. Complex: one or more teeth require three or four surface restoration / stainless steel
           crown, endodontic therapy and crown, and /or extraction(7) .

      Reasons for first dental visit will be categories as :

      a. Adaptive visit dental check-up preventive purpose. b. Tooth pain. c. Emergency case (tooth
      injury, abscess, infection). d. Decay noted by parent.

      e. Any Other. We will explain to the parents and legal guardians the aim of the study without
      any guiding to prevent any information bias which may occur. The questionnaire will be given
      before the treatment and will be collected after it. Any children whose records will include
      missing information will be excluded from the study.
