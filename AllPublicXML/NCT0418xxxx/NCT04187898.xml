  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Eflapegrastim on duration of
      neutropenia in patients with early-stage breast cancer when administered at varying intervals
      following Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open label, actively-controlled study to evaluate the same day
      dosing of Eflapegrastim on duration of neutropenia when administered at varying intervals
      following Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy in patients with early-stage
      breast cancer .

      Approximately 45 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 dosing time
      schedule arms.

      Each cycle will be 21 days. Total 4 cycles will be evaluated for this study. On Day 1 of
      Cycle 1, patients will receive Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (TC)chemotherapy followed by
      administration of Eflapegrastim at 1 of 3 time schedules post-TC (30mins, 3 hours or 5
      hours). During Cycles 2-4, patients will receive Eflapegrastim 24 hours after TC
      administration (on Day 2).

      Safety evaluations will be conducted once the first 3 patients in each arm have completed
      Cycle 1 to determine if it is safe for patients to continue in that particular treatment arm.
