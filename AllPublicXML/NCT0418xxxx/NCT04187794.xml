  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A medication non-adherence is reported in chronic rheumatic diseases, in a context of complex
      and long-term treatments (injectable/per os targeted therapies, biosimilar...). Understanding
      and integrating the patient into a shared medical decision are key factors for adherence.
      From this perspective, the level of literacy (an individual's ability to find, understand and
      use health information) must be explored in order to adapt the communication of information.
      These are currently insufficiently adapted to the individual understanding of patients. In
      practice, literacy assessment is very poorly integrated into routine care, while several
      tools are validated in French. In rheumatology, foreign studies have shown that literacy is
      positively related to knowledge level. The results remain contradictory regarding its
      association with medication adherence. Today, the literacy level of patients with rheumatic
      diseases and its impact on adherence has not been studied in France, although these
      evaluations would be useful to adapt interventions individually. The acceptance of patients
      to complete a literacy assessment questionnaire during their care should also be analysed as
      a condition of its deployment.
