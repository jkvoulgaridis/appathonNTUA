  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the second leading cause of death among those aged 10-29 years, the 9th leading
      cause of death overall, and there are 4000 completed suicides per year in Canada. Painful
      childhood experiences, relationship stresses and psychological trauma are strongly linked
      with later developing suicidal thoughts and behaviors. They are also strongly linked to the
      development of a variety of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression and
      posttraumatic stress disorder. However, patients with suicidal ideas are often left out of
      trauma treatment, for fear that it will worsen their distress and increase their suicidal
      thinking. However, there is preliminary evidence that treating posttraumatic stress symptoms
      in patients with suicidal thoughts can lead to improvement in their symptoms and a reduction
      in suicidal thinking.

      For many individuals, overwhelming emotions and/or painful negative beliefs stemming from
      traumatic experiences contribute to a desire to escape though suicide or self-harm. Eye
      Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based therapy for
      posttraumatic stress disorder that desensitizes painful memories, so that reminders in the
      present no longer provoke the overwhelming emotional responses. It has also been used for
      depression and a variety of other mental health problems.

      This study aims to test the safety and effectiveness of EMDR for patients admitted with
      suicidal thinking or urges to harm the self. Adults (ages 18 to 65) admitted to Alberta
      Hospital Edmonton will be able to volunteer for this study. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either EMDR therapy or usual care. Symptoms of anxiety, depression,
      post-traumatic stress, distressing emotions, and suicidal thinking will be compared before
      and after therapy. For the EMDR group, side effects to EMDR will be tracked. The number of
      emergency room visits, hospitalizations and healthcare costs in each group will also be
      compared before and after therapy for each group.

      Suicide is the second leading cause of death among those aged 10-29 years, the 9th leading
      cause of death overall, and there are 4000 completed suicides per year in Canada. Adverse
      childhood experiences, interpersonal stressors and trauma correlate strongly with suicidal
      behaviour and the later development of psychopathology such as depression. For many
      individuals, overwhelming emotions and/or painful negative beliefs stemming from traumatic
      experiences contribute to a desire to escape though suicide or self-harm. Eye Movement
      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based therapy for posttraumatic stress
      disorder that desensitizes painful memories, so that reminders in the present no longer
      provoke the overwhelming emotional responses.

      This non-blinded randomized study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of EMDR for
      patients admitted with suicidal and/or self-injurious behaviors. Adults (ages 18 to 65)
      admitted to Alberta Hospital Edmonton with suicidal or self-injurious behaviours will be
      eligible to volunteer for this study. Patients will be randomized into two groups, both of
      which will have access to usual psychiatric care. The target recruitment is 40 participants
      per group. One group will be randomized to receive Eye Movement Desensitization and
      Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in addition to usual care, to treat the experiences associated
      with suicidal ideation. The second &quot;treatment as usual&quot; (TAU) group will serve as a control.
      This TAU control group will also have access to an open, twice weekly mindfulness group at
      the hospital which is routinely offered to all patients. Clinical measures of anxiety,
      depression, post-traumatic symptoms, emotional dysregulation, and suicidal thinking will be
      compared before and after therapy. The impact on emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations
      and healthcare costs will also be evaluated.

    <description>Patients will receive 1 to 3 preparation sessions (which will include psychoeducation and preparation exercises before EMDR), followed by up to 12 EMDR sessions. EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) is an evidence based trauma therapy which has also been used in many other disorders (anxiety, depression, etc). These EMDR sessions will focus on the experiences, urges or negative thoughts associated with their suicidal thoughts and/or self-harm urges. The sessions will be 90 minutes in length and occur twice to three times per week while they are hospitalized, and then once to twice weekly thereafter if discharged. This group will also have access to usual care, which usually includes a family doctor or psychiatrist, mental health therapist and having access to Edmonton's community mental health programs.</description>
