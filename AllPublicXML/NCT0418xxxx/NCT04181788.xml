  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 protocol to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, and
      pharmacodynamics of PF-06801591, a programmed death-1(PD-1) antagonist monoclonal antibody
      (mAb) in participants with advanced malignancies.

      This study consists of 2 parts:

      Phase 1b part (dose escalation and dose expansion) in patients with advanced malignancies in
      Asia and a global Phase 2 part in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
