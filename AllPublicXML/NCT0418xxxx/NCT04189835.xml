  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients are treated with immunosuppressive drugs to avoid rejection of the
      transplanted organ. As the medication impairs the immune response, it also increases the risk
      of serious infections and cancer in transplant recipients compared with the general
      population.

      Previous studies have shown a close association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and post
      transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), with frequent demonstration of the virus in
      lesional tissues. Transplant recipients without evidence of EBV infection prior to
      transplantation (EBV seronegative) are at particularly high risk of developing PTLD. Other
      risk factors include a high viral load. As part of a preventive approach against PTLD,
      several transplantation units now monitor the occurrence of EBV DNAemia after
      transplantation. However, there is little evidence to guide this strategy; nor is there
      consensus concerning either the best specimen to use for EBV analysis (whole blood or plasma)
      or the appropriate clinical action to take if EBV DNAemia is detected.

      Our aim is to estimate the incidence and clinical consequences of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      DNAemia in whole blood and plasma in renal transplant recipients, and to determine if
      persistence of EBV DNAemia can predict excessive immunosuppression as indicated by the
      incidence of infections requiring hospitalisation, EBV driven PTLD and mortality.
