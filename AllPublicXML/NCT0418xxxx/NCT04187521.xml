    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study is that women with different physiologic subtypes of
      gestational diabetes (GDM) (insulin secretion deficit vs. insulin sensitivity deficit) will
      differ in their glycemic responses to meals with different portions of dietary
      macronutrients. Investigators will determine GDM subtype based on glucose and insulin levels
      taken at multiple time points during an oral glucose tolerance test. Participants will
      consume two meals with different macronutrient content while wearing a continuous glucose
      monitor which will allow investigators to assess the glycemic response to the meals.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus can be classified based on impairments in two different physiologic
      parameters, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. The investigator involved in this
      trial has previously defined GDM subtypes based on underlying physiology and demonstrated
      that women with GDM and predominant sensitivity defects have an elevated risk of adverse
      pregnancy outcomes, while women with predominant secretion defects do not appear to carry the
      same risk. This supports the idea that not all gestational diabetes is the same. Ideal
      treatment strategies may differ between GDM subtypes. In this trial, investigators will
      evaluate the postprandial glycemic response to two test meals with different macronutrient
      content in different GDM physiologic subtypes. Two test meals with different macronutrient
      proportions have been designed by research dieticians. Participants will eat test meals at
      home for breakfast in a randomized order after an overnight fast. Participants will complete
      food and blood sugar diaries, and will wear a continuous glucose monitor, which will measure
      postprandial glucose.
