    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICI) are becoming new standards of care for Non-Small Cell
      Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) treatment, both as first and second line of treatment. To date, no
      powerful predictive biomarker of response has been found. It has been recently shown that
      microbiota composition could dictate the ability of patients to respond to ICI. Since, the
      microbiota produces circulating metabolites that will subsequently act on immune system, the
      investigators hypothesized that metabolic signature, reflecting microbiota function, could
      represent a predictive biomarker of response to ICI.

      Primary objective is to identify baseline metabolic signature (metabolomics analysis by Mass
      spectrometry) associated to ICI response. Secondary objectives are to link metabolic
      signature with microbiota composition (metagenomics analysis RNA 16S) and immune profile, and
      altogether with clinic response to ICI. Profile evolution (metabolic, metagenomics and
      immune) will be also analyzed at 2-month post ICI initiation and at tumor progression, if
      any.

      In order to do so, the investigators thus plan to enroll 60 NSCLC patients treated by ICI as
      1st, 2nd or 3rd line of treatment in CHUGA in 18 months. Blood as well feces will be
      collected prior to, and at 2 month following ICI treatment initiation as well as at
      progression. Will be excluded from this study, patients that have received antibiotic or
      corticotherapy 2 or 4 weeks before ICI initiation, respectively.
