  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a retrospective observational cohort analysis of subjects aged 65 years and
      older, who underwent bilateral cataract surgery within a single (15 hospital) healthcare
      system, to determine the association between type (conventional or blue-light filtering) of
      implanted intraocular lens and survival.

    <description>The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Mortality was identified based on the Social Security Death Master File and discharge status. Follow-up started from the day after the initial surgery until the end of the study period or death, whichever occurred first. Time to death was calculated as the number of days from the first cataract surgery to death. Participants who did not have a recorded death were censored on April 30, 2019.</description>

        The study population consisted of all adult patients (at least 65 years) who underwent
        bilateral cataract surgery between January 01, 2012 and January 01, 2018 within the
        University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) healthcare system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population consisted of all adult patients (at least 65 years) who underwent
             bilateral cataract surgery between January 01, 2012 and January 01, 2018 within the
             University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) healthcare system. To be considered
             bilateral and concomitant, cataract surgery had to be performed on both the left and
             the right eye within a 365-day period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We excluded patients undergoing unilateral cataract surgery, surgery to replace or
             repair a previously implanted IOL, or bilateral implantation with one Blue-IOL and one
             Natural-IOL (i.e., mixed IOL transmission properties).
