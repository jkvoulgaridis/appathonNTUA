  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor disorders (PFD) can adversely affect the quality of life of a woman and they can
      occur during different stages of female life such as during pregnancy, early postpartum
      period or during menopause. It is well known that pregnancy and vaginal birth are significant
      risk factors in the etiology of PFD and predicting models like UR-CHOICE score were developed
      for this reason to provide mothers-to-be with sufficient information regarding their
      subsequent risk of PFD. Pregnancy, childbirth and the immediate postpartum period, where the
      demands on the pelvic floor and the incidence of pelvic floor trauma are particularly high,
      offers an optimal opportunity for such counseling and prevention.

      Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) can adversely affect the quality of life (QoL) of a woman and
      they can occur during different stages of female life such as during pregnancy, early
      postpartum period or during menopause. The reported prevalence of PFDs varies widely both
      during and after pregnancy and reported up to 30-50%. Besides, the term PFD includes a broad
      spectrum of conditions such as urinary incontinence (UI), pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or anal
      incontinence (AI). Many risk factors seem to be involved like the pregnancy itself, mode of
      delivery, parity, the use of episiotomy, obesity, increased age and so on. It is well known
      that pregnancy and vaginal birth are significant risk factors in the etiology of PFDs and
      predicting models like UR-CHOICE score were developed for this reason to provide
      mothers-to-be with sufficient information regarding their subsequent risk of PFD. The
      identification of women during their pregnancy who are at higher risk for PFD remains a key
      element in targeting of prevention and planning health of resource allocation strategies.
      Pregnancy, childbirth and the immediate postpartum period, where the demands on the pelvic
      floor and the incidence of pelvic floor trauma are particularly high, offers an optimal
      opportunity for such counseling and prevention. The validated German pelvic floor
      questionnaire modified for pregnancy and postpartum period is thus an important tool
      identifying such symptoms and helping clinicians assess patient's quality of life. The aim of
      the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of PFDs in a cohort of Egyptian women during
      pregnancy. Furthermore, we searched for clinical risk factors that correlate with the
      occurrence of PFDs during pregnancy in the investigator's population.

    <description>a self-administered questionnaire for the assessment of pelvic floor disorders, their risk factors and their impact of quality of life during pregnancy and postpartum period which integrates bladder, bowel and sexual function, pelvic organ prolapse, severity, bothersomeness and conditions specific quality of life in women with urinary incontinence (UI) and/or POP. The questionnaire is divided into four main domains (bladder, bowel, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual function) and each question is scored from zero to three. The additive scores are divided by the maximum reachable score and multiplied by ten, giving a value between zero (0 = no symptoms) and ten (10 = maximum symptoms) for each of the domains.</description>

        Women ran through the questionnaire either during their first or last visit at the
        outpatient clinic and afterwards they were classified into two groups: patients with one or
        more PFDs (n = 96/200) (= significant psychological strain in at least one pelvic floor
        domain) and patients without any pelvic floor complaints (n = 104/200). Clinical
