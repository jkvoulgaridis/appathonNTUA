      This preliminary, open-label study assesses the feasibility of 34mg at bedtime for 6 weeks in
      Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and insomnia.

    <textblock>
      More treatments are needed to target insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
      There is evidence to suggest that pimavanserin, a medication approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, may improve deep sleep
      and insomnia. This study preliminary assesses the feasibility of pimavanserin 34mg at bedtime
      for 6 weeks for the treatment of chronic insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets criteria for current Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as per a total score
             of ≥33 on the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for PTSD.

          -  Meets DSM-5 standards of chronic insomnia disorder, as follows: a. Complains of
             dissatisfaction with nighttime sleep in the form of difficulty falling asleep
             (subjective sleep onset latency ≥30 minutes), difficulty staying asleep (subjective
             time awake after sleep onset ≥30 minutes), and/or awakening earlier in the morning
             (≥30 minutes before scheduled wake time and before a total sleep time of 6.5 hours)
             than desired. b. Insomnia frequency of ≥3 times per week c. The duration of the
             insomnia complaint is ≥3 months d. Associated with complaint of daytime impairment.

          -  Insomnia Severity Index total score ≥15 (moderate insomnia).

          -  Willing to not start a concurrent behavioral or other treatment program for insomnia,
             PTSD, or other psychiatric disorders during the participation in the study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active agree to use two methods of
             contraception for the duration of the study and extending to 30 days after the last
             dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or a history of a primary psychotic disorder (i.e., schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective or bipolar disorder)

          -  Active suicidal or homicidal ideation requiring crisis intervention

          -  Current moderate or severe alcohol or marijuana use disorder, or other illicit use
             disorder of any severity

             (i.e., stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis);

          -  Caffeine use that is deemed excessive and is contributing to the insomnia per the
             opinion of the investigators (i.e. caffeinated beverages consumed after 18:00 3
             times/week or more and/or that correlates with the timing of the insomnia complaints).

          -  Tobacco use before bedtime that is contributing to the insomnia per the opinion of the
             investigators or that would interfere with completing an overnight polysomnogram.

          -  Previous diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome,
             circadian rhythm sleep disorder, narcolepsy, Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder, or
             other sleep disorders (except obstructive sleep apnea) that may confound, per the
             opinion of the investigators, the assessment of insomnia.

          -  Previous diagnosis of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (defined as an AHI
             equal to or greater than 15)

          -  Participants deemed to be at high risk of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea
             per the Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index, Age,

             therapy for 1-month and if inclusion and exclusion criteria are still met.

          -  Participants identified as having moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea during
             the screening polysomnogram. These participants will be referred to clinical treatment

          -  Periodic limb movement arousal index 15 or greater or other sleep disorders captured
             during the screening polysomnogram that may confound, per the opinion of the
             investigators, the assessment and treatment of insomnia

          -  A prolonged QT interval, corrected for heart rate (QTc), at the screening
             electrocardiogram. A prolonged QTc is defined as 470 milliseconds for males and 480
             milliseconds for females.

          -  Engagement in an evidence-based psychotherapy for 1-week prior to enrollment that in
             the opinion of the investigators, may confound the assessment of insomnia

             renal, neurological, hepatic, and/or chronic pain that in the opinion of the

             assessments

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at screening

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are not practicing acceptable pregnancy

          -  Current use of a prohibited medications: Hypnotic or sedating medications taken at
             bedtime for insomnia; antipsychotics and antidepressants with known 5HT2A antagonist
             activity; medications that increase or decrease the metabolism of pimavanserin;
             medications that increase the risk of QTc prolongation

          -  Patients with conditions known to increase the risk of torsades de pointes and/or
             sudden death, such as symptomatic bradycardia and other cardiac arrhythmias,
