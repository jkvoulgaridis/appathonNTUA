  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who suffer from binge eating disorder experience recurrent episodes of binge
      eating.During these episodes, they consume an unusually large amount of food in a short
      amount of time and experience loss of control over eating. However, why such binge eating
      episodes occur is still largely unknown. This makes it difficult to develop targeted
      treatments. In this project, the experimenters are investigating the brain mechanisms that
      give rise to the disorder. They hypothesize that the binge eating episodes are due to an
      increased variability in reward processing, which they will assess repeatedly over days. They
      will test this hypothesis using mathematical models based on behavioural and MRI measurements
      that are related to the processing of rewards.
