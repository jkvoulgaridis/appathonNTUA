  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroidectomy operations have traditionally been performed as open surgery. However, the
      scarring that occurs in the patient leads to cosmetic problems, especially in young women.
      Today, as a result of the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques, the number
      of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgeries (NOTES) is increasing. Surgical scars
      are avoided by using natural pathways such as the mouth, urethra, vagina or anus. Transoral
      endoscopic thyroidectomy (TOETVA) with vestibular approach, a form of NOTES, was first
      performed in 2011. In this method, the operation is performed through three ports entered
      near the gingiva-buccal sulcus. TOETVA surgeries are performed with an insufflation pressure
      of 6 mmHg in the neck region. No studies are examining the effects of this pressure on the
      blood vessels in the neck region on the blood supply to the brain tissue. Therefore, the
      investigators aim to compare cases operated using open thyroidectomy or TOETVA method by
      measuring cerebral regional tissue saturation.
