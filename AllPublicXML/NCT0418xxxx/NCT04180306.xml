      The PEWS implementation study will be undertaken with the following objectives:

        1. Assess the effectiveness of implementation of PEWS and resuscitation training to
           identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration and to impact the frequency of
           clinical interventions made by treating providers on these patients.

        2. Assess the effectiveness of implementation of PEWS and resuscitation training to impact
           time sensitive clinical interventions made on patients at risk for clinical
           deterioration.

        3. Assess the impact of implementation of PEWS and resuscitation training on length of stay
           for patients admitted to the pediatric oncology ward.
