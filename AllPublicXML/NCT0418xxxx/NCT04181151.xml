  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latissimus Dorsi (LD); Medial sacrum, lumbar vertebrae and lower thoracic vertebrae 10-12
      lateral to the spinous processus. It is a fan-like wide muscle that connects to the inferior
      angle of the scapula and ribs, adheres to the anterior surface of the proximal humerus and
      continues with aponeurosis of the contralateral Gluteus Maximus below. The activation of the
      LD muscle during the functional reach activity, which we use most frequently in daily living
      activities, affects the upper extremity and trunk movements. Therefore it is important muscle
      that affects the quality of movement.

      The study include individuals with stroke that middle cerebral artery (MCA) involvement
      diagnosed by the neurologist and include healthy subjects. During sitting activity, they will
      be required to reach three different distances in the sagittal and scapular plane: arm
      length, 125% of the arm length and end point where it can reach the modified functional reach
      test. During the activity, electromyography (EMG) activation of latissimus dorsi, anterior
      deltoid and erector spina muscles will be examined with electromyographic device.

      Hypothesis originating from the investigation:

      H1: Latissimus dorsi muscle segments show different activation during functional reach
      activity.

      H2: Activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments is affected by reaching direction during
      functional reach activity.

      H3: Activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments is affected by reaching distance during
      functional reach activity.

      H4: Activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments during functional reach activity is
      affected in patients with stroke.

      H5: The activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments in stroke patients is affected by
      reaching direction during functional reach activity.

      H6: The activation of latissimus dorsi muscle segments in stroke patients is affected by
      reaching distance during functional reach activity.

      Measurements will be made during the sitting activity of the individuals included in the
      study. Individuals will be asked to reach midsternal height cups in two separate planes,
      sagittal and scapular, at arm's end, 125% of arm's distance and end point where it can reach
      according to modified functional reach test.

      Muscle activation of latissimus dorsi, erector spina and anterior deltoid muscles will be
      measured by superficial electromyographic measurement. Muscle activation according to SENIAM
      for erector spina and anterior deltoid will be evaluated. For latissimus dorsi, activation
      will be measured in six segments separated according to anatomic dissection.

      Reach activity will be performed 3 times on each side and at 1 minute intervals.
