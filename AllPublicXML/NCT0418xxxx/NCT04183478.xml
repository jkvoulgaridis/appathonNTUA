  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No Standard therapy has been approved for third-line therapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.
      K001 is peptidoglycan prepared from the marine microorganism, with an anti-tumor activity.
      Previously, the phase I study of K001 has shown that K001 was safety and had some
      effectiveness for pancreatic patients. Now, we would like to lunch a randomized, blinded,
      parallel-controlled, multi-center phase II/III study to compare the best support care (BSC)
      plus K-001 versus BSC plus placebo for the third-line and later treatment of patients with
      advanced pancreatic cancer.
