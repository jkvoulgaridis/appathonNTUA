      The Personalized Treatment Study creates an individualized network of symptoms for a
      participant with a current eating disorder. This network will be used to develop a
      personalized treatment intervention. This study aims to 1) determine if personalized
      treatments can be conducted using a network analysis of patient symptoms, and 2) to assess
      the effectiveness of network-informed personalized treatment for participants with eating
      disorders.

      Cognitive behavioral theory proposes that cognitions, behaviors, affect, and physiological
      symptoms interact with each other to maintain and exacerbate psychiatric disorders (Beck,
      2011). Network theory identifies core symptoms that maintain and promote the spread of ED
      psychopathology within individuals (Borsboom &amp; Cramer, 2013). Once identified, core &quot;trigger&quot;
      symptoms can be directly targeted to disrupt the spread or &quot;activation&quot; of ED behaviors,
      which would help patients achieve full recovery, and ultimately, prevent relapse. One of the
      main goals of the Personalized Treatment Study is to create an individualized network for a
      participant with a current eating disorder, which can be used to develop a personalized
      treatment intervention. Our research questions are: 1) Can a personalized treatment plan be
      conducted from a network analysis of patient symptoms, and 2) How effective is this
      personalized treatment based off of a network of symptoms.
