  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the acute impact of diet quality modification
      during night work on 24-hr glucose variability (GV) and heart rate variability (HRV) in
      healthy free-living employees.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing body of data reports deterioration of cardio-metabolic health in shift workers.
      For example, large scale meta-analyses have reported shift workers to be at increased risk of
      developing type 2 diabetes and of experiencing a coronary event, compared to day working
      employees.

      Shift work causes complex changes in physiology (desynchrony of circadian rhythms) and
      behaviors including activity, sleep and eating patterns. The importance of meal timing is
      becoming increasingly recognized in both chronobiology and nutrition fields, with emerging
      awareness of 'chrono-nutrition', the interaction between nutrition and circadian time.

      Given the importance to the economy of a healthy aging workforce, and the increase in shift
      work prevalence, it is important to establish if diet modification can reduce the health
      disparities between shift and day working employees.

    <description>A 4-day diet (food and beverage provision for 3 meals and 2 snacks) will be provided along with an eating plan (time of each meal / snack). Typical 'shift diet' based on previous research investigating what UK night workers eat. The 'shift diet' will contain ~15% energy from added sugar, 15g fiber, 2.5 portions fruit/vegetable, no whole grains. Required energy intake (calories) for each day to maintain their current body weight. Energy (calorie) requirements for each participant will be calculated from age, sex and weight of the participant.</description>
