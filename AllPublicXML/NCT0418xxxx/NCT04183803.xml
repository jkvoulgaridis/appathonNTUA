  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate ideal graft tunnel positioning is essential for the successful application of
      anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The accurate insertion of the
      tibial tunnel (TT) and femoral tunnel (FT) remain a challenge.

      A robotic assisted new strategy for drill TT and FT in ACL reconstruction will be performed
      and its efficacy and accuracy will be assess.

      The investigators will prospectively include 30 patients with ACL rupture requiring surgical
      treatment. The reconstruction will be performed with hamstring tendon graft or patellar
      tendon graft. The femoral and tibial tunnels placement will be guided by the Rosa robot
      (Zimmer®).

    <description>Range of motion of the knee will be measured with IKCD score (International Knee Documentation Committee) IKCD score : The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function.</description>
