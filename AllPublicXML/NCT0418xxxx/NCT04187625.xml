  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial progenitor cells derived from and delivered to the renal vasculature may be
      stimulated to initiate differentiation programs during episodes of injury. We hypothesize
      that endothelial progenitor cells from the kidney can transition to a phenotype that promotes
      endothelial repair.

      This is an interventional study involving patients that have a diagnosis of chronic kidney
      disease. Patients will have at least stage 3 chronic kidney disease stage or greater.
      Kidney-derived endothelial progenitor cells will have been obtained using associated
      protocols that are currently approved by the Partners Human Research Committee.
