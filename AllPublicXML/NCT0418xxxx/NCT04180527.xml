  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about assessing the impact of reading previous patients' stories related to
      their hip or knee replacement surgery on patients' preoperative anxiety and sleep. This
      provision of previous patients' stories is part of an ongoing perioperative QI project in the
      regional anesthesiology division.

      This will be a pre-post experimental design study. The pre-intervention group of 80 hip or
      knee replacement surgery patients will receive the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and
      Information Scale (APAIS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in Preop Holding prior to
      having their block for their surgery. The block resident will give and collect the scale and
      inventory to patients. Patients are given these surveys as part of a quality improvement
      initiative, independently of this study. The survey data will be entered into the secure
      electronic research database. Following this, the post-intervention group of 80 patients will
      be given copies of previous patients' stories at their last visit to the surgeon's office
      prior to their surgery. These stories will be administered to all hip and knee surgery
      patients as part of the new standard of care due to a perioperative QI initiative,
      independently of this study taking place. These subjects will also receive the APAIS and PSQI
      for assessment in Preop Holding prior to their block for surgery, as part of the new standard
      of care. A third party broker will then de-identify the survey data and provide it to the
      research team for analysis. A two-sided independent t-test will be performed to evaluate the
      differences in anxiety and sleep scores between the pre- and post-intervention groups.

    <description>Compare preoperative Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) scores of patients undergoing hip or knee surgery who have read previous patients' stories to those who have not read the stories. The APAIS anxiety anxiety scale can have a range from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating a higher anxiety score. The cutoff score for identifying anxious patients in a clinical practice is typically 11.</description>
