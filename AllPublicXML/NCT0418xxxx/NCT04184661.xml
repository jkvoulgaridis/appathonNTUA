  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the cornerstone of phosphate / calcium / vitamin D
      metabolism: it is synthesized mainly by osteocytes and acts as a Phosphating agent, inhibitor
      of dihydroxyvitamin D, and inhibitor of synthesis and secretion of Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      in most tissues.

      The specific role of FGF23 on bone has yet to be demonstrated. In some diseases such as
      hypophosphatemic rickets (HR), the direct role of FGF23 on bone has not yet been studied to
      our knowledge, whereas these genetic hypophosphatemias are secondary to overexpression of
      FGF23, whether an activating mutation of FGF23 or inhibitory mutations of its inhibitors
      (Dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) and Phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase,
      X-linked (PHEX)). However, patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) have higher
      circulating FGF23 levels than healthy controls and these levels are higher in treated
      patients.

      Management of XLH consists primarily of correcting the native vitamin D defect by prescribing
      active vitamin D analogs as well as phosphate supplementation to improve bone mineralization
      and decrease dental complications, growth, and bone deformities. Recently, a new therapeutic
      option has been developed for XLH, burosumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds and
      inhibits FGF23 activity. The use of burosumab is currently authorized in France in some
      pediatric patients with severe forms of XLH.

      Independently of the indirect bone effects of phosphate correction and vitamin D levels, the
      direct role of burosumab on bone cells has never been studied. The objective of this project
      is to study the osteoclastic biology of patients with HR compared to control patients, and to
      evaluate the direct impact of the treatments used in this pathology on human osteoclasts.
