  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia of premature infants is a common respiratory disease in premature
      infants. Long-term complications such as recurrent respiratory infection and abnormal lung
      function may occur in the survivors, and may increase the risk of dysplasia of the nervous
      system. In the past 30 years, although the monitoring and treatment technology of premature
      infants has been significantly improved, the incidence of BPD still shows no downward trend,
      and effective treatment and prevention methods for BPD are still lacking. The progress of
      clinical research on BPD is slow, one of the important reasons is that the definition of BPD
      is still not consistent, and its diagnostic and grading standards lack objectivity. To
      summarize the development of diagnostic criteria for BPD in the past 30 years, there are
      still the following disadvantages. 1. 2. In the above study, all proposed alternative BPD
      classification standards did not completely separate HFNC and NIV. In view of this, this
      study separated HFNC and other NIV to form a new revised BPD classification standard. On this
      basis, a nested case-control study was conducted to compare the differences between the newly
      proposed classification standards and NICHD standards in 2001, Rosemary standards in 2018 and
      Jensen standards in predicting long-term respiratory outcomes and other systemic
      complications in premature infants, so as to provide a standard for more accurate diagnosis
      and evaluation of BPD in premature infants.
