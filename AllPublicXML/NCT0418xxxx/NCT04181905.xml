  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation characterized
      by time-varying respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness
      and cough, with limitation of expiratory airflow. These variations are often triggered by
      exercise, exposure to allergens or an irritation, weather changes or viral respiratory
      diseases (Karakış, 2018). Increased respiratory distress decreases the patient's activity,
      decreases the condition and makes the individual dependent in daily life. In the studies
      conducted in asthma patients, the cases stated that they perceived their illness as an
      obstacle against physical activity and thus they were pushed to immobility (Kırtay &amp; Oğuz,
      2011). In the literature, no study on the variable of kinesiophobia in asthma was found. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between kinesiophobia and physical
      activity level and quality of life in asthma patients.

      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by increased airway sensitivity to
      various stimuli and reversible airway obstruction (Soyuer et al., 2013). Bronchial
      hypersensitivity associated with chronic airway inflammation causes wheezing, dyspnea, chest
      tightness, and cough attacks, especially at midnight or morning. These attacks are associated
      with varying degrees of airway obstruction and usually improve with treatment or
      spontaneously (Arslan, 2011). Three mechanisms are responsible for the pathogenesis of
      asthma. These include reversible airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and increased
      airway sensitivity (Soyuer et al., 2013). Although it is known that genetic and environmental
      factors play a role in asthma formation, etiopathogenesis has not been fully explained
      (Arslan, 2011). Approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma and this
      prevalence increases by 50% every ten years. Hospitalization is frequently seen in patients
      with asthma (Autumn, 2015). It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people die annually
      due to asthma. No relationship was found between prevalence and mortality (Autumn, 2015).
      Asthmatic patients have intermittent symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and
      dry cough. Stimulants such as allergens, air pollution, gastroesophageal reflux, stress and
      exercise cause these symptoms. 90% of untreated asthmatics develop asthma symptoms during
      exercise (Dursun et al., 2013). Airway obstruction due to exercise occurs in 40-90% of
      asthmatics, decreases the ability to exercise and patients prefer a more sedentary lifestyle.
      Patients with asthma have low physical activity levels because they avoid exercising due to
      anxiety and depression, inactivity, fatigue, dyspnea (Autumn, 2015). The ability to perform
      activities and the ability to perform daily living activities are components of quality of
      life. In many studies, it has been found that quality of life is affected in individuals with
      chronic lung disease. Quality of life can be assessed with many disease-specific
      questionnaires. Asthma patients experience problems in many areas in terms of quality of
      life, including day and night disease symptoms, impaired daily living activities, and reduced
      quality of life. Asthma is associated with decreased quality of life and morbidity. Asthma
      symptoms reduce performance at school and at work; affects learning and reduces quality of
      life. It is stated that asthma has a negative effect on quality of life, physical,
      physiological and social function (Autumn, 2015).

      Airway obstruction due to exercise decreases physical activity in asthmatic patients. This
      may give rise to fear of movement over time. Avoidance of movement is called kinesiophobia.
      Kinesiophobia is a condition that occurs when patients want to perform their previous
      functions, especially in chronic painful disease processes.

      Kinesiophobia is an avoidance phenomenon within the cognitive behavioral avoidance model and
      patients may limit their activity in daily life in case of symptoms of deterioration or the
      occurrence of symptoms. This may result in emotional problems and life dissatisfaction in
      later periods (Yumin et al., 2017). Kinesiophobia has been the subject of study in
      cardiopulmonary cases, but there is no research on kinesiophobia in asthma. In this study,
      the effect of kinesiophobia on physical activity level and quality of life in asthma will be
      investigated.

    <measure>Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) that was developed in 1990 is a 17 item scale originally developed to measure the fear of movement related to chronic lower back pain. The TSK consists of 17 questions.A score of 17 is the lowest possible score, and indicates no kinesiophobia or negligible. A score of 68 is the highest possible score and indicates extreme fear of pain with movement.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short-form (IPAQ-SF) is one of the most widely used self-report questionnaires to assess PA. IPAQ-SF is a self-report questionnaire that assesses PA in the last 7 days [9-10]. Using the IPAQ-SF scoring system, the total number of days and minutes of PA were calculated for each participant as recommended in the IPAQ website [32]. The IPAQ-SF records the activity in four intensity levels: sitting, walking, moderate intensity (e.g., leisure cycling), and vigorous intensity (e.g, running or aerobics). MET method was used to determine the level of physical activity. Standard values for these activities were established. The generated values are expressed as follows; Severe Physical Activity = 8.0 MET, Moderate Severe Physical Activity = 4.0 MET, Walking = 3.3 MET, Sitting = 1.5 MET. Using these values, daily and weekly physical activity levels are calculated.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, social and occupational) that are most troublesome to adults (17-70 years) with asthma. Participants were asked to score the importance of each of the positively identified problems (0= not important - 4 = very important). The highest scoring problems were the same for both men and women, for patients with a wide range of asthma severity (no medication to oral steroids) and in different age groups.</description>
