    <textblock>
      The study was planned as 150 patients. Patients who met early-onset dysmenorrhea criteria and
      who met the inclusion criteria; 150 patients were divided into 2 equal groups, and NSAID
      during the menstrual cycle, nsai + turmeric 1 gr oral powder form treatment was planned to be
      started in the other group. The pain frequency and severity before and after treatment were
      evaluated by visual analog scale and the two groups were compared.

      There are scientific publications on the use of turmeric, which constitutes the hypothesis of
      our study, in branches such as cardiology, neurology, infertility and chest diseases due to
      its anti-inflammatory, anti-aging properties.

      The data are planned to be evaluated by the researchers using the SPSS(Statistical Package
      for the Social Sciences ) 17.0 program on computer. The responses of all groups to the VAS
      scores are planned to be entered into the system by using the SPSS program before and after
      treatment. statistics (number, percentage, mean, standard deviation), chi-square and logistic
      regression analysis are used to compare categorical variables. Chi-square test and Mann
      Whitney-U test are planned to be used in comparison between groups.When examining the
      difference between the groups, if the p value is less than 0.05, it is planned as a proof of
      significant difference.

    <description>To determine the effect of turmeric use on pain severity in early onset primary .The minimum pain score for dysmenorrhea is defined as 1 maximal pain score of 10 and a significant difference is planned if there is a significant difference between pretreatment scores and post-treatment scores if at least 50 percent reduction in turmeric use is achieved.It is predicted that there is no significant difference in visual analog scale scoring less than 50 percent and treatment is not effective.
Before and after the treatment of turmeric effect on visual analog scores will be compared and a significant difference will be observed if at least 50 percent improvement is detected.dysmenorrhea using visual analogue scoring.
The percentage of reduction in visual analog scores will be calculated in all patients using turmeric.</description>
