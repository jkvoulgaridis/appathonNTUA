  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensenbrenner syndrome, also known as cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED), is a rare
      autosomal-recessive disorder belonging to the ciliopathy group of diseases. It is
      characterized by a facial dysmorphism, abnormal bone development and ectodermal defects
      including dental anomalies. CED is a heterogeneous condition with significant phenotypic and
      molecular variability, whose spectrum may include cases of renal impairment, hepatic
      fibrosis, retinitis pigmentosa and/or brain anomalies. In many cases, patients develop
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to nephronophthisis between 2 and 6 years of age. The aim of
      this retrospective study is to better understand the characteristics of this syndrome and to
      find prognostic factors of CKD. We make the hypothesis that an early diagnosis of the
      syndrome would lead to a better global management of patients (quality of life, delayed onset
      of end-stage renal disease).

    <description>In many cases, patients with this syndrome develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to nephronophthisis between 2 and 6 years of age. Nephronophthisis is characterized by decreased urine concentration ability, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, cystic kidney disease and progression towards end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In this study, we would analyze the renal phenotypes through the level of Creatinine in the urine to detect early-stage kidney disease. All the data will be collected from the patient medical records.</description>
