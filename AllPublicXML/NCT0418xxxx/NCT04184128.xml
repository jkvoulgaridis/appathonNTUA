  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with cystocele may be associated with detrusor underactivity (DU) or bladder outlet
      obstruction (BOO). However, the impact of cystocele repair on the rates of DU and BOO
      remained obscure. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of DU and BOO
      in each age group and elucidate the impact of cystocele repair on the rates of DU and BOO.

    <textblock>
      Between November 2010 and September 2018, all women with ≥ POP-Q stage II cystocele who
      visited the urogynecological department of a medical center for urodynamic evaluation were
      reviewed. Those women who have no complete data of maximum flow rate (Qmax), voided volume,
      post-void residual volume (PVR) and detrusor pressure at a maximum flow rate (PdetQmax) were
      excluded from this study. The DU was defined when the PdetQmax was less than 20 cmH2O, the
      Qmax was less than 15 mL/s, and the bladder voiding efficiency (BVE) was less than 90 %. The
      BOO was defined when the PdetQmax was not less than 40 cmH2O, and the Qmax was less than 12
      mL/s. BVE = voided volume / (voided volume+ PVR) x 100%. Those women without DU or BOO were
      allocated to the non-DU/BOO group.

      STATA software was used for statistical analysis. Wilcoxon signed-rank test or McNemar's test
      was used for statistical analysis as appropriate. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant.

The BOO was defined when the PdetQmax was not less than 40 cmH2O, and the Qmax was less than 12 mL/s [1]. BVE = voided volume / (voided volume+ PVR) x 100%.</description>

    <description>The urodynamic assessment included uroflowmetry, filling cystometry with 35°C distilled water at a rate of 60 mL/sec, a pressure flow study, and a stress urethral pressure profile with patient in sitting position [14]. A 20-minute pad test for each woman was also performed [15, 16]. Multichannel urodynamic equipment (Life-Tech, Houston, TX, USA) with computer analysis and Urovision (Urolab Janus System V, Houston) was used. All terminology conformed to the standards recommended by the ICS [3]. All procedures were performed by an experienced technician, and the data were interpreted by a single observer to avoid interobserver variability.</description>
