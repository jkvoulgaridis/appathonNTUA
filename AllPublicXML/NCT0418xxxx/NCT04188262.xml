  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NVS Therapy is being studied to evaluate the safety and efficacy to facilitate retention
      of acute luminal gain, leading to acute hemodynamic improvement in superficial femoral and
      popliteal arteries with reference vessel diameters between 4.0 and 7.0 mm and lesion lengths
      less than or equal to 56mm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 1 study to assess the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy trends to applying NVS therapy to de
      novo lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the proximal popliteal artery (PPA)
      during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with life-style limiting
      claudication due to obstructive SFA and proximal popliteal artery atherosclerosis. Each
      investigator will receive supervised training for each procedure.

      Eligibility to participate in the study is determined during the screening period and prior
      to the index procedure with the NVS therapy. Study Data will be analyzed through the Day 365
      follow-up visit.

        General Description of Subject Population: Adults with symptoms of claudication and/or rest
        pain (Rutherford Classification 2, 3, or 4) (see Appendix 3) and angiographic evidence of
        an atherosclerotic lesion of the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal
        artery ≥70% diameter stenosis and &lt; 100% stenosis.

        Subjects must meet all of the following general eligibility criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) understands the study
             requirements and the treatment procedure and provides written informed consent before
             any study-specific tests or procedures are performed.

          3. Subject is eligible for PTA.

          4. Subject is willing to comply with all protocol required follow-up evaluations.

          5. Subject has documented Rutherford Classification 2 to 4 (see Appendix 3).

          6. Subject has laboratory test results that are within clinically acceptable limits.

          7. In investigator's opinion, subject is hemodynamically stable at the time of the index
             procedure.

          8. Subject has a life expectancy of ≥ 1 year in the opinion of the Investigator.

          9. Subject is able to tolerate the insertion of a 7F sheath into the common femoral
             artery (CFA), as determined by the investigator.

         10. Subject is able to undergo contralateral access, as determined by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must not meet any of the following general eligibility criteria:

          1. Subject had cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within
             the past 3 months prior to enrollment with any residual deficit involving the index
             lower extremity.

          2. Subject has any permanent neurologic defect that may impair ambulation and/or cause
             non-compliance with the protocol.

          3. Subject had a STEMI or NSTEMI within the last 3 months prior to enrollment.

          4. Subject is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant in the next 365
             days. Subjects (male and female) must agree to use effective birth control measures
             for duration of study.

          5. Subject is currently receiving oral or intravenous immunosuppressive therapy (e.g.,
             inhaled steroids are not excluded).
