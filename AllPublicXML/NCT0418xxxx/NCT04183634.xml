      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the adhesion of the test product when
      compared to the reference product following a single transdermal application.

      The following evaluations will be assessed as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;:

        -  Cold flow (dark ring formed around the patch)

        -  Patch movement/displacement

        -  Patch wrinkling

        -  Residue formation (at patch application on the release liner and at patch removal on the
           skin) Safety and tolerability of a single dose application of a patch containing 18 mg
           rotigotine (Test) against a patch containing 18 mg rotigotine (Reference) will be
           evaluated in terms of vital signs and AEs.

      AEs and clinical tolerability will be monitored at all clinical trial visits. The safety
      evaluation will be based upon the review of the individual values (potentially clinically
      important abnormalities) and descriptive statistics (summary tables, graphics).

      As additional safety parameters for the clinical trial physical examination findings,
      clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead ECGs will be assessed at the screening and
      follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease assessed as eligible for
             receiving 18 mg/IRR 8 mg/24 h rotigotine via the test and the reference product each
             on subsequent days in order to reach the dose of active substance at the individual
             routine medical care. Patients should be on a stable rotigotine dose of at least 8
             mg/24 h for at least 1 week before screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current participation in another clinical trial, participation in another clinical
             study (i.e. last protocol specified visit) involving another IMP within at least 28
             days prior to first application or previous participation in this clinical Trial

          -  History or presence of clinically significant dermatologic diseases or conditions,
             such as atopy, neurodermatitis, contact allergy, eczema, psoriasis, vitiligo,
             melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma.

          -  History or presence of any dermatological condition or skin sensitivity that could
             affect IMP Absorption

          -  History of clinically relevant (severe) hypersensitivity to the active pharmaceutical
             ingredient or substances of the same class or one of the excipients, clinically
             relevant allergy.
