  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate how the brain changes in patients undergoing
      electroconvulsive (ECT) treatment for depression. Subjects will be invited to be in this
      study because (1) he/she is a patient about to receive ECT treatment for depression, or (2)
      he/she is a healthy adult volunteer with no history of depression.

      All volunteers must be between ages 18-70. Participation in this research will involve three
      visits. Each visit will last about 4-5 hours. If subject is a patient receiving ECT for
      depression the study team will schedule study visits to go along with patient treatment
      visits. If subject is a healthy volunteer, visits will occur 1 month and 2 months after the
      initial visit.

      Participation in this research will involve playing simple computer games while subject's
      brain is scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, study team will assess
      symptoms of depression using questionnaires. Patients receiving ECT will not experience any
      changes to their standard of care ECT treatment plan. Healthy volunteers will not undergo ECT
      treatment.

      The goal for this study will be to test the following overall hypotheses: (1) that adaptive
      decision-making processes are disrupted in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and
      (2) the neural and behavioral changes associated with treatment-resistant depression can be
      assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging paired with computationally constrained
      adaptive decision-making games.

      The investigators will use computational modeling of incentivized decision-making tasks,
      brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI), and standard clinical
      assessments, to characterize patients referred to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for ECT.
      Characterization will occur over multiple visits to be aligned with the normal course of
      patient care.

      Data collected may be used in hypothesis driven analyses to:

        1. classify treatment resistant depression versus healthy controls

        2. predictors of ECT treatment success versus failure

        3. characterize brain and behavioral changes consistent with treatment success versus
           failure

        4. predict who will need maintenance ECT therapy

        5. determine what changes in decision-making behavior are apparent in patients who require
           ECT maintenance therapy versus those who do not.
