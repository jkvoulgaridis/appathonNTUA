      The objective of this study is to further the understanding and application of 60Hz
      subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson's patients with gait disorder. The
      investigators will achieve this through 2 study aims:

        1. Determine the impact of 60Hz subthalamic deep brain stimulation on gait kinematics using
           wearable sensors

        2. Develop machine learning models to predict optimal subthalamic deep brain stimulation
           frequency based on wearable sensors

      Gait disorder, which manifests as shuffling, reduction in speed, multistep turning, and/or
      freezing of gait (FOG), can arise later in the Parkinson's disease (PD) course and cause
      significant disability. Ultimately, patients are at risk for falls and can become socially
      isolated due to their mobility limitations. These symptoms tend not to respond to high
      frequency STN-DBS. However, lower frequency stimulation (60-80Hz) of the STN in treating gait
      disorder and/or freezing of gait has demonstrated benefit. This study potentially can expand
      knowledge of 60hz DBS while improving its utilization in combination with PD
      medicationsâ€”enabling sustainable and possibly predictable therapeutic benefit.
