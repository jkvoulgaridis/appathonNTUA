  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying pain memory in humans.
      Thus, this project aims to investigate the link between pain memorisation and memorisation of
      the associated context by addressing the issue of pain conditioning. The study is composed of
      two successive parts: one pilot then one experimental. The goal is to understand pain
      memorisation processes by analysing the parallel between pain memorisation and memorisation
      of a traumatic event. By using immersive virtual reality, investigators aim to show that
      contextual pain conditioning is associated with : 1- a specific neural networks; 2- a
      reactivation of vegetative and behavioural reactions related to pain as well as
      electro-physiological markers when re-exposure to the specific pain-conditioning-context; 3-
      an implicit hypermnesia of the pain-associated context and a struggle to extinguish
      conditioning; 4- a favoured elaboration of false memories of the contextual pain. The emitted
      hypothesis suggests that a cortical and behavioural mnemonic trace is created during encoding
      of pain in association with its context, and that the latter can reactivate although the pain
      itself has disappeared. This implicit cortical mnemonic trace, evoked by the simple
      pain-associated context, could explain the notion of pain print persisting at long-term in
      patients suffering from chronic pain.

    <description>Subjects are volunteers of 18 to 50 years of age that have given consent and that are affiliated to a social security. Overall, subjects must be in good health (no chronic pain, neuropathy or cardiac/respiratory issues etc.) and (for women) non-pregnant.
The subject will be seated in an armchair. He will be asked to explore the virtual environment using virtual reality glasses to validate it.
The subject will also have headphones and different shouts or noises will be broadcast and he will have to rate the level of dislike of each sound stimulation.</description>
