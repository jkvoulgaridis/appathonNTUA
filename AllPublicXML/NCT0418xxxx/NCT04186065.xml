      This study investigates how often cavities develop on the permanent teeth of patients with
      braces (orthodontic treatment). The hypothesis is that there is no difference in the number
      of cavities on the permanent teeth of patients with braces compared to similar patients
      without braces.

      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of early carious
      lesions (white spot lesions, or WSLs) for patients who are receiving orthodontic treatment
      compared to patients who are not receiving orthodontic treatment.

      Subjects will be recruited from the University of Kentucky Orthodontic Clinic patient pool.
      Orthodontic care at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry (UKCOD) is provided by
      orthodontic faculty, as well as students enrolled in the graduate orthodontic program at the
      UKCOD. Subjects will be invited to participate in this study after receiving an initial
      treatment plan with fixed appliances for at least one arch.

        Participants have to be 10 years older who are treatment planned for orthodontic treatment
        with fixed appliances in the Graduate or Faculty Orthodontic Clinic at University of
        Kentucky.

        Based upon the racial distribution of patients currently receiving treatment in the
        Graduate and Faculty Orthodontic Clinics, investigators expect that study population to be
        predominantly Caucasian, with minority representation from the African-American and
        Hispanic communities. The sample composition is expected to be equally weighted with
        respect to gender.
