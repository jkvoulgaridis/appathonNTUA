  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of second trimester
      medical abortion when provided by nurse midwives compared with physicians. The study sample
      will be obtained from Michu Clinic, affiliated with St Paul's hospital, in Addis Ababa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 10% of all abortions globally take place at or after 13 weeks gestation. Women seeking
      second-trimester abortion services are often the most vulnerable and socially disadvantaged
      population.Studies show the rate of second-trimester abortion procedures remains stable over
      time, even in high-access locations, confirming the ongoing need for accessibility to
      services in rural locations with limited access to care. In Ethiopia, second-trimester
      abortion services are widely available in Addis Ababa, making up a high proportion of the
      total number of abortions occurring each year in the country; however, access to accurate and
      reliable data is limited.

      The World Health Organization recommends that abortion can be provided at the lowest level of
      the healthcare system (WHO abortion guidelines). Training mid-level providers, such as
      midwives, nurses and other non-physician providers, to conduct second trimester aspiration
      abortions is proposed as a way to increase women's access to safe abortion procedures and has
      been highlighted by the WHO as an area in which rigorous research is needed (WHO task-sharing
      guidelines).

      The investigators seek to conduct a comparative study of patients undergoing second trimester
      medical abortion provided by either physicians or nurse midwives.
