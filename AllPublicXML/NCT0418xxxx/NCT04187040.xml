  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand hygiene is one of the most important measures to prevent healthcare associated
      infections. A hand hygiene technique consisting of three steps may be superior to the 6-step
      technique outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in terms of compliance with both
      indications and technique. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare compliance with
      hand hygiene indications and technique between a 3-step and the 6-step technique for applying
      hand rub in an international multicenter cluster randomized trial.

    <textblock>
      Hand hygiene is one of the most important measures to prevent transmission of pathogens
      between healthcare workers and patients, and ultimately, healthcare-associated infections.
      However, compliance with both hand hygiene indications and technique (outlining the steps for
      applying hand rub to ensure coverage of all surfaces of the hands) remains insufficient at
      most institutions worldwide. It was previously demonstrated that a hand hygiene technique
      consisting of three steps is superior to the 6-step technique outlined by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) in terms of compliance with both indications and technique in a single
      center study. Furthermore, the 3-step technique was non-inferior regarding microbiological
      efficacy in two experimental studies and during daily clinical practice. To further
      investigate the external validity and generalizability of these findings to different
      settings, this study compares both compliance with hand hygiene indications and technique
      between the 3-step and the 6-step technique for applying hand rub in an international
      multicenter cluster randomized trial.

    <intervention_model_description>All participating wards will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 allocation to either the intervention (3-step hand hygiene technique) or the control group (6-step hand hygiene technique). Randomization will be stratified by participating institution for balanced allocation. Within each stratum, block randomization will be applied to assign wards to the two study groups. Blocking will be used to ensure close balance of the number of wards assigned to each group at any time during the study. Stratified randomization will be performed to ensure balance of the two groups within each institution.</intervention_model_description>
