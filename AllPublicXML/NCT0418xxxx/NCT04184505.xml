    <textblock>
      Open-label, randomized, prospective multicenter phase III study to compare the role of HMT
      followed by HSCT vs HSCT upfront in HR-MDS with &lt;10% of BM blasts and of CHT vs HMT followed
      by HSCT in HR-MDS with &gt;10% BM blasts in terms of feasibility of HSCT (non-inferiority
      trial).
