  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of SCM-CGH in participants with steroid
      dependent/refractory chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) by measuring overall cGVHD
      response (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR] defined by National Institutes of
      Health [NIH] consensus development project criteria [2014]).

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response is defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Project Criteria (2014) and must occur, in the absence of new therapy for chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) and absence of progression of underlying disease or death. CR: Resolution of all manifestations in each organ or site. PR: Improvement in at least 1 organ or site without progression in any other organ or site. cGVHD Progression: Clinically meaningful worsening in 1 or more organs regardless of improvement in other organs.</description>
