  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single site pilot study. 30 subjects with EPP, defined as medical record
      documentation of the onset of clinically significant psychotic symptoms within the past ten
      years, will be enrolled. Prior to randomization (Session 1), subjects will undergo fMRI
      during EM and RS paradigms. This baseline scan will also include a high-resolution structural
      sequence for neuronavigation purposes. Then on three separate days each occurring one-week
      apart, subjects will receive one session of inhibitory (1 Hz) rTMS, one session of excitatory
      (20 Hz) rTMS, and one sham stimulation session targeting the precuneus. The order of the
      three interventions will be randomized. Immediately following each rTMS or sham session,
      subjects will undergo repeat fMRI during EM and RS paradigms. The investigators will also
      examine the effect of rTMS on EM performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of existing work studying rTMS as a treatment modality in schizophrenia, there are
      no studies that have examined the effects of precuneus directed rTMS on either EM deficits or
      the neurocircuitry subserving EM in schizophrenia. It is also important to note that the vast
      majority of studies using rTMS in schizophrenia have examined chronic populations where
      confounds associated with prolonged duration of illness may be present. EPP is a desirable
      population to study because these individuals tend to have fewer psychiatric and physical
      comorbidities and less antipsychotic drug exposure, all of which are factors that may
      confound investigations of new treatment interventions for this illness. In light of the
      significant unmet medical need associated with schizophrenia and the grave clinical effect of
      disrupted EM in the illness, rTMS modulating the precuneus, and potentially EM circuitry,
      represents an unexplored and potentially novel potential treatment option.

      This study proposes to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with inhibitory
      LF (1 Hz) and excitatory HF (20 Hz) rTMS protocols to interrogate the effects of rTMS
      targeting the precuneus on: 1) precuneus activation during EM task performance; 2) functional
      connectivity between the precuneus and key EM circuitry, specifically the DLPFC, ACC, and
      hippocampus and 3) performance during an in-scanner scene encoding and recognition EM task.
      This study will provide vital preliminary data on target engagement informing future clinical
      trials seeking to utilize rTMS to treat EM impairment in schizophrenia. This is an important
      population for study because if effective, rTMS may represent a novel treatment for EM
      deficits in schizophrenia. This study will also seek to refine the understanding of the brain
      circuitry that mediates the potential pro-EM effects of rTMS through the use of fMRI at
      baseline and following the course of rTMS administration.

    <description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that received FDA clearance for use in treatment resistant major depressive disorder in 2008. rTMS utilizes the application of a repetitively pulsed magnetic field over the scalp to induce an electric field within a discrete area of the cerebral cortex. This electric field results in altered ion flow across the neuronal cellular membrane and ultimately changes in neuronal polarization. rTMS modulates cortical activation depending on the stimulation parameters used. Physiological studies have provided evidence that low-frequency (LF) rTMS produces an inhibitory effect on local cortical excitability.Studies have also demonstrated that rTMS may increase or decrease functional connectivity between separate but related cortical structures, utilizing high and low frequency stimulation, respectively.</description>
