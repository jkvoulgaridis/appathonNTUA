      This study is an international, multicenter, open-label, single arm, prospective clinical
      trial and will evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab administered on a scheduled
      basis to prevent bleeds in patients with acquired hemophilia A (AHA).

    <description>All eligible patients with AHA will receive the same study medication consisting of once weekly subcutaneous emicizumab. For each subject, the maximal duration of the study will be 24 weeks including 12 weeks treatment with emicizumab and 12 weeks Immunosuppressive therapy according to local standard of care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with AHA based on a reduced FVIII activity (&lt;50 %) and positive

          -  Signed informed consent form before any study specific tests or procedures

          -  Male or female patients aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent

             treatment with aPCC during the course of the study

          -  Positive lupus anticoagulant at the time of screening

          -  Severe uncontrolled infection at the time of screening

          -  Signs of active disseminated intravascular coagulation at the time of screening

          -  Current treatment for thromboembolic disease or signs of current thromboembolic
             disease at time of screening

          -  Patients who are at high risk for TMA (e.g., have a previous medical or family history
             of TMA), in the investigator's judgment

          -  Known severe congenital or acquired thrombophilia

          -  Life expectancy &lt;3 months at the time of screening

          -  Other conditions that substantially increase risk of bleeding or thrombosis by the

          -  Concurrent disease, treatment, or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that could
             interfere with the conduct of the study, may pose additional risk, or would, in the
             opinion of the local investigator, preclude the patient's safe participation in and
             completion of the study

          -  Addiction or other diseases that preclude the patient from appropriately assessing the
             nature and scope as well as possible consequences of the clinical study by the
