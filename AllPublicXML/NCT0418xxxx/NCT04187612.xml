  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underdiagnosed condition in obese pregnant
      women with serious and life-threatening complications to the mother and baby. The
      investiators propose that a non-invasive method may be used to detect patients at risk of
      OSA, giving these women access to the necessary treatment to treat this condition. The method
      is a estimation of body water, which has been shown to be linked to OSA in the non-pregnant
      population. Body water is estimated by applying surface electrodes to a participant who is
      lying down by measuring bioimpedance through body tissues by applying a tiny current between
      the electrodes. The electrical stimulation is not felt by the participant and has no negative
      effects on mother or baby.

    <textblock>
      It is already established that the increasingly prevalent condition of obesity is linked to
      OSA in pregnancy. Obesity is increasingly prevalent This study will evaluate a novel method
      of screening for OSA in the obese pregnant population, thereby treating this condition
      reducing the ill effects to mother and fetus.

      This will be a prospective observational cohort study. Eligible participants will be
      approached for consent during their third-trimester antenatal all-day clinic visit. Body
      water will be measured by connecting electrodes to participants hands, feet and neck whilst
      lying supine for approximately 15 minutes.

      Data on patient demographics, BMI, medical conditions, water body composition and indicators
      of OSA (breathing pattern and oxygen levels during sleep) will be collected, as well as data
      from patients' sleep tests as ordered by their physician.
