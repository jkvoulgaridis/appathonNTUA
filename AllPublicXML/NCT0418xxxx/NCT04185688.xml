  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of limits of stability ability is one of the major components of balance dysfunction in
      MS. The functional reach test is quick and clinically available tool for assessing limits of
      stability but reliability and validity of this test has not yet been systematically examined
      in people with Multiple Sclerosis.The aim of the study is to investigate reliability and
      validity of the functional reach test in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At baseline, the functional reach test, limits of stability test by using Biodex Balance
      System, Berg Balance Scale, four step square test, and timed up and go test was applied to
      the patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The functional reach test was repeated after seven days
      from the first application to evaluate its reliability.

    <description>Functional Reach Test: It measures the maximum distance an individual is able to reach forward beyond arm's length in the standing position when maintaining a fixed base of support.
Biodex Balance System: Biodex Balance System is used to evaluate limits of stability. The limits of stability test consists of standing on the platform and leaning in eight directions to make a cursor displayed on the system's screen hit a target.
Berg Balance Scale: It has 14 items, each of which is scored from 0 (i.e, severely impaired balance) to 4 (i.e., no balance impairment).
Timed Up and Go test: It requires individual to stand up from an armed chair, walk 3m, turn around, walk back to the armed chair, and sit down again.
Four square step test: It requires an individual to step over obstacles in various directions including forward, backward, and sideways.</description>
