  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Right ventricular (RV) physiological remodeling in response to prolonged strength exercise
      remains poorly studied. This prospective, non-randomized, single-center study, proposes to
      follow 24 healthy sedentary volunteers who will benefit from a high-intensity pure resistance
      training program over a 6-month period. The volunteers, aged between 18 and 40 years old and
      male, will be recruited and evaluated at the University Hospital center of Caen Normandy.
      Cardiac remodeling in response to physical exercise will be analyzed by trans-thoracic
      echocardiography repeated during the follow-up. The physical impact of the training program
      will be assessed by a treadmill exercise test predicting maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)
      before and after completing the training, and an isokinetic muscular test repeated every 3
      months. Participants rest/activity cycles will be monitor before and after 3 months of
      training. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the existence of a physiologic RV remodeling
      in response to pure high-load resistance chronic exercise. The results will help to improve
      the understanding of the physiological RV response expected in strength athletes.
