  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) impacts the lives of 30 million people worldwide. Pulmonary vein
      isolation (PVI) by catheter ablation is effective for paroxysmal AF, but the success rate
      remains marginal at 60-80%. For persistent AF, defined as continuous AF that sustains longer
      than 7 days, the success rate is even lower. The low success rate of AF ablation reflects the
      fact that there is no effective target identified to modify the underlying substrate beyond
      PVI. Recently, investigators have made an exciting discovery that higher mean CT attenuation
      values of peri-atrial fat tissue, correlated with inflammatory fat, are associated with
      higher incidence of recurrence after AF ablation. In this protocol, investigators will
      investigate the clinical significance of peri-atrial inflammatory fat tissue in AF using
      ultra-high resolution CT.

      Investigators will prospectively enroll 200 adult participants referred to the Johns Hopkins
      Hospital for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Investigators will first enroll
      participants with paroxysmal AF (n=100) to complete sensitivity analysis of inflammatory fat
      and potential target identification before enrolling participants with persistent AF (n=100).
      All participants (n=200) will undergo pre-procedural CT using the ultra-high resolution CT
      scanner 3-4 days prior the ablation procedure to allow a sufficient amount of time for image
      processing. In all participants (n=200), blood specimens will be collected immediately prior
      to the ablation procedure. The participants with paroxysmal AF (n=100) will receive the
      standard of care, which is PVI, and the clinical outcome will be followed up to 12 months
      post-procedure. In this group, investigators will conduct a sensitivity analysis to define
      the range of peri-left atrial (LA) fat tissue (in HU) that is associated with AF recurrence.
      Investigators will also conduct computation of source-sink mismatch arising from wall
      thinning due to fat infiltration into the myocardium that favors functional block and local
      reentry. For participants with persistent AF (n=100), investigators will conduct an
      exploratory clinical trial where the participants will be randomly assigned to 1) PVI group
      (n=50), or 2) PVI + inflammatory fat-targeted ablation group (n=50). In the latter group,
      additional focal ablation will be performed beyond PVI to target the inflammatory fat tissue
      based on the result of the sensitivity analysis. Randomization will be performed with the use
      of an automated computer-generated randomization algorithm. The participants will be unaware
      of the group assignment, but the operators will not be blinded (single-blinded design). In
      all patients, no ablation strategies beyond PVI except cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation
      for typical atrial flutter (AFL) will be allowed, such as linear lesions (e.g. roof lines,
      mitral isthmus lines), and focal ablation to eliminate complex fractionated atrial
      electrograms (CFAE) and rotating drivers.

    <measure>Freedom from any documented episode of AF</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Freedom from any documented episode of AF lasting longer than 30 seconds after the performance of a single ablation procedure without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). No episode of AF occurring within the initial 3-month blanking period after ablation will be counted. An episode of AF will be considered part of the primary outcome analyses if it lasts longer than 30 seconds and is documented by any form of monitoring, regardless of symptoms. A repeat left atrial (LA) ablation procedure at any time will also be considered to constitute a recurrence for the purpose of the outcome analyses. Participants who complete fewer than 3 months of follow-up and thus do not complete the blanking period will be excluded from endpoint analysis. There will be no blanking period after a second procedure.</description>
