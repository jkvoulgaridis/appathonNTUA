  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osmotherapy with mannitol has been a common practice in patients with raised ICP. Monitoring
      its effect on ICP can be performed invasively and non-invasively. Due to a validated
      correlation between invasive ICP monitoring and ONSD measurement, it can be a tool to monitor
      acute and long term effects of osmotherapy non-invasively on ICP. This study examines the
      acute changes in sonographically measured ONSD brought about by the administration of
      mannitol. This can correlate with the changes in ICP in such patients and can be utilized as
      a tool for decision making/ point-of-care utility.

      This is a prospective cohort based observational study including 40 patients admitted in the
      adult ICU at our center diagnosed as either a case of TBI/ acute stroke/ intracranial
      hemorrhages with a mean screening ONSD of more than 5mm under mannitol osmotherapy. ONSD were
      measured by a high frequency linear array probe (&gt;10 Hz) at the time of screening. Mannitol
      was then administered at doses prescribed by the treating physician over 20-30 minutes via a
      dedicated intravenous line. ONSDs were measured again at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after
      completion of administration of mannitol. Demographic data, baseline ventilator parameters of
      patients on mechanical ventilation, GCS and mean arterial pressure at each time points were
      recorded. Comparison of variables at these time points were made.
