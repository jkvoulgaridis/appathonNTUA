    <measure>Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ) total score - Change from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes 45 items, 39 of them grouped into 8 subscales, whose ratings reflect the severity and frequency of symptoms. Items are rated as &quot;0&quot; (not true), &quot;1&quot; (somewhat or sometimes true), or &quot;2&quot; (very true). The 8 subscales include general mood, breathing problems, hand behavior, face movements, body rocking/expressionless face, night-time behaviors, fear/anxiety, and walking/standing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>To rate how much the subject's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state, a 7-point scale is used from 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile™ Infant-Toddler Checklist - Social Composite Score (CSBS-DP-IT Social)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized screening scale for assessing communication and pre-linguistic skills in young children 12-24 months and can be used with older children with developmental delay. The CSBS-DP includes a suite of three separate measures: The Infant-Toddler Checklist, a follow-up Caregiver Questionnaire and a Behavior Sample. In this study only the Infant-Toddler (CSBS-DP-IT) Checklist will be used. The CSBS-DP-IT Checklist is a 24-item rating scale and each item is scored using a three-level rating of frequency: &quot;not yet&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; and &quot;often&quot;. Three composite scores assessing 7 skill areas can be calculated: 1) Social Composite (including Emotion and Eye Gaze, Communication Rate and Function, and Gestures); 2) Speech Composite (including Sounds and Words); 3) Symbolic Composite (including Understanding and Object Use).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Rett Syndrome Clinician Rating of Hand Function (RTT-HF)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical assessment of the subject's ability to use their hands for functional purposes (such as reaching for and grasping objects, self-feeding, or drawing). The assessment is made on an 8-point Likert scale (0-7) with 0 denoting normal functioning and 7 the most severe impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Rett Syndrome Clinician Rating of Ambulation and Gross Motor Skills (RTT-AMB)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical assessment of the subject's ability to communicate their choices or preferences, which can include the use of nonverbal means such as eye contact or gestures. The assessment is made on an 8-point Likert scale (0-7) with 0 denoting normal functioning and 7 the most severe impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>A 7 point scale that rates the severity of the subject's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. A subject is assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Rett Syndrome Caregiver Burden Inventory (RTT-CBI) Total Score (items 1-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is intended to directly address caregiver burden and indirectly assess the significance of treatment effects on function in the context of activities of daily living. Ratings are on a 5-point Likert scale including: 0-never; 1-rarely; 2-sometimes; 3-frequently and 4-nearly always. As in the original Caregiver Burden Inventory, the RTT-CBI has 24 negatively worded items (items 1 through 24) yielding a total score up to 96.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability Scale (ICND) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Treatment Duration</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates the effect of four conditions or health problems on 11 aspects of a child's or family's life as &quot;A lot&quot;, &quot;Some&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Not at all&quot;, or &quot;Does not apply&quot;. The four conditions or health problems are 1) inattentiveness, impulsivity, or mood, 2) ability to think and remember, 3) neurologic or physical limitations, and 4) epilepsy. The overall quality of life of the subject is also rated by responding to the following: &quot;Please rate your child's overall 'Quality of Life' on the scale below. Choose the number which you feel is best and circle it.&quot; The choices range from 1 (&quot;Poor&quot;) to 6 (&quot;Excellent&quot;).</description>
