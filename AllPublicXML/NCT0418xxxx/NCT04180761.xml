    <textblock>
      An operation and the constant further development of the surgical techniques can not always
      prevent the recurrence of a tumor of the stomach or the transition from the esophagus to the
      stomach. As reason for this recurrence, the investigators assume that the tumor was already
      present at the time of the surgery and has crossed the boundaries of the stomach or free
      tumor cells are located in the peritoneal cavity, even if they can't be found with the bare
      eye or imaging methods. Such free tumor cells have the possibility of developing metastases
      within the abdominal cavity.

      An innovative local treatment method is being tested in Tübingen and applied to remove any
      remaining free tumor cells or very small and invisible residual tumors. These free tumor
      cells can be determined prior to the start of treatment by peritoneal endoscopy (diagnostic
      laparoscopy). If these can be identified by lavage of the abdominal cavity there is an
      increased risk for the development of peritoneal metastases. Therefore, in patients with
      detected free tumor cells in the lavage water of the abdominal cavity, after the removal of
      the stomach, should be used once a chemotherapy in the abdominal cavity, which is warmer than
      the body (intraoperative hyperthermic chemotherapy, HIPEC). In this study the investigators
      want to demonstrate, that the single administration of intraoperative HIPEC with cisplatin
      and doxorubicin in addition to routine surgery delays the onset of peritoneal metastases and
      the additional therapy with its low risks is reasonable.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to estimate the effect of a combined therapy with gastrectomy and HIPEC in localized advanced gastric cancer. The primary target is the incidence of peritoneal metastases in CT and the proportion of patients who after one year are free from peritoneal metastasis. The study is intended to provide planning data for a subsequent Phase III study in the form of an RCT.</description>
