  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Directly reinforcing abstinence from alcohol with monetary incentives is an effective
      treatment for alcohol dependence, but barriers in obtaining frequent, verified biochemical
      measures of abstinence limit the dissemination of this treatment approach. The goal of this
      feasibility study is to use a breathalyzer and cost-controlling deposit contracts to
      facilitate a contingency-management intervention to reduce alcohol use that requires no
      in-person contact between the participants and the study staff during the intervention phase.
