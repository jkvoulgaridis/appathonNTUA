  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to train individuals with opioid use disorder to control their brain
      activity in a way that has been associated with their symptoms. Participants in the
      experimental group will be given direct feedback regarding their brain activity while they
      are undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, and will try to learn
      to control their brain activity during these feedback sessions. A separate group of
      participants will be given a control form of feedback that we do not believe can have
      clinical benefits. Our primary hypothesis is that the neurofeedback training will reduce
      opioid use and clinical features of opioid use disorder more than the control feedback.

    <measure>Opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one month post follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid use will be monitored by weekly urine test and the timeline followback method (TLFB). TLFB asks subjects to estimate drug use during a specific time period in the past.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2. Functional connectivity patterns in the brain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through follow-up (4 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to one month post follow-up (up to 2 months).</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured with the Opioid Craving Scale, a 3-item measure of craving that uses a 0-10 analog scale. Total possible score is 30, with higher score indicating more craving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one month post follow-up (up to 2 months).</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. This is a 16-item measure, using a 0-3 scale for each item. Total possible score is 48, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
