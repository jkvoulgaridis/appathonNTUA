  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oraxol is a combination of an oral tablet, HM30181 methanesulfonate, and capsules that
      contain paclitaxel. HM30181 is a drug that helps the body absorb paclitaxel, a drug used to
      treat cancer. Initially this study is intended as an extension study of KX-ORAX-002
      pharmacokinetic study for patients who wish to continue Oraxol treatment and who are eligible
      to participate. The purpose of this study is to check the safety and tolerability of Oraxol
      when it is administered on a weekly basis and to confirm the sustained oral bioavailability
      of paclitaxel following multiple dosing; also compare the relative bioavailability of
      paclitaxel tablets vs paclitaxel capsules (Group B only).

      Oraxol is a combination of an oral tablet, HM30181 methanesulfonate, and capsules that
      contain paclitaxel. HM30181 is a drug that helps the body absorb paclitaxel, a drug used to
      treat cancer. Initially this study is intended as an extension study of KX-ORAX-002
      pharmacokinetic study for patients who wish to continue Oraxol treatment and who are eligible
      to participate. Once the dose of Oraxol has been confirmed in the KX-ORAX-002 study, then
      enrollment of patients who have not participated in the KX-ORAX-002 study can be allowed. The
      purpose of this study is to check the safety and tolerability of Oraxol when it is
      administered on a weekly basis and to confirm the sustained oral bioavailability of
      paclitaxel following multiple dosing; also compare the relative bioavailability of paclitaxel
      tablets vs paclitaxel capsules (Group B only). Participants in Group B (N=8) will receive the
      same weekly paclitaxel capsule treatment as the remainder of the subjects except for 1 dosing
      week (at least 1 week following the paclitaxel capsule PK sampling period) during which they
      will receive paclitaxel tablets and undergo PK assessments.

    <intervention_model_description>For 1 dosing week (at least 1 week following the paclitaxel capsule PK sampling period, ie, at Week 5 or later), a subgroup of 8 participants (Group B) will receive Oraxol as HM30181 plus a tablet formulation of paclitaxel. For the remainder of the study, Group B participants will receive the current clinical capsule formulation of paclitaxel. This will allow for comparison of the bioavailability of these 2 formulations with minimal impact on safety or activity.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>From screening until final visit (within 28 days after the last dose of study drug was taken, and preferably before the participant receives any additional chemotherapy).</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability as assessed by the incidence of adverse events. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as those AEs with an onset after dosing and those pre-existing AEs that worsen during the study.
AEs will include those reported by participants as well as those observed by the clinical team, or clinically significant changes in lab tests, vital signs and ECGs. Possible AEs may include gastrointestinal effects and abdominal pain but as this is an early phase clinical trial and the likely AE profile is not yet known.</description>

    <time_frame>PK samples will be collected during dosing for Week 4 or may be done during a later dosing week at the investigator's discretion and/or at the participant's convenience before patients' withdrawal from the study, up to 8 months.</time_frame>

                  John's Wort) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (within 2 weeks prior to the start of
                  dosing in the study)

               -  Strong P-gp inhibitors (eg, verapamil) or strong inducers (eg, rifampin).
                  Participants who are taking such medications but who are otherwise eligible may
                  be enrolled if they discontinue the medication ≥1 week before dosing and remain
                  off that medication through the end of study treatment.

               -  An oral medication with a narrow therapeutic index known to be a P-gp substrate
                  (eg, digoxin, dabigatran) within 24 hours prior to start of dosing in the study

          2. Use of warfarin. Participants receiving warfarin who are otherwise eligible and who
             may be appropriately managed with low molecular weight heparin, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may be enrolled in the study provided they are switched to low molecular
             weight heparin at least 7 days prior to receiving study treatment.

          3. Unresolved toxicity from prior chemotherapy (participants must have recovered all
             significant toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE toxicity from previous anticancer treatments
             or previous investigational agents). This does not extend to symptoms or findings that
             are attributable to the underlying disease

          4. Received investigational agents within 14 days or 5 half-lives prior to the first
             study dosing day, whichever is longer

          5. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant myocardial
             infarction within the last 6 months, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant
             cardiac arrhythmia, bleeding disorder, chronic pulmonary disease requiring oxygen, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          7. Major surgery to the upper GI tract, or have a history of GI disease or other medical
             condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator may interfere with oral drug
             absorption

          8. A known history of allergy to paclitaxel. Participants whose allergy was due to the IV
             solvent (such as Cremophor®) and not paclitaxel will be eligible for this study.

          9. Any other condition which the Investigator believes would make a subject's
             participation in the study not acceptable
