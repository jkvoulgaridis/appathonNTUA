    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single arm, single center exploratory clinical research, to
      evaluate KN035 late treatment in patients with Multiple Primary tumors (MPC, Multiple Primary
      working) clinical benefit.In the study, all subjects meeting the criteria for inclusion will
      be enrolled in the KN035 treatment group, and patients cannot receive any other anti-tumor
      treatment during the study period.The primary endpoint of the study was defined as patients
      who could be assessed by imaging, and the optimal Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on
      RECIST 1.1 standard, while the secondary endpoint was safety (nci-ctcae 4.0), DCR (Disease
      Control Rate), DoR (Duration of Response), progression-free survival (PFS),1) Overall
      Survival and Overall Survival;The end point of the exploratory study was the correlation
      between different molecular types and the efficacy of immunotherapy.

      Patients diagnosed with advanced MPC in the study should be enrolled as:

      Histopathological diagnosis of multiple primary tumors, and is currently suffering from
      advanced colorectal cancer;Except for bowel cancer, no anti-tumor treatment is needed for
      other tumors during screening.

      The maximum time interval between screening and treatment was 2 weeks (±7 days).Efficacy and
      safety were evaluated at 4 weeks (±7 days), 8 weeks (±7 days) after treatment, and every 8
      weeks (±7 days) thereafter.Once a subject develops disease progression (based on investigator
      evaluation or imaging evidence), the subject should discontinue the study.Cessation of
      treatment for any reason should be followed by a study end visit within 4 weeks (±7) days
      after the last study administration to collect information on all possible adverse events and
      drug combinations.Drug - related or possibly related adverse events should be followed up
      until they are stable or resolved.SAE should be documented within 30 days of study
      cessation.KN035 can be used for up to 2 years.

      When desease progression is suspected, researchers are allowed to reconfirm disease
      progression after 4 weeks using irRECIST criteria.During the confirmation of disease
      progression, if the investigator decides that the subject should continue to receive KN035
      treatment, the following criteria must be met:

      The researchers assessed whether the subjects had benefited or were likely to continue to
      benefit:

      ①Subjects can tolerate study drug therapy;

      ②There were no medical events (e.g., central nervous system metastases) in which tumor
      progression was rapid or urgent intervention was required.

      Study endpoint analysis will be performed when the last patient is followed for 24 weeks or
      disease progression or death is observed.If there is still no disease progression or
      intolerable adverse reactions, the patient will continue to receive KN035 treatment until the
      disease progression, death, occurrence of intolerable adverse reactions or treatment for 1
      year (the researcher will give follow-up treatment recommendations according to the specific
      situation, if the original treatment is continued, the patient can still receive KN035
      treatment for free).Treatment options after disease progression will be implemented at the
      discretion of the investigator.After the end of the study visit, subjects will enter the
      post-study follow-up period to collect survival data OS.
