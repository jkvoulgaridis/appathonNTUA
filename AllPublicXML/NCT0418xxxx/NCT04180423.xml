  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centered prospective, consecutively enrolled study that will be conducted in
      the United States. Surgeons that are new users of the iTotal Knee system (defined by no
      experience using the customized Total Knee Replacement (TKR) in the last 6 months) will be
      involved in the study. To complete the study protocol, the center will collect baseline
      surgical and training data on 10 &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; TKR patients using the implant system the
      surgeon currently uses. Then the first 50 consecutive patients who have been identified to
      receive the iTotal implant (Cruciate-Retaining or Posterior-Stabilizing) based on patient
      factors and the implant system IFU will be enrolled in the study. Simultaneous bilateral
      Total Knee Arthroplasty cases will be excluded.

    <description>Total Knee Replacement, or knee arthroplasty, is a common surgical procedure performed to relieve the pain and disability resulting from osteoarthritis. In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee. Off-the-Shelf implants use standard sizing.</description>

In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the knee with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the knee. Customized implants are customized individually made knee implants which are designed specific to each patient's unique anatomy.</description>
