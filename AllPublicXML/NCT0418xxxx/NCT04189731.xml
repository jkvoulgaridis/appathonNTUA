  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder surgery is performed usually under interscalene block considered as a gold standard.
      This anesthesia is well suited for hospitalized patients but not for outpatients. The
      Orthopedic Surgery Department of Clinique Chénieux has been operating patients requiring
      arthroscopic shoulder surgery with a short interscalene block relayed by a long suprascapular
      block. The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of this method by measuring the
      average pain over 3 days after the operation.

    <textblock>
      The surgery of the shoulder is usually performed under interscalene block (ISB), considered
      as a gold standard. This anesthesia is well suited for hospitalized patients but not for
      outpatients. Indeed, the ISB entails, in addition to a sensory block, a motor block often
      useless and important since it extends beyond the shoulder to the entire upper limb. It can
      also be a source of anxiety and cause the risk of compression in the limb operated because of
      the extended sensorimotor block. It is also responsible for a painful bounce almost constant
      with sometimes the very rapid installation of intense pain when the effect of the sensory
      block disappears. This pain can be difficult to relieve despite frequent use of opioids.

      The Orthopedic and Traumatologic Surgery Department of the Clinique Chénieux has been
      operating patients requiring arthroscopic surgery of the shoulder according to the following
      technique. It involves the establishment of a short ISB (between 2h and 4h) relayed by a
      supra-scapular block (SSB) long (72h) through the placement of a perineural catheter thus
      allowing a continuous diffusion of Naropein® by an elastomeric pump. The same day or the day
      after the operation, the patients return to their home and are followed by nurses.

      The objective of this technique is to better manage postoperative pain, thus allowing the
      management of patients in outpatient surgery. A prospective non-interventional study will
      make it possible, in a context of common practice, to obtain data on the management of pain
      in operated patients and then to consider a generalization of this practice to other centers.
