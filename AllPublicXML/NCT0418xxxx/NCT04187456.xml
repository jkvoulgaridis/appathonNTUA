  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open label, 2 period, fixed sequence study in healthy male subjects,
      performed at a single study center in the Unites States of America. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the effect of savolitinib on the PK of midazolam, a known cytochrome P450
      (CYP) 3A substrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an open-label, 2 treatment period, fixed sequence study in healthy
      male subjects, performed at a single study center.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Two treatment periods:

      Treatment Period 1 consists of 5 days (Study Days -1 to 4), starting with admission to the
      Study Center on Study Day -1, dosing of midazolam alone on Study Day 1 and ending on Study
      Day 4, after a 3 day washout period.

      Treatment Period 2 consists of 2 days (Study Days 5 and 6), with administration of midazolam
      in combination with savolitinib on Study Day 5. Subjects will be discharged from the Study
      Center on Study Day 6, after the last PK sample is collected.

        -  The Follow up Visit will occur at least 14 days (Study Day 19 or after) after the
           administration of savolitinib in Treatment Period 2.

        -  Subjects will be admitted to the Study Center on Study Day -1, prior to the evening meal
           the night before dosing with midazolam alone (Study Day 1) and will stay in house until
           at least 24 hours after dosing with midazolam in combination with savolitinib (Study Day
           5). Subjects will thus be discharged on Study Day 6, after the last PK sample has been
           collected.

      Each subject will be involved in the study between 21 and approximately 48 days.

        rate &lt; 45 or &gt; 85 beats per minute. 9 Any clinically significant abnormalities in rhythm,
        conduction or morphology of the 12-lead resting ECG that may interfere with the
        interpretation of QTc interval changes.

          1. Abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead (V2)
             or left ventricular hypertrophy.

          2. PR interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there is no
             evidence of ventricular pre-excitation).

             [Wenckebach Phenomenon] while asleep is not exclusive) or third degree

             branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS &gt; 110 ms.
             Subjects with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence of
             e.g., ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation.

          5. Mean resting correct QT interval (QTcF) &gt; 450 ms for men on screening obtained from 3
             ECGs or history or factors that may increase the risk of QTcF prolongation such as
             chronic hypokalemia not correctable with supplements, congenital or familial long QT
             syndrome, or family history of unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
             first-degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval
