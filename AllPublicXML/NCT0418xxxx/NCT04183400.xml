  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SAFE study examines the effects of brief mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral
      intervention aimed at improving risk-related attention skills (risk detection, problem
      solving, assertiveness, and help seeking) in order to reduce substance use and victimization
      among young people (ages 18-21) experiencing homelessness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth (ages 18-21) living at a local youth shelter will be recruited and randomly assigned to
      receive the SAFE intervention (plus usual case management) or to receive usual case
      management only. Those assigned to SAFE will receive 12 mindfulness-based,
      cognitive-behavioral modules through a 3-day intensive group intervention provided by an
      agency intern and a hired project staff member. The intervention uses mindfulness-based
      cognitive-behavioral approaches to augment youth attention to risk-related processes,
      including risk detection, problem solving, assertiveness, and help seeking skills. It is
      hypothesized the intervention will result in reduced substance use and victimization and that
      these effects will be explained, at least in part, by improved risk-related attention skills
      (risk detection, problem solving, assertiveness, and help seeking skills). Post baseline
      interview, participants will be randomly assigned and will participate in a posttest
      interview (1 week post baseline) and follow up interviews at 6-weeks, 3-months, and 6-months
      post baseline interview.

    <description>Help seeking intentions will be assessed with a modified version of the General Help Seeking Questionnaire which assesses intentions to seek help from different sources for different problems. The original scale asks about seeking help for emotional problems and suicidal thoughts; our version was modified to ask about help seeking related to safety issues and substance use. Higher scores indicate greater help seeking thus a more positive outcome.</description>
