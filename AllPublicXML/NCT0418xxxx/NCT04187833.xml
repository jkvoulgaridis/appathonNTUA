  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective the study drugs, nivolumab (also known
      as Opdivo®) and talazoparib (also known as Talzenna®) are when given as a combination
      treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study team wants to know the
      effectiveness of these drugs together in treating cancer than if each study drug was given by
      itself.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, multi-institutional, open label trial in a sample size of 37
      primary or recurrent, unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients progressed on prior
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 or BRCA-ness.

      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the clinical efficacy of nivolumab plus
      talazoparib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRCA1/2 or other DNA
      damage repair mutations (defined as BRCA-ness)

      Secondary objectives and their endpoints include progression free survival (PFS) defined as
      time from first dose of treatment until disease progression, treatment related adverse
      events, anti-tumor activity , and immune-related progression free survival (irPFS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

          -  Prior anti-cancer therapy for melanoma less than 14 days prior to first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with previously
             diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and
             have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study
             enrollment, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at
             least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,

          -  Known HIV or AIDS-related illness HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             talazoparib. In addition, these subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

          -  Poorly controlled or uncontrolled autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when
             receiving an immunostimulatory agent. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition or prior therapy
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted
             to enroll. Patients with endocrinopathies controlled on replacement drugs are
             eligible.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Current use of corticosteroids at the time of study enrollment, EXCEPT for the
             following:

               -  a. Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, eye drops or local steroid injection
                  (eg, intra-articular injection)

               -  b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses ≤10 mg/day of prednisone or
                  equivalent

               -  c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan
                  premedication)

          -  Diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)

          -  Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening
             (positive HBV surface antigen or detectable HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening
             test positive).

          -  Current or anticipated use of a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor (amiodarone,
             carvedilol, clarithromycin, cobicistat, darunavir, dronedarone, erythromycin,
             indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lapatinib, lopinavir, propafenone, quinidine,
             ranolazine, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, tipranavir, valspodar, and verapamil),
             P-gp inducer (avasimibe, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John's wort), or
             inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (curcumin, cyclosporine,
             elacridar [GF120918], and eltrombopag).

          -  Inability to swallow capsules or known intolerance to talazoparib or its excipients.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because animal studies have demonstrated
             that nivolumab and talazoparib may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant
             women. Breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and
             talazoparib may be excreted in human breastmilk and the potential for serious adverse
             reactions in nursing infants.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy &gt; Grade 1.
