  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United Kingdom, there is an urgent need to reshape the National Health Service (NHS)
      workforce to equip it to meet the changing demands of the population it serves and deliver
      the vision set out in the Next Steps on the NHS Five Year Forward View (2017) and recently
      published NHS Plan (2019). One of the key elements to this is the continuing development,
      support and utilisation of Advanced Clinical Practice (ACP) roles.

      Advanced Clinical Practitioners are educated to Masters Level in clinical practice and
      assessed as competent in practice using their expert clinical knowledge and skills. They have
      the freedom and authority to act, making their own decisions in the assessment, diagnosis and
      treatment of patients.

      Although the level of education and assessment of competence are common for ACPs working in
      all areas, training and supervision varies between primary and secondary care, specialties
      and sites.

      The proposed research will explore ACP experiences of how they develop clinical competence
      and their opinions on role identity, specifically:

        -  Factors that have influenced their clinical competency achievements.

        -  Training experience (clinical and external education opportunities)

        -  Experience of educational/ clinical supervision and its benefits.

        -  Self-identified knowledge gaps, with a focus on mental health.

        -  Future ACP role identity
