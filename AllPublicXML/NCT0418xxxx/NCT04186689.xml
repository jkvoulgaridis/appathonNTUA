  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      identifying children with dental anxiety among those who suffered from food insecurity will
      enable to implement preventive strategies and early intervention. The aim of this study is to
      examine the relationship between food insecurity, maternal psychological status and child
      dental behavior.

  <detailed_description>

      A well-trained investigator will collect data on maternal age (in years), the marital status,
      the educational levels of both parents and their employment status, pregnancy information, as
      well as family structure (whether children are living with both parents or not), number of
      siblings (none, one, two, or â‰¥three). Information on family monthly income and crowding index
      which is defined as the average number of people per room, excluding both the kitchen and
      bathrooms will be also obtained.

      The level of household food insecurity will be determined using the validated Arabic version
      of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) which categorizes food insecurity into
      three levels (food secure , marginally food secure and food insecure) where the final score
      is given according to the sum of affirmative responses to the tool statements and the higher
      the score the more the level of food insecurity.

      The validated Arabic version of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale will be used to measure
      the self-reported level of stress among mothers of the enrolled children by assessing their
      feelings and thoughts during the last month. The level of child's dental anxiety will be
      assessed during the initial oral examination before starting any dental treatment procedures
      using the six-point Venham behavior rating scale which ranges from total cooperation (0) to
      no cooperation
