    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a sleep intervention with weighted blankets for children
      with ADHD and sleep problem regarding health-related outcomes, sleep, and cost-effectiveness.

      The study is an RCT with cross-over design. The participants will be randomized to start with
      an active or placebo blanket, and then change blankets during the 16 week study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited evidence about health outcomes or health-economic benefits of sleep
      interventions with weighted blankets for children with neuropsychiatric syndromes (NPS).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate a sleep intervention with weighted blankets for children
      with ADHD and sleep problem regarding health-related outcomes, sleep, and cost-effectiveness.

      The participants, n=80 children between 6 and 15 years old, will be recruited from the ADHD
      unit in DCAP (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry) and randomly assigned into two
      groups: Fiber Weighted Blankets (intervention 1) and Control Blankets (controls).

      The children will use each blanket respectively for 4 weeks, then change blankets. A long
      term follow-up will be conducted 16 weeks from baseline.
