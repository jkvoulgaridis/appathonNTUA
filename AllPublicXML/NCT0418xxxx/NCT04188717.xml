  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment in patients with chronic liver disease.
      Neurological complications (NC) occur commonly after liver transplantation. The investigators
      aim to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and predictors of neurological complications in
      both living donor and deceased donor transplantation done in the hospital. Between January
      2011 to December 2016, 253 liver transplant recipients were recruited for this study. The
      investigators recorded the incidence of neurological complications, their median time of
      onset, their relationship with etiology of chronic liver disease, and the risk factors for
      the complications. The investigators also studied the relationship of neurological
      complications with duration of hospital and ICU stay, and survival. Using multivariate
      forward regression analysis , the investigators developed a scoring system for prediction of
      neurological complications in liver transplantation.
