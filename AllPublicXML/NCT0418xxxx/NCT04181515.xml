      This study will use a stress (vs. placebo) exposure model, paired with single-session sham
      vs. active rTMS at two distinct cortical locations (dlPFC vs. mPFC in parallel groups) to
      assess whether rTMS neuromodulation at these alternative loci differentially influence
      stress-reactivity and opioid reinforcement in non-treatment seeking participants with OUD.
      Stress-reactivity will be measured using cognitive, affective, behavioral and biological
      phenotypes.

      The Competing Neurobehavioral Decisions Systems (CNDS) model of addiction suggests that
      persons with SUDs have hyperactive limbic reward circuitry and hypoactive executive control
      circuitry. CNDS theory supports targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, part of
      executive control circuit) and other cortical targets with repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS). One candidate-the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-is part of limbic
      reward circuitry and accessible using rTMS. We validated a rigorous pharmacological
      stress-induction method (yohimbine + hydrocortisone) that emulates endogenous
      stress-reactivity and have established linkages between stress-exposure, executive
      dysfunction, and drug seeking. Our lab is developing rTMS as a potential &quot;anti-stress&quot;
      neuromodulation approach in people with opioid use disorder (OUD).

      This study will use a stress (vs. placebo) exposure model, paired with single-session sham
      vs. active rTMS at two distinct cortical locations (dlPFC vs. mPFC in parallel groups) to
      assess whether rTMS neuromodulation at these alternative cortical loci differentially
      influence stress-reactivity and opioid reinforcement in non-treatment seeking participants
      with OUD. Stress-reactivity will be measured using cognitive, affective, behavioral and
      biological phenotypes.
