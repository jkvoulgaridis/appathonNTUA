  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, crossover study is to assess the bioavailability of lofexidine granules for
      reconstitution to that of an equal dose of LUCEMYRA (lofexidine) tablets under fasted
      conditions in healthy, non-tobacco-, non-nicotine-using adult male and female participants.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females, 18-50 years of age, inclusive, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of
             20.0-35.0 kg/m², inclusive.

               -  Agree to abstain from sexual intercourse from screening and throughout the
                  duration of the study.

               -  Have used and agree to continue to use a reliable method of contraception (e.g.,
                  condom with spermicide, IUD, hormonal contraceptives) for at least 30 days before
                  initial dosing and throughout the duration of the study.

                  ligation or Essure® device placement at least 3 months prior to initial dosing).

               -  At least 1 year postmenopausal and have a documented FSH level ≥ 40 mIU/mL at

             assessments performed at screening.

          4. Signed and dated informed consent form, which meets all criteria of current FDA

             of malabsorption within the last year, as determined by the Investigator.

          9. History of any psychiatric disorders occurring within the last two years that required

         11. Drug or alcohol addiction requiring treatment in the 12 months before initial dosing.

         12. History of excessive alcohol consumption (on average more than 14 units of
             alcohol/week) during the past 12 months.

             opiates and at screening only: amphetamines, barbiturates, methadone and
             phencyclidine).
