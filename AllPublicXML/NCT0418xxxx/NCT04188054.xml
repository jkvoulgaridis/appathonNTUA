  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a change in sleeping position so as to prevent the knee being 'pushed'
      into full extension when lying supine provides pain relief and/or symptom improvement in
      individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      Only those who normally sleep lying on their back will be recruited. Participants will be
      recruited into two groups: Group 1, 'intervention'; Group 2, 'control'. Participants in group
      1 will be asked to change the position they lie on their bed when sleeping; that is, to
      re-position themselves when lying on their back so that their feet (and ankles) hang over the
      end of the mattress. Participants in group 2 will be asked to make no change in the way they
      normally lie on their mattress when sleeping.

      Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire, asking them about the pain and/or
      discomfort they are currently experiencing, and their current level of physical functioning.
      The questionnaire used will be the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which
      has been widely used to assess intervention outcomes in individuals with knee OA. They will
      be asked to complete this questionnaire three times over a 4-month period; for Group 1 this
      will be before (x2) and after (x1) changing to the new sleeping position (i.e. day of
      consent, 1 month later on day of change, and 3 months after change); for Group 2 this will be
      matching the intervals in the intervention group. The primary outcome measure will be the
      KOOS Pain score, which will be compared pre and post- changing to the new sleeping position.
