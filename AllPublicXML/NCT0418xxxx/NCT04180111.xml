  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the device, CATS tonometer prism, measures
      intraocular pressure significantly differently than the current standard of care tonometer
      prism (Goldmann) before and after a corneal crosslinking procedure. This difference would be
      a measurement of the amount of corneal biomechanical changes made due to the cross-linking
      procedure.

      This clinical trial is a prospective, controlled, study and will be performed at one clinical
      investigative sites in Tucson Arizona1. The purpose of this study is to determine if the
      device, CATS tonometer prism, measures intraocular pressure significantly differently than
      the current standard of care tonometer prism (Goldmann) before and after a corneal
      crosslinking procedure. This difference would be a measurement of the amount of corneal
      biomechanical changes made due to the cross-linking procedure.
