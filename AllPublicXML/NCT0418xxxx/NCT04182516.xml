      Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study with the aim of
      exploring safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of NMS-03305293 (a PARP
      inhibitor) as single agent in adult patients with selected advanced/metastatic,
      relapsed/refractory solid tumors who have exhausted standard treatment options or for whom
      standard therapy is considered unsuitable.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria for Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Part:

             negative breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, castration-resistant prostate
             cancer (CRPC) or pancreatic cancer. BRCA mutation status is not required for
             enrollment in the Dose Escalation part, but enrichment with pathogenic BRCA carriers
             will be attempted.

          2. Patients must have progressive disease defined by RECIST 1.1 following standard
             therapy or be unsuitable for standard therapy. For CRPC patients, disease progression
             at study entry is defined as one or more of the following three criteria (according to
             PCWG2):

               -  PSA progression defined by a minimum of three rising PSA levels with an interval
                  of ≥ 1 week between each determination. The PSA value at the Screening visit
                  should be ≥ 2.0 ng/ml (µg/L). If the third PSA value is less than second PSA, a
                  fourth PSA must be repeated and if the value is higher than second it must be
                  considered as progressive disease;

               -  Soft tissue/visceral disease progression defined by RECIST 1.1;

               -  Bone disease progression defined by two or more new lesions on bone scan.

          3. Male or female patients with age ≥ 18 years.

             liposomal doxorubicin) before Cycle 1 Day 1.

          8. Prior platinum therapy is allowed provided that criteria for platinum refractory
             disease are not met (see exclusion criterion n.3).

          9. Prior treatment with PARP inhibitors is allowed in the Dose Escalation Part and
             required in two Cohorts of the Dose Expansion Part (HER2 neg breast cancer and
             epithelial ovarian cancer with prior therapy with a PARP inhibitor). It is not allowed
             in the other cohorts of patients enrolled in the Dose Expansion.

         10. Resolution of all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anticancer
             therapy to NCI CTC (Version 5.0) Grade ≤ 1 or to the baseline laboratory values as

             analysis both in dose escalation and in dose expansion.

         13. Patients must use effective contraception or abstinence. Female patients of
             childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraception or abstinence during
             the period of therapy and in the following 90 days after discontinuation of study
             treatment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective
             contraception or abstinence during the period of therapy and in the following 90 days
             after discontinuation of study treatment.

         14. Capability to swallow capsules intact (without chewing, crushing, or opening).

         15. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
