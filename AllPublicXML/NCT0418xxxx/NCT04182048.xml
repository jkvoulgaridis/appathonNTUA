  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A remote study to find out if a mobile phone application (HealthMode Stool) can serve as a
      useful tool to track and characterize daily bowel movements. The application provides
      participants with a single place to record their bowel movements either as a part of their
      general health self-monitoring, or because they may be dealing with a bowel movement
      condition. The minimal study duration is 1 month, and participants can continue using the
      application up to 2 years.
