  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending
      intradermal doses of ASP2390 in adult male and female participants allergic to house dust
      mites (HDM).

      This study will also evaluate the effect of multiple ascending intradermal doses of ASP2390
      on HDM-specific immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) levels in adult male and female
      participants allergic to HDM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening will occur up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible participants will return to
      the clinical unit on day 1.

      After the first dose on day 1, all participants will remain in the clinical unit for
      observation for approximately 24 hours postdose. After the 24 hours, participants will be
      discharged from the clinical unit provided no reactions have occurred that require additional
      observation.

      For all subsequent doses, participants will remain under direct observation for a minimum of
      1 hour postdose. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit provided no reactions
      have occurred that require additional observation.

    <description>AEs will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the event: results in death; is life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures) or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization is not caused by an AE); or other medically important events.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Subcutaneous immunotherapy systemic reaction events will be graded using the World Allergy Organization Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System.
Each grade is based on organ system involved and severity. Organ systems are defined as cutaneous, conjunctival, upper respiratory, lower respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and other. A reaction from a single organ system such as cutaneous, conjunctival or upper respiratory, but not asthma, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular is classified as a grade 1. Symptom(s)/sign(s) from more than 1 organ system or asthma, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular are classified as grades 2 or 3. Respiratory failure or hypotension with or without loss of consciousness define grade 4 and death grade 5. The grade is determined by the physician's clinical judgement.</description>
