    <description>The participants will be wearing an EEG cap and Augmented Reality headset (AR-based EEG-guided system) for 10 sessions with a licensed occupational therapist, provided in addition to usual rehabilitation care (either in inpatient rehabilitation or at home). These sessions will focus on activities of daily living that the participants want to practice. All sessions will last approximately 1 hour. These sessions will be scheduled around the existing therapy schedule to cause the least amount of interference with planned clinical activities.</description>

    <ipd_description>Recorded EEG data may be disseminated to collaborators, other researchers, or the general public, for instance via DScholarship@Pitt: University of Pittsburgh Institutional Repository or through Pitt Box. At this time, there are no specific external parties. If in the future, access to data is requested, any identifying data to will be removed from the EEG data to protect participants' privacy.</ipd_description>
