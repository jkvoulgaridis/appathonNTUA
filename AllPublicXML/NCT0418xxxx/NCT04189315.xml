        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged â‰¥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form

          -  Clinical diagnosis of pediatric-onset HPP based on signs and symptoms consistent with
             HPP

          -  Past medical history that includes at least one nonvertebral fracture (or
             pseudofracture) incurred without evidence of significant trauma.

          -  The presence of a current fracture is not necessary, but for participants with current
             unhealed fracture(s) or pseudofracture(s) of the lower extremity(ies) (that is,
             femoral, tibial, fibular, metatarsal) documentation must be provided of the presence
             of these fractures for at least 3 months prior to screening (with or without surgical
             intervention)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical condition, serious concurrent or recurrent illness and/or injury, or other
             extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly
             interfere with study compliance or the assessment of study endpoints, including all
             protocol required evaluations and follow up activities, or may put the patient at risk

          -  Primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any ingredient contained in asfotase alfa

          -  Oral bisphosphonate use within 6 to 12 months (depending on the half-life of the drug
             as assessed by the investigator) and intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate use within 12
             months prior to screening

          -  Denosumab use within 18 months prior to screening

          -  Asfotase alfa use within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Teriparatide/parathyroid hormone analog use within 2 months prior to screening

          -  Treatment with strontium or sclerostin inhibitors within 6 months prior to the first
             dose of study drug

          -  Vitamin B6 use for at least 2 weeks prior to screening

          -  Serum 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D below 20 nanogram (ng)/milliliter (mL), with
             repletion and recheck allowed at screening (results from local laboratory may be used
             if within 4 weeks of screening)

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
