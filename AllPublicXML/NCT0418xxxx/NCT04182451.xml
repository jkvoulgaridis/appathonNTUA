  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial designed to evaluate the use of Meso Wound Matrix (DSM
      Biomedical, Exton, PA) in Wagner grade 1 and 2 DFUs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Screening Visit (SV), written informed consent will be obtained from the subject by
      the Investigator or designee before the performance of any other protocol-specific procedure.
      The Investigator will select the Index (study) ulcer. Each subject will have only one DFU
      selected as the Index (study) ulcer. If the subject has more than one ulcer at the SV, the
      Investigator will select the largest ulcer that meets the eligibility criteria of the
      protocol as the Index (study) ulcer.The SV is designed to determine whether subjects are
      eligible to proceed to the Treatment Phase of the study. Those subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria will transition to Treatment Visit 1 (TV1) on the same day as the SV.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at the SV will receive Meso Wound Matrix (DSM
      Biomedical, Exton, PA) and standard of care. During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be
      evaluated on a weekly basis. Efficacy evaluations each week will include Investigator
      assessment of ulcer healing and measurements of ulcer size using digital photographic
      planimetry. Safety evaluations during the Treatment Phase will consist of adverse event
      assessments at each visit. Subjects may receive up to eight applications of Meso Wound
      Matrix. Subjects whose study ulcer does not heal after eight applications will receive only
      SOC treatment for 4 additional weeks. Subjects whose ulcers do not achieve closure at or by
      12 weeks or who experience an amputation will be deemed treatment failures.

    <description>Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will receive standard of care and Meso Wound Matrix.
The standard of care therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU, appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, and aggressive infection management with the use of appropriate dressings. Total contact casting or fixed ankle walker will be used for off-loading. Wound Matrix is an acellular scaffold to reinforce and repair soft tissue defects. Subjects may receive up to eight applications of Meso Wound Matrix. Subjects whose study ulcer does not heal after eight applications will receive only SOC treatment for 4 additional weeks.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years old

          2. Presence of a diabetic foot ulcer, Wagner 1 or 2 grade, extending at least through the
             dermis or subcutaneous tissue and may involve the tendon or muscle provided it is
             below the medial aspect of the malleolus

          3. The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if 2 or more ulcers are present on the same
             extremity. If other ulcerations are present on the same foot they must be more than 2
             cm apart from the index ulcer.

          4. Index ulcer (i.e. current episode of ulceration) has been present for greater than 4
             weeks prior to the initial screening visit

          5. Study ulcer size is a minimum of 0.75 cm2 and a maximum of 5 cm2 at first treatment
             visit

          6. Adequate circulation to the affected extremity as demonstrated by a transcutaneous
             oxygen measurement (TCOM) or a skin perfusion pressure (SPP) measurement of ≥ 30 mmHg,
             or an Ankle Brachial Index (ABI - measure of blood flow to the ankle) between 0.7 and
             ≤ 1.3

          7. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of
             contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence)

          8. Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply
             with weekly visits and the follow-up regimen

          9. Subject has read and signed the IRB approved Informed Consent Form before screening
             procedures are undertaken

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Study ulcer(s) deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other
             than diabetes.

          2. Index ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer and should
             undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma of the ulcer.

          3. Subjects with a history of more than two weeks treatment with immunosuppressants
             (including systemic corticosteroids &gt;10mg daily dose), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or
             application of topical steroids to the ulcer surface within one month prior to first
             Screening Visit, or who receive such medications during the screening period, or who
             are anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study.

          4. History of radiation at the ulcer site.

          5. Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to
             complete this study or has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.

          6. Osteomyelitis or bone infection of the affected foot or leg as verified by X-ray
             within 30 days prior to Randomization.

          7. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          8. The study ulcer with a history of treatment with hyperbaric oxygen of cellular or
             Tissue-based Product (CTP) within 30 days of randomization.
