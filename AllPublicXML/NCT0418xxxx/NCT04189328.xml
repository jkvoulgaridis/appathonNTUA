    <textblock>
      This study compares the peri-implant soft tissue and crestal bone loss around single implants
      when placed macrosurgically and microsurgically.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Black triangles in dentition especially in the anterior teeth would pose an esthetic concern.
      Interdental papilla height is crucial for eliminating this black triangle.

      32 participants, 16 in two groups were assigned randomly. Microsurgical approach using
      microsurgical instruments and magnifying loupes were used for one group participants and
      similar procedure without magnifying loupes and microsurgical instruments was done in the
      other group.

      comparsion of the microsurgical outcome is done by measuring peri implant papilla gain and
      radiographic crestal bone loss will be done between the groups.

= less than one-half of the papilla height is present, and a convex curvature of the soft tissue adjacent to the implant crown and adjacent tooth can be observed;
= at least one-half of the papilla height is present but not to the contact point between the teeth, the papilla is not completely harmonious with the adjacent papillae between the permanent teeth, and soft tissue is harmonious with adjacent teeth;
= the papilla fills the entire proximal space and is harmonious with the adjacent papillae, and soft-tissue contour is optimal;
