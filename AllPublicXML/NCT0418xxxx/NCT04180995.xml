    <textblock>
      This study is one monocentric, single-arm, open, phase Ⅱ clinical study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Toripalimab monoclonal injection (Tuo Yi) combined with axitinib
      tablet (Inlyta®) as neoadjuvant therapy for localized mucosal melanoma.

      Primary objective: To evaluate pathological complete response (pCR) rate of Toripalimab
      combined with axitinib as neoadjuvant therapy for localized mucosal melanoma.

      The subjects will receive Toripalimab and Axitinib combined therapy after enrollment, and
      receive operation 2 weeks after the last dose of Axitinib. Toripalimab will be given for a
      total of 4 cycles (8 weeks), whereas Axitinib will be given for a total of 8 weeks.The
      subjects can receive Toripalimab for up to one year after the operation.
