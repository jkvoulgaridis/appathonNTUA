  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment regimen of using Laser Interstitial
      Thermal Therapy (LITT) and Hypo-fractionated Radiation Therapy to treat patients with
      recurrent gliomas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is preferably used as an adjunct to surgery for patients with a newly
      diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. LITT offers an alternative to surgical resection, and
      due to its minimally invasive nature, does not delay initiating radiation therapy. Another
      advantage of LITT prior to radiation therapy is the ability to obtain a tissue diagnosis of
      recurrent tumor prior to initiating radiation therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with history of a WHO Grade II-IV glioma with radiographic evidence of
             recurrent or progressive tumor

               -  Patient must have received prior radiation therapy for initial treatment of
                  glioma

               -  Patients with any number of recurrences are allowed as long as the patient has
                  not undergone re-irradiation

          2. Brain MRI with contrast demonstrates an enhancing tumor ≤ 6 cm in largest diameter
             within 60 days prior to registration

          3. History and physical including neurological exam within 30 days prior to registration

             months after study completion.

          9. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within

             including any of the following:

               -  History or presence of serious uncontrolled ventricular or significant
                  arrhythmias.
