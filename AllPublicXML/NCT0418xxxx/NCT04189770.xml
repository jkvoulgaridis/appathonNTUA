  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the day-to-day stress, social support, and health lifestyle behaviors
      (such as physical activity and nutrition) in African American patients with stage 0-III
      prostate cancer survivors and their partners. How patients cope with stress may affect their
      lifestyle behaviors. This study may help understand not only survivors' behaviors but also
      partners' behaviors and how they interact.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine temporal associations between dyadic coping and health behaviors such as physical
      activity and diet.

      II. Identify social and physical contexts in which health behaviors occur/co-occur among
      survivors and their partners.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Investigate potential moderators for the associations between stress and dyadic coping.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and partners complete questionnaires over 60 minutes about demographic information,
      stress, coping, and lifestyle behaviors at baseline and end of study. Patients and partners
      also receive an accelerometer and complete Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
      questionnaire on stress, coping, physical activity, and eating behaviors over 5-10 minutes
      four time daily (QID; 7:30 am, 11:30 am, 3:30 pm, and 7:30 pm) via an smartphone application
      (app) for 14 days. Patients and partners also complete a survey on nutrition twice weekly
      (BIW) for a total of 4 surveys.

    <description>Descriptive analysis (e.g., frequency) will be conducted to examine the places (e.g., home, neighborhood) in which the health behaviors occurred and the number of health behaviors engaged alone and with others (especially with partner). Also, contexts (days of a week and times of a day and place) in which survivors and partners engaged in health behaviors together will be investigated. All analyses will be exploratory in nature.</description>
