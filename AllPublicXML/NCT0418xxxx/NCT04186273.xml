  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of daily post surgical scar
      management, using a moisture-balancing base product containing different amounts of a novel
      (NCE) antifibrogenic compound FS2, a natural metabolite of the kynurenine pathway. Results of
      recent peer-reviewed, pre-clinical evidence warrant further investigation to validate
      therapeutic scar preventive efficacy of topically administered/delivered FS2. There are no
      known safety concerns with current product formulations. Recent Phase I clinical safety and
      tolerability data further support continuation of the research proposed in this study.

      Study Arms (Investigational Conditions):

      Total of 6, categorized by type of wound and treatment allocation.

      Description of Study Arms:

      The quality of tissue repair and scarring will be evaluated in two different, bisected
      post-surgical sites on the same Participant. Each wound site represents a Study Arm. Each
      wound site will receive two treatments, one of which is always a vehicle. In total the two
      wound types provide a total of 6 Study Arms for statistical analysis.

      Arm 1 / Wound Type 1 (skin grafted wounds: 3-treatment groups): The wound site (injury) that
      requires skin grafting surgery to remove normal, uninjured skin from the same Participant to
      cover and repair a deep wound (a &quot;skin graft&quot;).

      Arm 2 / Wound Type (donor skin graft harvest site; 3-treatment groups): A surgical wound
      where a piece of normal skin is removed at uniform depth using a dermatome to harvest a skin
      graft (&quot;skin graft harvest site&quot;).

      The bisected wound site is randomly assigned either a control or FS2 cream treatment.

      Treatment Groups: Each wound site will be used to investigate and compare three different
      treatments. Participants will apply the investigated treatments (&quot;IP&quot;) as directed to
      allocated bisected sections of the skin grafted wound and donor wound site for 90 days.
      Follow-on assessments will be conducted with additional study visits on Days 180 and 270
      (study endpoint).

      There are four (4) differently labelled products as follows:

      Treatment-1 (IP1) A single, daily application of a moisturizing cream-base.

      Treatment-2 (IP2) A single, daily application of a moisturizing cream-base with FS2 (0.50%
      w/w).

      Treatment-3 (IP3) A single, daily application of a moisturizing cream-base with FS2 (0.25%
      w/w). IP3 will have two different product labels to conceal the identity of the vehicle.

      Control-cream (IP1), and treatments IP2 and IP3 each containing 0.50%w/w or 0.25%w/w FS2
      respectively, will be topically applied to designated treatment sites once per day for a
      period of 90 days. Investigator and participant will be blinded from both identity of
      treatment product and randomized location. Each participant will be provided a different
      cream for each bisected-site for a total of four (4) differently labelled creams; two for the
      donor site, and two for the skin grafted site. Participants will discuss and be
      informed/reminded at each visit about study design, responsibilities, possible adverse
      events, proper daily wound care and cream application methods.
