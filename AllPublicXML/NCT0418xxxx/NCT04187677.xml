    <description>In our study, the wrist joint's range of motion will be evaluated in 2 different directions (flexion / extension and radial / ulnar deviation) for proprioception evaluation. For evaluations of all directions, the individual will be required to bring the wrist to the end of the movement, then to perform half the normal range of motion, while the wrist is in a hanging position from the table edge to allow full movement. The difference between the angular value and the angular value created by the individual will be noted by looking at the angular value on the fixed goniometer.</description>

    <description>The Patient-Specific Functional Scale is a self-reported, patient-specific outcome measure, designed to assess functional change, primarily in patients presenting with musculoskeletal disorders. The scale was developed by Stratford et al 1995 as a self-report measure of function that could be used in patients with varying levels of independence. It was designed to provide clinicians with a valid, reliable, responsive, and efficient outcome measure that would be easy to use and applicable to a large number of clinical presentations.</description>

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First day)</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL-five-dimension (EQ-5D) is one of the most commonly used questionnaires to elicit health state utilities, having both a youth and an adult version. For general populations of adults two versions of the questionnaire have been developed, 3L and 5L, with the latter offering a more detailed description of health status. In order to use the EQ-5D to estimate quality-adjusted life-years, a value set to reflect people's preferences for different health states is needed.</description>
