  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A topical anesthetic gel lidocaine has been widely used as a local anesthetic to reduce the
      pain and discomfort. It provides local analgesia by blocking the initiation and transmission
      of impulses. Lidocaine topical anesthetic gel allows the use of high concentrations of the
      anesthetic bases without concern about local irritation, uneven absorption or systemic
      toxicity (Argoff, 2000 ). So, the aim of this study is to compare between the effect of
      lidocaine phonophoresis and pulsed ultrasound in myofascial pain syndrome in swimmers
      children.

      Fourty five children (athletic swimmers) participated in this study, and were classified into
      three groups ; First control group A : this group consisted of fifteen children were
      receiving traditional physical therapy program. Second study group B: this group consisted of
      fifteen children were receiving pulsed ultrasound in addition to traditional physical therapy
      program as the same as in group A. Third study group C: this group consisted of fifteen
      children were receiving lidocaine phonophoresis in addition to traditional physical therapy
      program as the same as in group A. Treatment program in the three groups applied three times
      a week for three successive months. The study was done in the outpatient clinic of Ismailiy
      Sporting Club, Ismailia, Egypt.
