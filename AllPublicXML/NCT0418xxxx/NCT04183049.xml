  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impact of the OFA technique on postoperative recovery from adolescent spine surgery and the
      incidence of chronic postoperative pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RACAROFA is an observational, prospective study based on the hypothesis that the OFA
      technique effectively improves the long-term postoperative rehabilitation of adolescents and
      reduces the incidence of CPSP. A prospective French multicentre study on this topic is
      currently not feasible, as other multicentre studies (pain monitoring by the ANI, blood
      saving strategy) would interfere with potential recruitment.
