    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OmegaD softgels for the
      treatment of dry eye disease. A daily dose of 2 OmegaD softgels dosed orally BID will be
      compared to 2 placebo softgels (mineral oil ) dosed orally BID for 84 days. Approximately 300
      subjects will be evaluated for their signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and for safety
      throughout the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a key component of dry eye disease. Increasing the systemic levels of omega-3
      fatty acids relative to omega-6 levels can mediate immune responses. Evaluating whether
      omega-3 supplementation can improve dry eye disease signs, symptoms and associated measures
      of inflammation may present a new therapeutic option for dry eye disease.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily
      (BID) dosing of OmegaD softgels in subjects with dry eye disease.

      Male and female subjects between 18 years and 90 years of age, with at least moderate ocular
      surface disease (OSDI ≥ 20) dry eye symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease
      supported by global clinical assessment will be screened and enrolled. Each subject must
      have, in at least one eye, tear osmolarity of ≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction as
      defined by a grade of 1 or 2 on the meibomian orifice size scale at both Screening and
      Baseline in at least one eye. In addition, Tear break up time (TBUT) must be ≤ 7 seconds in
      both eyes at Screening and the Schirmer's test score in both eye(s) must be ≥ 5 mm at
      Screening.

      Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for
      84 days (12 weeks) with either OmegaD softgels; 2 softgels BID or placebo softgels; 2
      softgels BID. The study will be double-masked with OmegaD and placebo being
      identical-appearing softgels.

      Subjects will participate in safety and efficacy assessments throughout the study. Efficacy
      assessments will include, tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, TBUT,
      Schirmer's Test, and dry eye symptoms based on the OSDI questionnaire, Safety assessments
      will include, slit lamp examination and adverse events.
