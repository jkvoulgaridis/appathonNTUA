  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many advances in our understanding of the natural history and progression of chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and cardio vascular disease (CVD) in the parent CRIC study over the past
      15 years, important questions about key risk factors for these diseases remain unanswered in
      the AI population. To address this burden of CKD in AI communities Investigators formed a
      consortium of investigators with extensive experience in conducting research of chronic
      diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disease in AIs of Southwestern US. The
      proposed CRIC ancillary cohort study of 500 AIs (AI-CRIC) will rapidly improve our
      understanding of both potential risk factors for CKD progression, as well as the scope of
      this disease among AIs. This study leverages the current CRIC study and incorporates the
      planned activities of the next phase of the study - &quot;CRIC 2018&quot; - by implementing
      contemporary CRIC protocols for kidney and cardiovascular measurement and outcomes.

  <detailed_description>

      Investigators will conduct a longitudinal study of a CKD cohort of Southwest AIs to identify
      unique risk factors for CKD and CVD progression and compare CKD and CVD event rates and risk
      factors between AI and the populations represented in CRIC. Investigators will establish a
      specimen bank to support future ancillary studies designed to identify and examine biomarkers
      associated with the progression of CKD in AIs.

      At the Clinic Visit the following will occur:

        -  weight is measured

        -  blood pressure and heart rate are recorded

        -  information about medical history and medication used recently

        -  blood draw (about Â½ cup) for the following tests: CBC (Complete Blood Count), tests of
           metabolism, and several other heart and kidney tests

        -  blood pressure in the leg and arm calculated as the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)

        -  urine sample collection for kidney function testing

        -  complete questionnaires about quality of life, diet, mood, thought processes and
           physical activity.

      This visit takes about 1 to 2 hours. Participants will be contacted by telephone six months
      after the Baseline Visit to ask about recent medical events and medications.

      Participants will be asked to return to the center for annual visits during which many but
      not all of the procedures described above will be conducted.

      Additionally, participants will be asked to participate in one of two substudies using remote
      data collection techniques to identify trajectories of kidney function and cardiovascular
      risk sub-phenotypes
