    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to investigate the upper gastro-intestinal (GI)-related
      safety and tolerability in healthy participants by gastroscopy and gastric biopsies after
      treatment with 25 milligram (mg) JNJ-67953964 once daily (QD) over 4 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Microscopic Signs of Parietal Cell Damage</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Microscopic signs of parietal cell damage is defined as the any of the following observations to be present in at least 2 biopsy specimens collected during a gastroscopy session: greater than (&gt;) 25 percent (%) decrease in the number of parietal cells from baseline in the gastric biopsies at visit 4 or multifocal to diffuse parietal cell apoptosis or degeneration.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Microscopic Signs of Ulcers or Erosions in the Gastric Biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Microscopic signs of ulcers or erosions in the gastric biopsies will be assessed by high resolution gastroscopy using the 5-point Lanza scale: 0 = normal stomach, 1= mucosal hemorrhages only, 2 = 1 or 2 erosions, 3 = numerous (3-10) areas of erosion, and 4 = large number of erosions (&gt;10) or ulcer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Gastroscopy Lanza Score Greater than or Equal to (&gt;=) 2</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric pH Before and up to 4 Hours After Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: Predose up to 4 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric pH before and up to 4 hours after dosing will be measured. To measure gastric pH a nasal-gastric tube will be placed about one hour before dosing and remain in place until 4 hours after dosing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and AEs Related to Upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>

             body weight should be 50 kilogram (kg)

             results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test before the first dose

          -  A male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for
             passage of ejaculate to another person until 90 days after receiving the last dose of
             study intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy,
             which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)

          -  History of any gastric surgery, documented gastric disease (including peptic ulcer
             disease, gastritis, achlorhydria, upper gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding, esophagitis,
             or any GI precancerous condition), current clinically evident GI complaints including
             functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID)

          -  Is positive for helicobacter (H.) pylori antigen in a stool test at screening

          -  Is diagnosed to have any gastric disease (macroscopic) as visually assessed by
             gastroscopy at screening

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive, or tests positive for
             HIV at screening
