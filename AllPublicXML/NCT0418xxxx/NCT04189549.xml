  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is to evaluate a novel biomarker - CNA Rapid Sepsis Dx - to predict the
      development of sepsis in patients admitted to the hospital with non-sepsis conditions. Using
      circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood stream, it has been demonstrated to detect
      infection response days before clinical evidence of sepsis manifests. The hypothesis is that
      blood biomarkers drawn daily in the hospital will identify patients who develop sepsis within
      seven days of hospital presentation.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational trial evaluating CNA Rapid Sepsis Dx -novel biomarkers
      (CNA Diagnostics Inc.; Calgary, Canada) based on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the
      blood stream to identify patients originally admitted with non-sepsis conditions who
      ultimately develop sepsis according to Sepsis-3 criteria within seven days of hospital
      presentation. This novel technology has been demonstrated to detect host-related response to
      infection days before clinical evidence of sepsis manifests.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the performance of the novel diagnostic
      assay, CNA Rapid Sepsis Dx, based on the biomarkers, drawn daily from the day of hospital
      presentation, to identify patients who ultimately develop sepsis according to
      Sepsis-3-definition within seven days of hospital presentation.

      The secondary objective is to correlate the CNA Rapid Sepsis Dx with clinically relevant
      outcomes such as infections that otherwise do not meet Sepsis-3 criteria, intensive care unit
      (ICU) length of stay, hospital length of stay, fluid culture results, and hospital mortality.
