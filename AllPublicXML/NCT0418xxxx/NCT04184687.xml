  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is the evaluation of both clinical and radiological results in patients
      undergone to cruciate ligament reconstruction with concomitant cartilaginous lesion treated
      with or without nanofractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anterior cruciate ligament lesion is one of the most common disease conditions in the
      orthopedic clinical practice. The mechanism of injury is due to a direct or indirect knee
      trauma causing both ligamentous breaking and surface articular stress, with cartilaginous
      lesion often associated to the lesion of the anterior cruciate ligament.

      The treatment of these lesions in combination with the treatment of the anterior cruciate
      ligament is controversial, more controversial is to understand the indication to treatment
      for these lesions.

      In order to clarify this aspect and provide a more reliable therapeutic indication for the
      treatment of the cartilaginous lesion with concomitant anterior cruciate ligament lesion we
      want to compare the clinical outcomes of the non-treated cartilaginous lesions against the
      treated cartilaginous lesions wiht nonofractures.

    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale</description>
