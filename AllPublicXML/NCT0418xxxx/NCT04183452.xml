  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the plasma concentration x time curve or Area Under the Curve (AUC)
      and the side effects reported with 250 mg intramuscular (IM) and 275 mg subcutaneous (SC)
      injections of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) is used in women with a prior preterm birth (PTB)
      as it reduces recurrences by a third. The drug is administered intramuscularly (IM) but that
      creates discomfort and in many instances requires repeated office visits as the drug is
      administered weekly from 16-20 weeks until 36 weeks or delivery. AMAG Pharmaceuticals
      obtained FDA approval to administer the drug subcutaneously (SC) based on demonstration of
      bioequivalence of a dose of 275 mg SC to a dose of 250 mg IM. That bioequivalence study was
      performed in postmenopausal women who received a single dose. This study will be performed in
      pregnant women with repeated injections both to demonstrate that equivalent exposure is seen
      and to assess the side effects and acceptance of each route of administration.

      A pharmacokinetic (PK) study will be performed after participants have reached steady state
      (after 9 injections). Participants will receive their injections from research personnel up
      until the time of completion of the PK study. Home injections will be an option for all
      participants after the PK study is completed.

    <time_frame>from study initiation until 36 weeks of pregnancy or delivery</time_frame>
    <description>If the participant elects to receive the injections at home, the individual administering the injection will be asked to complete the top portion of the Home Administration of 17-OHPC Questionnaire, which asks the person administering each weekly at-home injection to describe in their own words any problems or difficulty encountered. The participant receiving the weekly injections completes the bottom portion of the questionnaire by checking off any injection related side effects they experienced with the at-home injections.</description>

The participants will select the route of administration they prefer, IM or SC. 36 participants will receive the weekly 250 mg IM dose from 16-20 weeks of pregnancy until 36 weeks or delivery.</description>

      days during the pharmacokinetic (PK) study. A single sample will be collected at 3 additional

        This will be an open label study and participants will not be randomized to a treatment
        group. The rational for this approach is based on the expectation that the primary outcomes
        (AUC and side effects) will not be affected by provider or patient knowledge of or choice
        of treatment.

        We will approach pregnant women who are going to be treated with 17-OHPC as part of their
        standard of care and ask them to participate. Participants will select the route of
        administration they prefer, intramuscular or subcutaneous.
