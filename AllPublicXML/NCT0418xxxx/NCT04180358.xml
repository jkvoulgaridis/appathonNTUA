      Capacity Builders (CBI) will implement the Youth Builders PREIS curriculum Native Students
      Together Against Negative Decisions (Native STAND) which aims to reduce pregnancies, births,
      and sexually transmitted infections (STI's) including HIV/AIDS among high-risk youth
      populations by implementing culturally sensitive curriculum based on Navajo positive youth
      development. The study has two hypotheses: (1) Do students assigned to the Youth Builders
      program have a greater chance of abstaining from sexual activity (i.e. oral, vaginal and
      anal) in the last 3 months as compared to students assigned to the comparison group, measured
      at 12 month and 18 month follow up? (No vaginal sexual intercourse, report abstinence at 12
      and 18 random assignment month follow up); (2) Do students assigned to the Youth Builders
      program have a greater change of abstaining from sex or practicing safe sex (i.e. using a
      male or female condom, or other means of birth control if they have sex), than students
      assigned to the comparison group, measured at 12 and 18 months after random assignment? (No
      sexual activity or use contraception if engage in sex at 12 month and 18 month follow up.

      Capacity Builders (CBI) will implement the Youth Builders PREIS curriculum Native STAND,
      recruiting Navajo youth in grades 9-11 and between the ages 14-18 who attend school in the
      Consolidated School District in New Mexico. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action as a
      theoretical framework, the curriculum will be administered in classrooms over 27 sessions
      lasting 45 minutes. The curriculum will entail lessons conducted in either Physical Education
      or Health Classes and youth will be randomly assigned to two groups by the local program
      evaluator. Youth will be required to obtain signed consent and assent forms prior to
      participating in the intervention program. Youth will complete pre and post surveys to
      measure program outcomes. Random assignment will be conducted for the impact and comparison
      groups by being placed into a pool; students will be blindly pulled to become the impact
      group. Groups will be stratified to ensure balance between treatment and comparison groups.
      Quarterly evaluation reports (QERs) and an annual evaluation report will be provided to the
      Action Team for review.

      Capacity Builder's Inc. (CBI) Youth Builders PREIS program seeks to test a modification of
      the Native STAND curriculum in Northwest New Mexico with at least 834 Navajo teens and 3
      cohorts. The curriculum is intended to reduce pregnancies, births, and STI's including
      HIV/AIDS among high-risk youth populations by implementing culturally sensitive curriculum
      based on Navajo positive youth development. Additional curriculum of adulthood preparation
      subjects will increase participant knowledge in the areas of: healthy relationships,
      adolescent development, communication skills, healthy life skills. Youth Builders will be
      delivered within the traditional school day, embedded into regularly scheduled learning time.
      Presented once each week for 27 weeks over a 36-week school year, Youth Builders will reach
      students where they are, overcoming many challenges associated with retention. The project
      will support a Randomized Controlled Experimental Design. CBI will create valuable resources
      to support Youth Builders replication nationwide, including a comprehensive Youth Builders
      Blueprint, describing all action steps taken to achieve goals and objectives. In addition to
      action steps, the Youth Builders Blueprint will include: program curriculum; curricular map;
      training materials; sample parent consent forms; sample referral procedures / policies; staff
      training schedules; sample partnership agreements; Action Team meeting minutes,QERs, and
      annual evaluation reports The Youth Builders Blueprint will be available in both print and
      online format, and will be widely disseminated throughout the CBI network of non-profit
      agencies, Tribes, and school districts across the United States. Conference presentation will
      be ongoing at state and national conferences.

    <intervention_model_description>CBI will implement the Youth Builders PREIS Native STAND curriculum, a comprehensive sexual health curriculum designed for Native high school students that focuses on STI's, HIV/AIDS, and teen pregnancy prevention and covers drug and alcohol use, suicide, and dating violence. Twenty-seven sessions support healthy decision-making through interactive discussions and activities that promote diversity, self-esteem, goals and values, team building, negotiation and refusal skills, and effective communication. Youth Build will enroll 834 youth in 3 cohorts with 42 clusters of 20 students, each who will be randomly assigned to an impact or a comparison group. Students will complete pre and post survey questionnaires and be provided incentives to maintain program participation. The program will have 4 staff: Project Director, Project Coordinator, and 2 Prevention Educations responsible for collecting data and tracking progress as well as implementing the curriculum</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The impact group who is randomly selected will receive the intervention in Physical Education and Health Education classes. The control group will receive the general health and physical education curriculum provided by New Mexico's Public Education Department. No students will take a class twice unless there is a failing grade. Student will be tracked throughout the school year to ensure there is no cross contamination. Additionally, Counselors will work closely with Capacity Builder's program staff to ensure that in between semesters, students will remain in their original group. Program staff will double check at the beginning of each semester to crosswalk student assignments. Additionally, participants in the past Capacity Builder's Inc. Teen Pregnancy Prevention programs will be excluded to minimize the risk that the comparison group participants are exposed to teen pregnancy prevention curricula and, thus, to increase contrast between the intervention and control conditions.</masking_description>
