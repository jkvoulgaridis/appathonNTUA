  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is performed on a single-center retrospective cohort of 32 patients LBC-TJ treated
      with R-chemotherapy for which data collection was carried out in homogeneous and
      prospectively followed according to international standards through RCP monthly cutaneous
      lymphomas managed by Professor Beylot-Barry and inclusion of cases in the national database
      of rare cancer network French Study Group of Cutaneous Lymphomas in Bordeaux managed by Prof.
      Beatrice Vergier. Fourteen patients responded to the R-PCT against 18 non-responders, 14
      patients for whom we have the sample to recidivism.

      The objective is to identify predictive biomarkers of response to R-chemotherapy and
      understand what genomic markers, transcriptomic or proteomic would identify those patients
      ahead. This would ultimately help to identify whether dysregulated biological pathway could
      be targeted specifically among patients with personalized treatment.

      Like its counterpart systemic Lymphoma Diffuse large B cell, the sequential analysis of the
      same patient at diagnosis and relapse can also identify candidate genes and biological
      pathways involved in recurrence and help to design new therapeutic strategies.

      Another objective is ultimately the development of an integrative bioinformatics tool for
      anticipating the therapeutic response. The tumor model used is certainly a rare cancer but
      prototypical ABC lymphomas allowing access to relapse hardware and relative homogeneity that
      will allow a study of a smaller number of cases for the development of correlations models
      genomics / proteomics. This is a pivotal project integrating proteomic data and Molecular
      Biology (mutation, expression) based on the pooling of skills of clinical teams, biological
      and bioinformatics to validate a predictive model for treatment response able to integrate
      prognostic markers known as TNM the dual expression MYC / BCL2 and forward to predict the
      therapeutic response using this modeling by CBIB. We would then validate the model
      established in this series of training on a range of national validation as part of an
      observational study with GFELC (Groupe Français d'Etude des Lymphomes Cutanés).

    <description>To characterize the tumours, a sequencing of dedicated lymphopanel targeting the most frequently altered genes in large B-cell lymphomas was performed. Several highly recurrent mutations of MYD88, PIM1, CD79B and MYC, as well as CDKN2A, BLIMP1 and TNFAIP3 deletions were detected per patient leading to the putative deregulation of several biological pathways. These sequencing data have evidenced the genetic diversity and complexity of PCLBCL, LT mutational landscape.</description>

    <description>RNA-seq, central pivot between genomics and proteomics allows to make the connection between the observed mutations and alteration of protein expression with the identification and quantification of RNA. Thus, we can attest to the expression of mutations identified on DNA, protein and understand whether deregulation is linked to dysregulation of transcription or post-translational modification</description>
