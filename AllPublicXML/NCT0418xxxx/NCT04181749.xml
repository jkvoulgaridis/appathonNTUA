    <textblock>
      The P-VECT Study proposes to test the use of CCTA-derived FAI measurements in a group of
      patients with coronary artery inflammation, who will receive routinely-used statin and
      aspirin treatment. The P-VECT Study is a pilot study that will provide the rationale and data
      for power calculations to enable design of pivotal trials of the clinical effectiveness of
      FAI.

    <textblock>
      In this research we will study the ability of coronary CT angiography (CCTA)- derived Fat
      Attenuation Index (FAI) measurements to detect changes in coronary artery inflammation
      following treatment with atorvastatin and aspirin . CT scan images are used to evaluate the
      presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the wall of the coronary arteries. The new CCTA
      technique, FAI, detects and quantifies coronary artery inflammation by analysis of the
      characteristics of the adipose tissue (fat) around the wall of the artery - the peri-vascular
      adipose tissue (PVAT) This is a pilot study, involving patients undergoing a clinically
      indicated CCTA as part of their routine clinical care who are shown (on their scans) to have
      mild coronary artery plaques (&lt;50% luminal stenosis) with a high FAI value (&gt;70.1 HU).
      Patients will have 6 visits (one of which screening) with hospital attendance on 3 occasions
      for blood tests and drug supply. The pilot study will provide the rationale for power
      calculations from which further studies can be developed to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of FAI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants must satisfy the following conditions:

          1. Male or Female, aged 30 to 80 years,

          2. CCTA scan showing mild coronary artery plaques (&lt;50% luminal stenosis) with a high FAI
             value (&gt;70.1 HU) within last 3 months.

          3. No definite clinical indication for statin treatment (i.e. do not have either
             cholesterol &gt;6.5 mM, or cholesterol &gt;5.0 mM and QRISK score &gt;10%).

          4. Clinical equipoise for statin and aspirin treatment, as determined by the local
             treating physician. In these patients, there is clinical equipoise because routine
             treatment with aspirin and statin is not mandated by current guidelines, but the
             presence of minor coronary artery plaques is frequently interpreted by clinicians as
             an indication for aspirin and statin treatment. Accordingly, some patients in this
             group typically receive aspirin and statin treatment, whereas others do not.

          5. Willing and able (in the Investigators opinion) to comply with all study requirements.

          6. Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be
             notified of any incidental findings.

          7. Able to understand both verbal or written English

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant may not enter the study if ANY of the following are known to apply:

               1. Previous documented history of coronary artery disease requiring treatment. This
                  includes any of the following:

                  Acute myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary revascularization procedure
                  Clinically significant coronary artery disease diagnosed by invasive or
                  non-invasive testing.

               2. Known diabetes mellitus

               3. Definite clinical indication for statin treatment (i.e. has either cholesterol
                  &gt;6.5 mM, or cholesterol &gt;5.0 mM and QRISK score &gt;10%).

               4. Treatment with aspirin, statin or any prescribed lipid modification therapy in 6
                  weeks before baseline CCTA

               5. Atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal or persistent)

               6. History of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure within
                  the past 12 months of consent.

               7. Autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy or systemic corticosteroid
                  therapy

               8. Active treatment with any anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. NSAIDs, corticosteroids)

               9. Active neoplasm requiring surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation within the prior 12
                  months (subjects with a history of malignancy who have undergone curative
                  resection or otherwise not requiring treatment for at least 12 months prior to
                  screening with no detectable recurrence are allowed)

              10. Contraindication for aspirin and/or statin therapy

              11. Severe Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30
                  mL/min/1.73 m² and/or serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL or 220 µmol/l).

                  [ALT] &gt; 3 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] measured on local labs in last 6
                  months)

              13. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that,
                  in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude safe completion of the study.

              14. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
                  Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in
                  the study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability
                  to participate in the study.

              15. Participants who have participated in another research study involving a
                  treatment intervention or an investigational product, in the past 12 weeks.

              16. Patients unable to understand verbal or written English.

              17. Contraindication to contract dye for CCTA.

              18. Pregnancy
