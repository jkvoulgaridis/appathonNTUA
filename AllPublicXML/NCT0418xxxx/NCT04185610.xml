  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will include up to 25 patients with cancer experiencing chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neuropathy. Patients enrolled in the study will participate in a 10-week QiGong
      for Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy program. Patients will be evaluated before and after
      their program participation. Within 2 weeks before the program start date, patients will be
      administered an objective neuropathy assessment by a physician or nurse, and will complete
      questionnaires assessing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, perceived cognitive
      functioning, quality of life, and cancer-related symptoms. Patients will repeat these
      assessments at the end of the last QiGong class and will be asked to provide feedback on the
      QiGong program as a whole. Self-report questionnaires will also be repeated one week after
      the last class.

      Total duration of subject participation will be 11-13 weeks. Total duration of the study is
      expected to be approximately 9 months.

Participants will also be asked 4 additional questions about the class. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 10, and higher score means a better outcome.
A composite of all the scores for each participant will be calculated, with higher scores indicating a better outcome.</description>
