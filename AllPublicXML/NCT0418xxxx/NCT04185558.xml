  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, single blinded
           clinical study consisting of 150 subjects from up to 20 centers.

        -  The subjects are randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments, either with ActiGraft and
           standard of care (SOC) or with SOC alone.

        -  The target ulcers are evaluated weekly by the investigator. The subject is treated once
           a week, to receive weekly applications of the ActiGraft + SOC or SOC until for up to 12
           weeks or until the study ulcer has completely healed (i.e., 100% closure as assessed by
           the Investigator and blinded assessor and confirmed 2 weeks later at the healing
           confirmation visit (HCV). One additional visit per week is optional for both arms, for
           the purpose of changing only (1) the secondary dressing in the ActiGraft arm or (2)
           change the standard of care dressing in the control arm.

        -  Immediately after the study ulcer is confirmed as completely healed, subjects will enter
           the 12-week Follow-up Phase. During the Follow-Up phase, subjects will be evaluated
           twice during the first month and then monthly for two additional visits every 4 weeks
           until the completion of the 12-week Follow-up Phase.

             toes but including those of the heel) and depth ≤ 5 mm with no exposed capsule, tendon
             or bone and no tunneling, undermining or sinus tracts (Minor tunneling and undermining

             first day of screening (i.e., day -14). Subjects will need to meet all inclusion
             criteria, including lack of ulcer healing until randomization day.
