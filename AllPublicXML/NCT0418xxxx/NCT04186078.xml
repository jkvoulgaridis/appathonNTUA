  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an extremely common
      medical disorder associated with important morbidity. The purpose of this study is to
      understand the clinical features and course of patients with sleep apnea in Korea.
      Participants who are suspected of sleep apnea due to symptoms such as snoring, witnessed
      apneas, waking up with a choking sensation, excessive sleepiness, non-restorative sleep,
      difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, fatigue or tiredness, and morning headache will
      be prospectively recruited at the outpatient clinic of Seoul National University Hospital.
      After polysomnography (PSG) or respiratory polygraphy, patients with sleep apnea including
      OSA and central sleep apnea (CSA) will be followed regularly. Participants not having sleep
      apnea (apnea-hypopnea index &lt; 5/hour) will only have a baseline visit. For only participants
      with the informed consent of donating blood, their blood samples will be collected and stored
      in the Seoul National University Hospital-Human Biobank (SNUH-HUB).
