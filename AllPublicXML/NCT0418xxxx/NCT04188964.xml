    <description>Pediatric subjects &gt; = 6 months to &lt; 12 months will receive a starting dose of 0.4mg/kg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 64 weeks with the option of the dose to be increased to 0.8mg/kg upon recommendation of the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB). The dose can be either increased up to a maximum of 2 mg/kg or decreased to 0.2 mg/kg depending on serum phosphate response. Upon recommendation of the DSMB subjects &lt; 6 months can then start at 0.4mg/kg starting dose administered subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 64 weeks with the option to be increased to 0.8mg/kg upon recommendation of the DSMB and can be either increased up to a maximum of 2 mg/kg or decreased to 0.2 mg/kg depending on serum phosphate response.</description>

          2. Pediatric subjects with PHEX mutation or variant of uncertain significance in either
             the subject or a directly related family member with appropriate X-linked inheritance.

          3. Presenting serum phosphate levels below the age-specific LLN at Screening.

          4. A legally authorized representative has provided written informed consent prior to any
             research-related procedures.

          5. A legally authorized representative must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be

             schedule, and comply with the assessments required by the study protocol, including
             providing access to prior medical records for the collection of historical growth,
             biochemical, and radiographic data and disease history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

         10. Metabolic bone disease, nutritional rickets and/or osteopenia of other origin than XLH
             at Screening and/or Baseline.

         11. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) below the LLN that are clinically
             significant in the opinion of the Investigator.

         12. Evidence of any hyperparathyroidism not associated with XLH as determined by the
