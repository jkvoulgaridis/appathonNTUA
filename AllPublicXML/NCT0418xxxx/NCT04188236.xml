          -  Posterolateral disc herniation at one level between L4 and S1 with radiographic
             confirmation (CT and/or MRI) of neural compression.

          -  At least six weeks of failed conservative treatment prior to surgery, including
             physical therapy, use of anti-inflammatory medications at maximum specified dosage
             and/or administration of epidural/facet injections.

          -  Minimum posterior disc height of 5 mm at the index level.

          -  Radiculopathy with positive straight leg raise test.

          -  ODI score of at least 40/100.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary informed consent to participate in the
             clinical investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Spondylolisthesis and/or instability at the index level.

          -  Foraminal, extra-foraminal or central disc herniation.

          -  Subject has clinically compromised vertebral bodies in the lumbosacral region due to

             (e.g., osteophytes).

          -  Endplate irregularities that, in the judgment of the surgeon, could affect the device
             implantation.
