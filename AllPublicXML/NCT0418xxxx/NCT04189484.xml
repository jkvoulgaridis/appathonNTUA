    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of evolocumab and
      alirocumab across an appropriate dose range to inform clinical trial operating
      characteristics for future clinical pharmacology pharmacodynamics similarity studies.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel arm study in 72 healthy
      subjects assigned to one of four dose groups (low, intermediate low, intermediate high, and
      high) of each drug (evolocumab and alirocumab ) or placebo.

      This study is designed to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of evolocumab and
      alirocumab, two monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
      type 9 (PCSK9), across an appropriate dose range to inform clinical trial operating
      characteristics for future clinical pharmacology pharmacodynamics similarity studies.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel arm study in 72 healthy
      subjects assigned to one of four dose groups (low, intermediate low, intermediate high, and
      high) of each drug (evolocumab or alirocumab) or placebo. Evolocumab doses are 21, 35, 70,
      and 140 mg. Reslizumab doses are 15, 25, 50, and 100 mg . Each arm will include 8 subjects (4
      male and 4 female).

      Subjects will be admitted for treatment on day -1 and receive a single dose of study drug or
      placebo on day 1. Depending on the treatment arm, subjects will remain in confinement for one
      week and continue follow-up through day 42, 56, or 84.

      Blood samples (approximately 5 mL per sample) will be collected for determination of plasma
      concentrations for study drug. Additional blood samples will be collected for lipid analysis
      and determination of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB)
      (5 mL per sample; pharmacodynamic measure) and exploratory proteomics analyses (5 mL per
      sample).

      Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, and
      physical examinations. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator or
      clinical research unit (CRU) staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed
      consent is signed and before study drug application will be recorded as medical history.

    <masking_description>The pharmacist (and designated staff member responsible for confirmation of study drug dose) will be unblinded to subject treatment assignment; however, the pharmacist will not perform any study procedures other than study drug preparation and dispensing.
Subjects and staff will be blinded to treatment assignment during confinement. The blind will be maintained through a randomization schedule held by the dispensing pharmacist. Subjects and staff will be informed of a subject's end of study day when discharged from confinement. Subjects and staff will not be informed of the specific treatment arm assignment. The clinical research nurse will administer the subcutaneous study drug in unit dose containers that are not transparent.</masking_description>

                  treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies,
                  poorly controlled HIV, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune
                  weakening medications

               -  People with liver disease

         13. Subject has any signs or symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19. Per current CDC

             or difficulty breathing, or at least two of the following symptoms: fever, chills,
             repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat or new loss of
             taste/smell. In addition, the subject has any other findings suggestive of COVID-19
             risk in the opinion of the investigator.

         14. Subject tests positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
             (SARS-CoV-2) by a molecular diagnostic test performed prior to admission.

             investigator.

         17. Subject has a positive test result at Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             1 or 2 antibody, hepatitis C virus load, hepatitis C virus antibodies, or hepatitis B
             surface antigen.

         18. Subject is unable or unwilling to undergo multiple venipunctures for blood sample
             collection because of poor tolerability or poor venous access.

         19. Female subjects are pregnant or lactating before enrollment in the study
