  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how two different forms of semaglutide reach and stay in the blood
      after injection. None of the two forms of semaglutide have been approved by the authorities
      to treat obesity, but it has been approved as a treatment for diabetes mellitus. Participants
      will get 1 of the 2 forms of semaglutide - which one is decided by chance. Participants will
      get the medicine as an injection under the skin of the belly using a pen-injector. The type
      of pen-injector is different for the two forms of semaglutide. The study staff will teach
      participants how to inject the medicine. Participants will take an injection once a week and
      will get a total of 21 injections of study medication. The study will last for about 27-30
      weeks. Participants will have 25 study visits with the study doctor. For 2 of the visits,
      participants will stay in the clinic for 3 days and 2 nights. Participants may have to stop
      the study if the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Women cannot take
      part if they are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study
      period.
