      Comparison of a non-invasive method of measuring central venous pressure to the conventional
      modality of invasive central venous pressure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conventional method used to measure central venous pressure has limitations since it is
      an invasive procedure that requires a central venous catheter. To overcome this challenge, a
      new technology to assess CVP non-invasively using an oscillometric method is being developed.
      It is called enclosed zone central venous pressure (ezCVP). A comparison study of ezCVP and
      CVP is needed to determine accuracy and reproducibility.
