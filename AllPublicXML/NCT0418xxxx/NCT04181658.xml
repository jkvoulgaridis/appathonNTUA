  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot work will determine the feasibility of tDCS intervention as an effective adjunct
      intervention to PT aimed at improving gait, balance, and mobility in older adults at risk of
      falling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are correlated with both physical and cognitive declines in older adults. Recurrent
      fallers and those at high risk of falls are often referred to physical therapy (PT) for gait
      and balance training. Although physical therapists are aware of the importance of cortical
      control of gait and balance, there is no available tool to directly yet non-invasively
      intervene brain in the clinical setting.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive and safe mean of modulating
      the excitability of specific brain regions and their connected neural networks. Our group and
      others have shown that tDCS intervention designed to facilitate the excitability of the left
      dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) improves numerous aspects of executive function
      related to mobility in older adults. However, no studies to date have assessed the
      feasibility and effectiveness of applying tDCS as an adjunct to PT to improve gait and
      balance within the geriatric rehabilitation setting.

      This study aims to 1) assess the feasibility of implementing tDCS prior to each of their
      first 10 PT sessions, and 2) gather estimates of variability in outcomes related to gait,
      balance, cognition, and quality of life over time within older adults referred to PT for
      recurrent falls.

    <description>This arm combines tDCS and Physical Therapy intervention. The real tDCS will be delivered before each physical therapy visit for up to 10 combined sessions. The tDCS montage was designed to target the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for around 20 minutes. The direct current delivered by any electrode will not exceed 2.0 milliamp(mA) and the total amount of current from all electrodes will not exceed 4 mA.</description>

    <description>This arm combines sham stimulation and Physical Therapy intervention. The sham stimulation will be delivered before each physical therapy visit for up to 10 combined sessions. We will use an active sham stimulation in which very low-level currents (0.5 mA total) will be transferred between electrodes in close proximity on the scalp throughout the entire 20-minute session. This montage was designed to deliver currents not significantly influence their cortical tissue, but still, mimic the cutaneous sensations induced by tDCS over the same brain site (i.e. left DLPFC).</description>
