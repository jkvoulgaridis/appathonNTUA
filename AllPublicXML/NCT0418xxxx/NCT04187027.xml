      This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy on
      neurogenic bladder in children with myelomeningocele .Intervention: A pretest-post test
      controlled study was conducted in out-patient clinic in faculty of physical therapy Cairo
      university.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myelomeningocele is the most common cause of neurogenic bladder in children. Bladder function
      in these children is affected by disordered innervation of detrusor muscle and external
      urethral sphincter that may lead to hydronephrosis. Thirty myelomeningocele children with
      neurogenic bladder were enrolled in this study and were assessed for eligibility. Their aged
      between 4 and 12 years. They were divided randomly into two groups. Group (A) which is the
      control group received medical care and standard urotherapy only. And Group (B) which is the
      study group received medical care and standard urotherapy in addition to pulsed
      electromagnetic field therapy for three successful months. All children were assisted using
      urodynamic studies before and after three months of intervention.

    <description>magnetic field stimulation (MFS) is a novel technique for stimulating the nervous system non-invasively, which can activate deep neural structures via induced electric currents, without pain and discomfort. Also, several clinical trials including placebo-controlled studies have shown that MFS of the pelvic floor and sacral roots is effective for overactive bladder (OAB). MFS induces inhibitory effects on detrusor overactivity in a similar manner to electrical stimulation, with significant clinical advantages. MFS of the sacral nerve roots could be a promising alternative treatment for OAB.</description>
