      The purpose of this study is to test a combination treatment of acalabrutunib when given
      together with rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide (R-ICE) to evaluate if it will be
      able to improve durable responses and cure some patients.

             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (in accordance
             with national and local subject privacy regulations).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             chemotherapy program with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with acalabrutinib R-ICE, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with acalabrutinib R-ICE.

             with the exception of palliative radiation therapy (RT).

         10. Uncontrolled Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia or immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)
             resulting in (or as evidenced by) declining platelet or Hgb levels within the 4 weeks
             prior to first dose of study drug.

         13. History of prior malignancy, with the exception of the following:

               1. Malignancy treated with curative intent felt to be at low risk for recurrence by
                  treating physician,

                  disease.

         14. Currently active clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as
             defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification, or history of
             myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months

         15. Unable to swallow capsules, or disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function or, resection of the stomach or small bowel, or symptomatic inflammatory
             bowel disease or ulcerative colitis, or partial or complete bowel obstruction.

         16. Serologic status reflecting active hepatitis B or C infection. Patients that are
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or
             hepatitis C antibody will need a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to
             enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded.) Hepatitis C antibody positive
             patients are eligible if PCR is negative. Hepatitis B core antibody (+) patients
             without evidence of HBsAg or Hep B PCR (+) are eligible with appropriate Hepatitis B
             reactivation prophylaxis.

         17. History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to enrollment.

         18. Current life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction

             the levels dictated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria with the exception of
             alopecia.

         22. Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) or hemophilia.

         23. Unwilling or unable to participate in all required study evaluations and procedures.

         24. Currently active, clinically significant hepatic impairment (≥ moderate hepatic
             impairment according to the NCI/Child Pugh classification.
