  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Bone Mineral Strength Index (BMSi) between the two groups, assessed by microindentation (OsteoProbe®).</measure>
    <time_frame>1. October 2019 - 31.July 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in BMSi between the HPP- and Control-Group will be evaluated by microindentation (OsteoProbe®).
Microindentation is a technology directly measuring bone strength by a minimal invasive technique. By applying a standardized pressure with a probe, which at the same time measures the indentation depth in the tibia bone, a measure of bone strength is obtained and calculated as Bone Mineral Strength Index (BMSi) [1].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between BMSi and fracture prevalence in the HPP-Group and the Control-Group.</measure>
    <time_frame>1. October 2019 - 31.July 2020</time_frame>
    <description>BMSi will be evaluated by microindentation (described above). In addition, information about the occurrence of fractures in the HPP- and Control-Group will be obtained by data from the Danish National Patient Register and a structured clinical interview.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of differences in bone microarchitecture between the HPP- and Control-Group by high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT).</measure>
    <time_frame>1. October 2019 - 31.July 2020</time_frame>
    <description>To asses differences in bone architecture between the two groups, the non-dominant distal radius and non-dominant distal tibia will be examined by HRpQCT, which will provide data about total, trabecular and cortical BMD, trabecular thickness, cortical thickness, trabecular number, stiffness and finite element failure load of the radius and tibia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of differences in bone homeostasis between the two groups by biochemical analysis of different bone markers (P1NP, CTx, BALP, Trab-5, Sclerostin, Osteocalcin and FGF23)</measure>
    <time_frame>1. October 2019 - 31.July 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be collected for biochemical analysis of different bone markers (P1NP, CTx, BALP, Trab-5, Sclerostin, Osteocalcin and FGF23).
BALP = Bone specific alkaline phosphatase CTx = Carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks FGF-23 = Fibroblast growth factor 23 P1NP = Procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide Trab-5 = Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5</description>
