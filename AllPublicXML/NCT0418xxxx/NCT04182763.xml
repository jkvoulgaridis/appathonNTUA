  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people with the condition pantothenate
      kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) respond to a specialized study product. We are
      hoping to find out if the study product is safe, what effects—good and bad—the study product
      causes, and whether the study product changes certain measures of PKAN disease.

             likely pathogenic mutations, or (b) typical findings on exam and brain MR imaging with
             only one pathogenic mutation +/- a second likely pathogenic or VOUS in PANK2, or (c)
             typical findings on exam and brain MR imaging with a single likely pathogenic or VOUS
             in PANK2, or (d) be a symptomatic sibling of a proband subject meeting a, b or c.

          -  Be between 3 months old and 89 years old.

          -  Be able to take study product by mouth or feeding tube.

          -  Be willing and able to complete study procedures / telephone visits / blood draws
             independently, OR have a caregiver / parent willing and able to assist with these
             tasks.

          -  Be enrolled or willing to enroll in the PKANready natural history study (eIRB 10832).

          -  Be resident in North America (US or Canada) for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had exposure to a putative PANK2 bypass therapeutic agent in the 30 days prior to
             screening.

          -  Be concurrently enrolled in another interventional clinical trial.

          -  Have concurrent medical or other condition expected to preclude completion of study
             procedures of confound the assessment of clinical and laboratory measures of safety.
