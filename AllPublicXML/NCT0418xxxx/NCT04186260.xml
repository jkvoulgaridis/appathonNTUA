  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a small Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study design, PNPLA3 risk allele carriers
      (CG/GG genotype) with NAFLD, will be assigned 2:1 to a tailored NAFLD-specific weight loss
      intervention compared to a wait-list control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Mexican-American population accounts for 64.3% of the U.S. Hispanic population and is the
      fastest growing Hispanic subgroup. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic
      disease associated with obesity that is highest in the nation for Mexican-American men. NAFLD
      consists of a spectrum of conditions, ranging from fatty liver to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
      Lack of physical activity and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption are risk factors for NAFLD
      and are highly evident in the Mexican-American male population. Additionally,
      Mexican-American men are at increased risk of NAFLD and liver cancer if they are carriers of
      a version of a gene (PNPLA3) found to increase risk and severity of NAFLD. In the absence of
      prescription medications, weight loss due to changes in diet and physical activity is
      recommended for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Changes in lifestyle that result in
      &gt;5% body weight loss have been shown to improve levels of liver fat and even reverse the
      condition. Despite the clear need to develop effective intervention strategies for
      Mexican-American men, no studies to date have explored the use of health risk assessment
      strategies, including genetic risk, to motivate behavior change to reduce the risk of NAFLD
      in Mexican-American men. Consequently, this will be the first weight loss intervention for
      Mexican-American men to incorporate genetic predisposition and lifestyle risk factors of
      NAFLD (e.g., dietary sugar consumption), as a strategy to improve engagement in weight loss
      and weight maintenance behaviors.

    <intervention_model_description>The pilot study uses a small randomized-controlled trial (RCT) design that will be conducted in two phases. The first phase includes recruitment, screening, and baseline assessment procedures. The second phase will include PNPLA3 risk allele carriers (CG/GG genotype) with NAFLD, who will be assigned 2:1 to a NAFLD-specific weight loss intervention tailored for Mexican-American men, including informing them of their lifestyle and genetic risk, for 12-months compared to a wait-list control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will attend 12 weekly 30-45-minute individual counseling sessions and receive tailored lesson materials focused on behavioral strategies for adopting and maintaining healthy eating and physical activity (PA) behaviors. Participants will self-monitor their body weight, eating, and PA behaviors in a weekly journal. Dietary recommendations will follow nutritional guidelines for the treatment of NAFLD. To facilitate the adoption of the dietary recommendation, participants will be provided culturally-tailored meal plans and grocery lists that allow them to make small, practical dietary changes of ~100 calories. Participants will be prescribed weekly exercise goals with the duration increasing from 15-45 minutes, 5 days/week, over the 12-month program. After the completion of 12 weekly individual counseling sessions, participants will complete a 12-week follow-up including bi-weekly phone calls, followed by a 6-month follow-up period in which no intervention contact is made.</description>
