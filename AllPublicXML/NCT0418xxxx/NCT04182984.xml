    <textblock>
      This study collects the clinical data of new-onset ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) patients,
      assesses outcomes and adverse effects of different treatment options, and evaluate risk
      factors of conversion to generalized MG(GMG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational cohort trial in the real-world clinical setting
      recruiting new-onset OMG patients from Neurology Departments of 7 hospitals in different
      regions of China. Clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, chest imaging and history
      of thymectomy are recorded. Treatment option are determined according to the physician's
      judgment and preferences of the patients. Patients are followed up prospectively on regular
      to assess the outcomes of treatments and monitor any side effects. Peripheral blood samples
      are collected annually. The investigators plan to recruit a final sample of 200 patients for
      analysis.

    <description>The improvement of clinic status of OMG patients was assessed by investigators according to QMG and ARS-MG score. The QMG is a 13-item scale which measures ocular, bulbar, limb function and respiratory function. The total score ranges from 0 (no myasthenic findings) to 39 (maximal myasthenic deficits) obtained by summing the responses to each individual item.The ARS-MG is a 8-item scale which has a more detailed measure to assess ocular function . The total score ranges from 0 (no myasthenic findings) to 60 (maximal myasthenic deficits) obtained by summing the responses to each individual item.</description>

    <description>The improvement of clinic status of OMG patients was assessed by patients themselves according to MG-ADL score. The The MG-ADL is an 8-item scale to assess symptoms of myasthenia gravis patients obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (Grades: 0,1,2,3). The score ranges from 0 to 24.</description>
