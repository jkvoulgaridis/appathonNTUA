  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2, First-In-Human study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of EO2401 in Metastatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma, or
      Malignant Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EO2401 is an innovative cancer peptide therapeutic vaccine based on the homologies between
      Tumor Associated Antigens and microbiome-derived peptides that will be administered in
      combination with nivolumab to generate preliminary safety and efficacy data in patients with
      Metastatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma, or Malignant Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma.

             carcinoma.

          3. For inclusion in Cohorts 3A and 3B patients should have histologically confirmed (at
             primary diagnosis) unresectable malignant (defined as metastatic disease, i.e.
             presence of chromaffin tissue in non-chromaffin organs)
             pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, and RECIST defined progression should have been
             documented during a maximum of an 18-months period.
