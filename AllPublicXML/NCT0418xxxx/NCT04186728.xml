  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium is a mineral which is essential to many of the processes which happen in the body.
      This includes normal function of muscles; including the heart. Studies have shown that oral
      magnesium supplementation can help reduce the frequency of extra heart beats (premature
      ventricular contractions (PVC) and premature atrial contractions (PAC)) while also reducing
      the severity of their associated symptoms. Oral magnesium supplementation has yet to be
      investigated in athletes with lots of PVCs and/or PACs.

      Most of the magnesium in your body is stored in the bones. Your body may take magnesium from
      your bones to maintain magnesium levels in your blood. This makes it possible for people to
      have low levels of magnesium in their body but normal levels in their blood. Over time, this
      process can decrease the total amount in your body and impact other body functions. Magnesium
      is also lost in sweat making athletes more vulnerable to having low levels in their body.

      Magnesium is particularly important in the function of the myocardium (heart muscle fibers).
      It has been proposed that the PVCs and PACs experienced by some people are a result of low
      levels of total body magnesium. Current drug treatments to control PVCs and PACs include
      medications such as beta blockers. These treatments are not without their side effects.
      Generally, these medications are only effective if individuals do not have a structural heart
      disease. These drugs may also decrease your ability to exercise and are banned by some
      governing bodies in sport.

      The hypotheses of this study are:

        1. Oral magnesium supplementation reduces the frequency of PVCs and/or PACs.

        2. Oral magnesium supplementation reduces the symptoms associated with PVCs and PACs.

      To be eligible for the study, individuals will be required to have a certain number of PVCs
      and PACs in a day. This study will involve two groups of participants. A total of 25
      participants will be recruited for each group resulting in 50 participants in the study.
      During the study, one group will take a daily magnesium capsule for 12 weeks before switching
      to a placebo for 12 weeks. The other group will have the placebo intervention before
      switching to magnesium. Participants will be randomized into one of the two groups and will
      remain blinded until their participation in the study ends. The research team will also be
      unaware of each participant's current intervention however, this information will be
      available in case of medical emergency.

      Participants will be asked to attend one screening visit and three study visits. During these
      visits, a blood sample will be taken and you will be asked to complete questionnaires about
      you physical fitness and quality of life. You will also be asked to wear a Holter monitor for
      48 hours in order to count the number of PVCs and PACs you have daily. In addition to these
      assessments, you will also complete an exercise stress test during your screening visit.
