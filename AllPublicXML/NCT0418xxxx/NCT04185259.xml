  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) predominantly affects elderly and middle-aged individuals and is more
      frequent in runners or those whose employment requires standing. The available treatment
      options of PF mainly included non-operative treatments (e.g., plantar fascia and
      gastrocnemiussoleus muscle stretching, heel cups, arch supports, night splints, nonsteroidal
      antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local corticosteroid injections) and operative management.
      However, no consensus has been reached regarding the most beneficial treatment method for PF.

      Acupuncture has been used in the management of PF and the other musculoskeletal pain-related
      conditions for thousands of years. Recent two systematic reviews have found that acupuncture
      may reduce pain intensity and improve plantar function for patients with PF. However, there
      are methodological problems with small sample size, or not controlled with a placebo/waitlist
      group, or not account for the confounding effects of patients who experienced combination
      treatments in the design of the included acupuncture literature. Therefore, the placebo
      effect of acupuncture and a possible spontaneous remission for PF cannot be excluded and the
      beneficial effects of acupuncture for PF remained need to more assessment.

      The investigators designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      Traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA), compared with sham acupuncture (SA) or being on a
      waitlist control group (no acupuncture treatment), for patients with chronic PF for ≥ 6
      months. The hypothesis was that combined acupuncture and sham acupuncture will result in
      larger improvements in heel pain more than no acupuncture treatment in patients with chronic
      PF. Secondary hypotheses examined whether acupuncture reduce heel pain intensity more
      effectively than sham acupuncture or no acupuncture.

    <description>The investigators will apply two Ashi points (the two most severe tender points in the most sensitive area over the anteromedial aspect of the heels), Chengshan (BL57), Taixi (KI3) and Kunlun (BL60) in this trial. With the patient in a prone position, the local skin will be routinely sterilized followed by a 10mm diameter and 5mm thick sterile adhesive pad pasting onto each selected acupoint. Ashi points will be perpendicularly inserted through the pad to the plantar fascia layer with a depth of approximately 15-20mm depending on the location. BL57, KI3 and BL60 will be punched perpendicularly 10-15mm deep into the skin through the pad. All needles except Ashi points will be manually stimulated by small, equal manipulations of lifting, thrusting, twirling and rotating to achieve De qi. Needles will be retained for 30 minutes per treatment. During each treatment, every needle will be manipulated three times every 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>Sham Ashi (0.5 cun away from Ashi, one 'cun' is equivalent to the greatest width of the individual patients' thumb, ~1.5 cm), sham BL57 (0.5 cun lateral to true BL57 horizontally), sham KI3 (midway between true KI3 and heel tendon) and sham BL60 (midway between true BL60 and heel tendon) will be used. Treatment protocol will be similar to that of the acupuncture group. The Hwato-brand disposable blunt-tipped needles (size 0.30 × 25 mm) will be inserted at sham points through adhesive pads to the skin without skin penetration. The needles will then be lifted, thrusted, twirled, and rotated evenly three times every ten minutes. No specific de qi response will be elicited.</description>
