  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Devices pass through different development and study phases. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and,
      resulting from the pre-validation studies, they get optimized. Prior to product launch, the
      Phonak Hearing Systems get reviewed by a final quality control in terms of clinical trials.
      This is a validation study, investigating improved algorithms, features, functions and
      wearing comfort. This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric
      at Sonova AG Headquarters based in St채fa (Switzerland).

    <textblock>
      This study will compare two settings of an external microphone under real life conditions
      with experienced hearing aid users.

      The external microphone streams the signal (e.g. speaker) directly into the hearing
      instrument (HI).

      The subject should rate the devices in the lab and after a hometrial. The comfort, regarding
      to the loudness and the sound quality will be tested with the two settings at home and in the
      lab. Also the speech intelligibility will be tested in the lab.

      This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG
      Headquarters based in St채fa (Switzerland).
