  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a kind of G protein coupled receptor which
      regulate the insulin secretion and serves as potential target in the diagnosis of functional
      pancreas neuroendocrine tumor. The aim of this study was the clinical evaluation of a
      potential GLP-1R targeted tracer 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 for the detection of
      insulinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since GLP-1R is expressed in human β-cells and highly overexpressed in insulinomas，multiple
      GLP-1R-targeted radiopharmaceuticals were devoted to insulinoma localization
      imaging.68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 is an optimal probe targeting GLP-1R. A single dose of
      111-185 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 will be injected intravenously.
      Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.The investigators
      will determine the use of 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 PET/CT in the detection of
      insulinomas, and to compare its diagnostic value with conventional imaging.
