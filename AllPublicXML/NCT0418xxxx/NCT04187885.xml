  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is characterized by major transitions in sleep and circadian rhythm. This rapid
      pivotal period increases the risks of sleep debt and poor sleep quality, leading to
      pronounced diurnal fatigue and drowsiness. On the other hand, academic stress has been also
      associated with increased sleep disturbances.

      Both academic stress and poor sleep in adolescents has been linked to increased sleepiness
      rate, reduced alertness, lower academic performances and the impairment of the control of
      energy balance through hyperphagia.

      Despite the importance of sleep in holistic development, physical (i.e. recovery, metabolism,
      muscle growth, weight control), cognitive (i.e. learning, memory, decision-making,
      Vigilance). Few studies have been designed to improve this behavior among college
      adolescents, especially in times of academic stress.

      Physical activity has been suggested as a non-pharmacological alternative treatment for sleep
      disorders . Generally, it is well established that the duration and quality of sleep were
      improved by regular physical activity among adolescents and far better, it was suggested that
      the exercise-mediated effect on sleep could be even observed in the short term. Moreover, it
      was suggested that aerobic exercise has positive effects on psychological stress and
      well-being of adolescents .

      Therefore, APADOSLEEP trial, was designed to examine the effect of physical activity program
      on sleep during and outside periods of academic stress.

      Counterbalanced, cross-over, pre-post trial where each subject acts as his own control.

      Four sessions will be performed for each adolescent. Each session will be conducted over 5
      days (from Monday to Friday):

      Adolescents will take part randomly in four sessions. Physical activity program will be
      identical between sessions and groups. 60 minn of moderate to vigorous leisure activities and
      exercises will be proposed each day. Heart rate monitor will be used to control intensity of
      exercise during the physical activity program.

        -  Control session (CTL) outside academic stress period (represented by exams) and without
           the physical activity program.

        -  A session outside academic stress period, with the physical activity program (PAP).

        -  A session during an academic stress period without the physical activity program (AS).

        -  A session during an academic stress period with the physical activity program (ASPAP).

      At each session:

        -  Continuous sleep assessments (duration and quality) by accelerometry

        -  Continuous physical activity and sedentary behaviour assessments by accelerometry

        -  one evaluation of melatonin peak from salivary specimens

        -  one evaluation of cortisol peak from salivary specimens

        -  An evaluation of the ad libitum food intake of the 5th day will be carried out by the
           weighing method.

        -  one assessment of cognitive performance

        -  An evaluation of subjective appetite sensations (hunger, fullness, desire to eat) of the
           5th day

        -  An evaluation of subjective diurnal sleepiness (Karolinska) of the 5th day

Appetite sensations will be collected throughout the day using visual analogue scales (150 mm scales). Adolescents will report their hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective food consumption at thirteen regulated times: upon awakening, before and right after the breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner as well as bed time. The questions were i) &quot;How hungry do you feel?&quot;, ii) &quot;How full do you feel?&quot;, iii) &quot;Would you like to eat something?&quot;, iv) &quot;How much do you think you can eat?&quot; (adolescents were asked to respond on a scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;a lot&quot;). This method has been previously validated</description>
