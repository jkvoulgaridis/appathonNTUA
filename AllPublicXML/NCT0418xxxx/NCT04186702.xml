  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal ranibizumab injection procedure is simple and effective. In management of
      chronic DME there is no clear anatomical endpoint. Visual stability is the primary aim. Argon
      focal laser therapy can be the safe second choice. The combined therapy is successful and
      practical for chronic DME patients.

      Settings and Design: Randomized clinical study

      Subjects and Methods:

      investigators randomly assigned 150 adults (the average age was 59.32 years Â±2.79) with
      chronic diabetic macular edema involving the macular center for repeated ranibizumab
      injections (group A-75) or focal/direct argon laser after repeated ranibizumab injections
      (group B-75). The outcomes were the changes in visual acuity letter score and the central
      subfield thickness (CST) from baseline to one year. visual-acuity Letter score, and CST were
      analyzed with independent t-test and Mann Whitney-test. General linear model with
      multivariate analysis was used for visual acuity letter score, and CST in both groups.
