    <textblock>
      The current study was a pilot study examining a novel treatment for weight loss and emotional
      eating. The intervention is a group-based approach, and it includes a focus on teaching
      emotion regulation skills from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and traditional behavioral
      weight loss techniques. The goal of the study was to develop and refine the treatment
      protocol. Additional goals of the study were to evaluate feasibility and acceptability, to
      see whether the intervention could be administered and whether participants like the
      treatment and believe it helps them. Changes in weight and emotional eating from baseline to
      post-treatment will also be measured.

      Background: The current study was a preliminary investigation of Live FREE, a pilot study of
      a treatment that included a combination of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and
      Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL) techniques for overweight/obese adult emotional eaters. Live
      FREE was based on the premise that impaired emotion regulation skills promote emotional
      eating behavior and lead to weight gain. Consistent with the ORBIT model (Czajkowski et al.,
      2015) of behavioral treatment development, the primary study aim was to refine the treatment
      protocol.

      Methods: Adults with overweight/obesity who self-identified as emotional eaters were enrolled
      in Live FREE. Participants completed assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and at a
      6-month follow-up. The intervention delivered 10-weeks of emotion regulation skills training
      followed by 6-weeks of BWL treatment in a group-based format. Groups were co-led by a
      licensed clinical psychologist and a doctoral student. Feasibility and acceptability will be
      examined by calculating rate of enrollment into the study and session attendance. ANOVA will
      be used to examine changes in primary and secondary outcome variables (weight, emotional
      eating) over time. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) will be calculated to examine the magnitude of
      change observed in these outcomes using standard interpretation guidelines ( d=0.2 be
      considered a 'small' effect size, 0.5 represents a 'medium' effect size and 0.8 a 'large'
      effect size).

    <description>Self-reported frequency of emotional eating is measured with the 25-item Emotional Eating Scale. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (no desire to eat) to 5 (overwhelming desire to eat). Total scores range from 25-125. Higher scores indicate more emotional eating.The Emotional Eating Scale yields 3 subscales: depression, anxiety/anger, and boredom.</description>

    <description>Self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation is measured with the 36-item Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Ten items are reverse scored. Higher scores indicate more problems with emotion regulation. Total scores range from 36-180.</description>

    <description>The 38-item DBT skills subscale (DBT-WCCL-DSS) of the DBT Ways of Coping Checklist (DBT-WCCL) [37] is a self-report measure that assess DBT skills use. Items are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (never used) to 3 (regularly used). Higher scores indicate more frequent use of DBT skills. Total scores range from 0 - 114.</description>
