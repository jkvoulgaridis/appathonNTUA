  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous tracheostomy is the mouth opening of the tracheal ostium to the skin by creating
      an opening in the anterior wall of the trachea using Seldinger methods. This procedure is
      done using an endotracheal tube (ETT) or a laryngeal mask (LMA). High-frequency jet
      ventilation (HFJV) commonly used in oropharyngeal surgeries and creates an extra passage for
      the procedure. The investigators aimed to demonstrate the effective use of HFJV in
      percutaneous tracheostomy.

      Thirty patients between 18-80 years of age who were hospitalized in intensive care unit were
      included in the study. Patients whose written consent cannot be obtained and who undergo
      surgical tracheostomy for any reason will be excluded from the study. In addition, patients
      with active infection in the area of the procedure, bleeding diathesis and pathologies that
      interfere with the procedure in the ultrasonographic evaluation (thyroid diseases, etc.) will
      be excluded from the study. Patients will be divided into three groups as those using
      classical ventilation (group 1), HFJV (group 2) and classical laryngeal mask (group 3). Age,
      gender, height, BMI, ASA scores, presence and type of additional diseases, tracheostomy day,
      pre- and post-procedure blood gas analysis, duration of procedure, duration of anesthesia,
      complications during the procedure (bleeding , desaturation, accidental extubation,
      malposition, bradycardia, hypotension, etc.) will be recorded. Patients will be observed for
      mortality in the first 30 days after the procedure. Mortality results will be recorded.
