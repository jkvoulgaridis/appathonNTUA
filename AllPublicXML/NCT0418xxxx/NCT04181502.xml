    <textblock>
      During hepatic transection, it exists a high risk of perioperative blood loss. The
      haemorrhage and its consequences (hypovolemia and blood transfusion) might impact the short
      and long term morbidity The vascular control by hepatic pedicle clamping (Pringle's maneuver)
      or total hepatic vascular exclusion, helps minimizing blood loss and leads to a more
      extensive hepatic resection.

      Side effects of vascular control result of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) : these
      reperfusion lesions results of different mechanisms than those responsible for the ischemic
      one. IRI cause lesions and postoperative dysfunction of the remaining liver.

      Among strategies to reduce the adverse effects of IRI : ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) has
      been described. It can be either mechanical (intermittent hepatic pedicle clamping) or
      pharmacological (sevoflurane inhalation).

      Short intermittent vascular occlusions in a organ might produce a resistance to a longer
      ischaemic period. It is certainly a physiological organ adaptation to tissue hypoxemia, which
      has a therapeutic potential when targeted.

      During liver resection, ischaemic preconditioning is realised with periods of hepatic pedicle
      clamping and unclamping. It decrease morbidity and mortality and prevent postoperative
      hepatocellular insufficiency due to clamping and IRI at day 5.

      Ischaemic preconditioning may also be applied remotely. Indeed, it is shown that short
      ischaemic periods in a target organ can also have a protective effect on distant others. This
      mechanism involve three signalling pathways : neuronal , humoral and systemic pathways.

      In a previous randomized study, Kanoria and al, demonstrated that the remote ischaemic
      preconditioning group has shown significant lower rates of serum transaminases and higher
      liver clearance (spectrophotometry method) than the control group.

      A latest study, measuring postoperative prothrombin rates has shown improved liver recovery
      due to halogen agents such as sevoflurane.
