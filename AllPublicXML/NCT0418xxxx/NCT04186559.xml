  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beh√ßet's Disease (BD) is a complex, chronic, relapsing, multi-system inflammatory disorder
      that is characterized by oral ulcers, genital ulcers in addition to ocular and skin symptoms.
      Genital ulcers are the second most common symptom of BD and occur in 57-93% of BD patients.
      The genital ulcers of BD clearly cause considerable morbidity for those affected. This will
      be one of the first trials of a topical product designed for accelerated healing of BD
      genital ulcers. There is no cure or FDA-approved therapies for BD genital ulcers and the
      treatment of recurrent genital ulcers that are associated with BD is palliative.

      Recent study evaluating the effect of topical PTX on BD oral ulcers suggests that topical
      pentoxifylline (PTX) might have an immediate impact on BD oral ulcer healing leading to
      accelerated ulcer clearance, which results in lower daily ulcer numbers for the patients
      along with reduced pain scores. Investigators hypothesize that application of topical PTX
      will accelerate the healing of BD genital ulcers in a similar clinically meaningful way, and
      further hypothesize that topical PTX can become a valuable adjunct to any other systemic
      therapy for BD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In contrast to the recent study on BD oral ulcers, in which very carefully selected patients
      were enrolled (i.e. no immunosuppressive therapies and a new lesion of no more than 48hrs),
      this trial will be more &quot;Real World&quot; and enroll all patients with genital ulcers of BD,
      allowing randomization to eliminate biases between treatment and control groups. The
      advantages of this more open approach are twofold. First, this approach more directly
      measures the benefit of PTX gel therapy on the population that is more likely to use the
      therapy if it becomes approved. Secondly, those broader criteria will allow faster enrollment
      for a disease manifestation that occurs considerably less frequently than oral ulcers.

      This randomized proof of concept trial investigating the effect of topical PTX on BD genital
      ulcers will be double-blind, placebo controlled with a crossover component, and it will
      follow the patients during the treatment period of 30 days or until the healing of genital
      ulcers. Specifically, patients who receive placebo as their initial course of treatment would
      receive active drug in a second course of treatment in which they would be re-enrolled upon
      recurrence of another crop of genital ulcers. Conversely, patients who receive active drug in
      their initial course of treatment would receive placebo drug once they are re-enrolled for
      the second course of treatment.

      For all patients in either group, investigators will collect photographs of the external
      genital ulcer area, the size and location of the genital ulcers, number of ulcers, pain
      scores, and concomitant medications. This data will be collected for the following month or
      until the healing of genital ulcers. Additionally, adverse event experiences will be
      solicited. Data analyses will be exploratory comparisons of differences in safety and
      efficacy endpoints between BD patients who did and did not receive topical PTX.

    <description>The size of the genital ulcers will be measured at study enrollment and during the 30-day treatment period or until the healing of the genital ulcer(s). The change in the size of the genital ulcers will be compared between two study arms. Genital ulcer size will be calculated by measuring the ulcer area via the image processing of ulcer photographs. Time to healing will be calculated as the number of days to reach genital ulcer area of zero. Shorter time to ulcer area of zero(complete healing of genital ulcers) would be a better outcome. Accordingly, longer time to genital ulcer area of zero would be a worse outcome.</description>

The change in the total number of genital ulcers will be compared between two study arms. Upon complete healing of genital ulcers, ulcer number of zero would be expected (better outcome). Accordingly, if genital ulcers are not healed, there would be greater total number of genital ulcers (worse outcome).</description>

    <description>Pain scores will be compared between two study arms as measuring pain offers an opportunity to correlate simple measurements of genital ulcers with patient's fundamental disease experience. Pain scores will be evaluated by using the numeric rating scale with the range of 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain).</description>
