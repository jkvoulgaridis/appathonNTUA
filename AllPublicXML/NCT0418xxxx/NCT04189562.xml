  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of the text messaging (SMS-based) disease management
      intervention for children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using the
      timeliness of stimulant prescription renewals over a 9-month period.

      Parents of participants in the study will receive customized text messages once a day, Sunday
      through Friday, for a duration of 9 months. The text messages will include reminders to
      adhere to the individualized medication regimen, reminders to call their child's clinician
      for a prescription refill followed by reminders to pick up medication from the pharmacy, and
      educational reminders about ADHD and its treatment.
