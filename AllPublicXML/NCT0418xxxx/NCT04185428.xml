    <textblock>
      This pilot study will use a mixed methods approach to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of Integrative Therapies, a bedside service offering mindfulness-based
      interventions (still meditation, meditative movement, relaxation techniques, and massage
      therapy) as non-pharmacologic treatment for symptom management in newly diagnosed adult Acute
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients undergoing induction chemotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UF Health Integrative Therapies inpatient program offers mindfulness-based interventions
      consisting of still meditation, meditative movement, relaxation techniques, and massage
      therapy to patients at the bedside. This mixed methods feasibility pilot aims to move toward
      optimal use of the Integrative Therapies service amongst AML patients undergoing induction
      chemotherapy by: 1) examining the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention and
      describing the distribution of variables, 2) developing a greater understanding of patient
      experience, and 3) exploring facilitators and barriers to engagement with the service. The
      investigators intend to use the data collected from this study to inform a subsequent
      multi-site study with a larger sample size and adjustments depending on the results from this
      investigation.

      The study team will also explore the acceptability to participation in Integrative Therapies
      bedside service by conducting a qualitative, phenomenological thematic analysis of patient
      interviews. The intent of a convergent design is to merge the analyses of the quantitative
      and qualitative data that are gathered during the implementation of Integrative Therapies
      bedside service.

    <description>For the intervention group, an initial interview will be conducted and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) questionnaires will be administered at enrollment. Integrative Therapies will then begin offering two to four sessions weekly. At 7, 14, and 21 days (+-2 days) after the start of induction chemotherapy, the PROMIS and the MSAS questionnaires will be administered again along with an acceptability questionnaire. At 21 (+-2) days after the start of induction chemotherapy, a second interview will be conducted.</description>
