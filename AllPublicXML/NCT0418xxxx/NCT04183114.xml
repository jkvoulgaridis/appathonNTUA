      The objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the protectivity rate of Bio Farma's Measles/Rubella (MR) vaccine in infants

        -  To describe antibody response to Measles and Rubella after 1 dose of Bio Farma's MR
           vaccine as a primary dose in infants

        -  To assess the safety of Bio Farma's Measles/Rubella (MR) vaccine in infants

        -  To evaluate immunogenicity and safety one dose of Bio Farma's MR vaccine compare to
           registered MR vaccine.

        -  To evaluate immunogenicity and safety in three consecutive batches of Bio Farma's MR
           vaccine in infants .
