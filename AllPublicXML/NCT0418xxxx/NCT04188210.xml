      The study will include the patients undergoing hemodialysis. The patients with surgery at
      upper extremity in last 3 months, the presence of conditions such as cancer, chronic hearing
      loss and neurologic diseases affect the interview will be excluded. Sociodemographic
      properties which include age, gender, duration of dialysis, educational level, comorbid
      diseases, vascular access area, hand dominancy will be asked. The Beck Depression Inventory
      (BDI), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand
      Score (Q-DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will applied to all patients.

      All the demographic results and vascular access area for hemodialysis will be detected. All
      data for normality will be tested by using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To compare the
      differences between groups, Mann Whitney U test will be used

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) scores were measured for all patients to evaluate depression symptoms and health-related quality of life. The elbow pain presence was asked to all the patients, the patients with elbow pain were also evaluated with The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score (Q-DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). VAS detected as pain during rest, activity, night and pain at last week.</description>
