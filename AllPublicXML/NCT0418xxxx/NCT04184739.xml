      Mobile phones are potentially an invaluable tool in improving adherence, they are readily
      available and can utilised to deliver several approaches to improve adherence simultaneously.
      A personalised App to help support orthodontic patients ('My Braces') was therefore developed
      by the researchers. The App provides generic treatment information and also has a
      personalised element. The personalised element allows patients to input their own treatment
      information (including progress photographs), set goals, develop plans for achieving these
      and it provides the patient and clinicians with appropriate dashboards to monitor progress.

      This research will be conducted at the Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH Foundation Trust,
      London. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of the My Braces App, an App designed to
      support patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment.

      Effectiveness of the My Braces App will be tested by way of a randomised controlled trial.
      Participants will be allocated to one of three groups:

      Group A: Standard treatment information (verbal and written) and access to a basic version of
      the My Braces App with a toothbrushing timer. The timer is necessary as the health behaviour
      outcome is toothbrushing duration.

      Group B: As for group A, however, additionally the My Braces App will provide generic
      treatment information (a combination of videos and text)

      Group C: As for group B, however, the patients will have access to the full functionality of
      the My Braces App and the App will allow patients to input their own personalised treatment
      information (including progress photographs), set goals, develop plans for achieving these
      and provide the patient and clinicians with appropriate dashboards to monitor progress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Child Dental Health Survey (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) indicated that
      9% of 12 years olds are receiving orthodontic treatment (the use of braces to straighten
      teeth) and a further 37% have an unmet need. Treatment duration is lengthy (2-3 years on
      average) and adherence to treatment advice is essential for successful outcomes. It has been
      reported that up to 43% of patients fail to complete treatment and there are currently no
      useful predictors of non-completion. The NHS England annual spend on primary care
      orthodontics is in excess of Â£200 million, non-completion of treatment therefore represents a
      significant inefficient use of public resources.

      Mobile phones are potentially an invaluable tool in improving adherence, they are readily
      available and can utilised to deliver several approaches to improve adherence simultaneously.
      A personalised App to help support orthodontic patients ('My Braces') was therefore developed
      by the researchers. The App provides generic treatment information and also has a
      personalised element. The personalised element allows patients to input their own treatment
      information (including progress photographs), set goals, develop plans for achieving these
      and it provides the patient and clinicians with appropriate dashboards to monitor progress.

      This research will be conducted at the Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH Foundation Trust,
      London. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of the My Braces App, an App designed to
      support patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment.

      Effectiveness of the My Braces App will be tested by way of a randomised controlled trial.
      Participants will be allocated to one of three groups:

      Group A: Standard treatment information (verbal and written) and access to a basic version of
      the My Braces App with a toothbrushing timer. The timer is necessary as the health behaviour
      outcome is toothbrushing duration.

      Group B: As for group A, however, additionally the My Braces App will provide generic
      treatment information (a combination of videos and text)

      Group C: As for group B, however, the patients will have access to the full functionality of

      information (including progress photographs), set goals, develop plans for achieving these
      and provide the patient and clinicians with appropriate dashboards to monitor progress.

      It is important to include Group B as this will allow the team to ascertain whether it is the
      personalisation of the App content which infers any benefit over and above providing generic
      information via an App if a difference is found between Groups A and C.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients accepted for orthodontic treatment utilising fixed orthodontic braces ('train
             track' braces) at the Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH Foundation Trust (UCLH EDH)

          -  10-18 years (inclusive) at the start of treatment

          -  Familiarity with, and daily access to, a smartphone/tablet â¢ Ability to read and
             communicate in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Craniofacial/Orthognathic patients or those with severe hypodontia (developmental
             absence of teeth); these patients require complex multi-disciplinary treatment. The
             information need for these patients is therefore different to routine orthodontic
             treatment

          -  Communication difficulties (for example, severe autism, learning difficulties)

          -  Patients who are aware that a family member/friend is enrolled in the study (including
             a preceding feasibility study, the pilot or RCT) - this is to avoid the patient
             potentially having access to parts of the App relating to groups other than that the
             patient is allocated to
