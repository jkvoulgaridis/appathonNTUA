    <measure>Figure-of-Eight Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Figure-of-Eight Walk Test involves straight and curved paths in order to assess the advanced walking performance required in daily life.The subject walks a &quot;figure 8&quot; pattern around two cones spaced 5 ft apart, and the time and number of steps needed to complete the assessment are recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a widely used measure of impairment and disability associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD) consisting of four sections: (1) Mentation, behavior, and mood; (2) Activities of daily living (ADLs); (3) Motor; and (4) Complications.Sections I through III are scored using a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = no impairment; 4 = marked impairment). Although individual sections are scored and reported independently, scores from sections I through III are also summed to provide a UPDRS Total score. The UPDRS total score ranges between 0 and 199 points. Higher points indicates worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hoehn and Yahr Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Disease stage is assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr Scale. The Hoehn and Yahr scale is a commonly used diagnostic tool for quantifying the progression of Parkinson's Disease symptoms. Stages range from 0 (no signs of disease) to 5 (requiring a wheelchair, or bedridden unless assisted).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Functional mobility is assessed by using the timed up and go test. The timed up and go test measures the time that a patient needs to stand up from a chair, walk a 3-m distance, come back and sit back on the chair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a scale that using for assess postural stability. It ranges 0-56 with higher score indicates better stability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>10 Meter Walk Test measures the time required to complete straight walk of 10 meters distance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC), to quantify the level of confidence in performing a specific task without losing balance or becoming unsteady.The ABC scale is a self-reported questionnaire providing information on balance confidence in the performance of 16 different daily activities, such as stair climbing, walking in the house, and walking on slippery floors. The questionnaire contains 16 items scored on a range from 0% to 100% (0 indicating no confidence and 100 indicating full confidence).</description>
