  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled open-label add-on design trial pilot study to
      evaluate the efficacy of personalized adjunctive antibiotic (azithromycin + metronidazole)
      therapy in pediatric subjects with mild to moderate Crohn's disease (CD) who have a
      microbiome profile associated with increased risk of early relapse. This an add-on design
      trial for subjects already receiving standard of care therapy to induce remission; there will
      be no placebos.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that adjunctive antibiotic therapy will improve clinical response to
      standard of care (SOC) induction therapy in a subgroup of CD patients with a
      relapse-associated microbiome profile.

      Prior to starting SOC induction therapy at week 0, subjects will provide a baseline stool
      sample that will be screened for microbiome profiles associated with risk of relapse
      according to an established statistical model.

      At week 4, subjects with a relapse-associated microbiome will be randomized into either a
      control arm that will continue to receive SOC induction therapy for an additional 8 weeks, or
      a treatment arm that will receive adjunctive antibiotic therapy in addition to continuing to
      receive SOC induction therapy for an additional 8 weeks. Subjects who do not have a
      relapse-associated microbiome will enter a separate control arm that will continue to receive
      SOC induction therapy and will have data collected for exploratory objectives. Subjects who
      are not in clinical remission by week 4 will receive antibiotic therapy regardless of
      microbiome signature at baseline. Subjects will be monitored for an additional 40 weeks after
      the treatment period (52 weeks total).

    <description>Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) is an index used to measure disease activity of pediatric patients with Crohn's Disease assessing abdominal pain, stool frequency, patient functioning, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, weight, height, examination of abdomen, perirectal disease, and extraintestinal manifestations. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.</description>

    <description>The IMPACT III questionnaire is a 35-item assessment of health-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease [CD] or ulcerative colitis). In this study, subjects aged 9 and older will complete this questionnaire at week 0, 12, 24, and 52. Subjects mark an option from 1 to 5 for each item.The total scores range from 35 to 175, with higher scores representing a better quality of life.</description>
