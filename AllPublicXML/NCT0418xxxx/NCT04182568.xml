      This study is an open, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial for patients with
      newly diagnosed primary invasive breast cancer and clinical stage of T2 or above. The main
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dose-dense nab-paclitaxel compared with
      dose-dense docetaxel followed by anthracycline and cyclophosphamide in the treatment of HR
      positive and HER-2 negative breast cancer. The effectiveness and safety of the treatment.
