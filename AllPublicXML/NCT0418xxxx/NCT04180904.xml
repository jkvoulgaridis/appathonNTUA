      The purpose of this study is to learn whether changing diet impacts psoriatic arthritis
      (PsA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study asks if dietary change and nutritional support improves disease activity and if
      patients are better able to improve or sustain progress with additional incentives. The study
      will use an online program to communicate with participants through text and online surveys.
      This 24-week trial will enroll 90 patients in the US and Canada with New York University as a
      back-up site.

    <intervention_model_description>In this randomized controlled pilot trial, we will test different diets to determine the impact on disease outcomes among patients with psoriatic arthritis. This is a 24-week trial that will enroll 90 patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite stable therapy among three sites in the US and Canada. Dietary interventions will be enhanced with gamification, including feedback and competition. Biomarker samples including blood, urine and stool specimens will be collected and banked for exploratory analyses.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In a study assessing dietary behavioral interventions, absolute blinding of the participants is not possible because of obvious differences between intervention diets. However, we will avoid naming the allocated dietary intervention and withhold information about our research hypothesis from the patients. Participants in the control group will receive the same schedule of visits and patient reported outcomes. The study rheumatologists (outcome assessors) will be blinded to the allocated group and the participants will be asked to avoid discussing the details of their diet with them.</masking_description>

    <description>-Physical Function-International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) We will examine change in physical activity over the study (as we will be advising patients not to change exercise habits). IPAQ is an instrument for assessing levels and patterns of physical activity. IPAQ has been validated in healthy adults and is publicly available, open access, and no permissions are required for use.</description>

    <description>-Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Impact- Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PSAID). The PsAID is a measure developed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and is composed of domains selected by an international group of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The questionnaire uses a weighted scoring system (weights were derived by patient impression of importance) and has a range of 0-10 with 4 being considered a patient acceptable symptom state. The proposed Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is 3.</description>

    <description>-Skin Disease Impact- Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index used to express the severity of psoriasis. It combines the severity (erythema (redness), induration (thickness) and desquamation (peeling) and percentage of affected area. This is the primary outcome measure in trials of psoriatic arthritis.</description>

The instrument includes items on exhaustion and ability to function normally in physical, social, mental and family roles and activities. This instrument has good content validity and responsiveness in rheumatoid arthritis, a similar inflammatory arthritis. We will use the CAT (Computerized Adaptive Test) response instrument.</description>

The PROMIS depression scale is used across diseases but has been specifically demonstrated to have good responsiveness with therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The item bank assesses symptoms over the past 7 days. (Suicidality is not assessed in this questionnaire). We will use the CAT (Computerized Adaptive Test) response instrument.</description>
