  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to determine the feasibility and utility of using serial magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to assess treatment response during and after radiation therapy
      (standard of care cancer treatment) for participants with advanced esophageal cancer or
      glioblastoma.

      The research study procedures include three MRI scans (one pre treatment, during and post
      standard care cancer radiation therapy) for participants with advanced esophageal cancer or
      glioblastoma

      The research study procedures include:

        -  Screening for eligibility

        -  Three MRI scans

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1, non randomized open label study, evaluating feasibility of serial MRI, with an
      option for an expansion cohort. The optional expansion cohort is a prospective imaging
      registry evaluating imaging biomarkers as predictors of disease control with standard of care
      treatment.

      This research study is a feasibility study, which means it is the first-time investigators at
      this institution are examining the process of getting multiple MRIs during radiation
      treatment.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared this MRI scanner for use.

      Participants who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial.

        -  The research study procedures include:

        -  Screening for eligibility

        -  Three MRI scans (Imaging with MRI will be performed as per disease site standards.)

        -  A total of 86 participants will be enrolled in this trial

        -  Phase 1

             -  20 participants in Esophageal Cohort

             -  20 Participants in Glioblastoma Cohort

        -  Expansion Cohort --- 46 Participants in the Glioblastoma Expansion Cohort
