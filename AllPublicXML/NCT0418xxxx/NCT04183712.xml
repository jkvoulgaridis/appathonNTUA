  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of target
      therapy according to genomic and proteomic profiling combined with GEMOX in recectable
      gallbladder carcinoma patients monitored by ctDNA.

      Genomic profiling studies the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a tumor to detect genetic
      changes or abnormalities. immuno-histochemistry tests reveal the abnormal activation status
      of signal pathways involved in study. These information will be used to recommend target
      therapy which may be more likely to result in a beneficial response. Patients will receive
      target antitumor agents according to the result of genomic and proteomic profiling and be
      monitored by circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA).
