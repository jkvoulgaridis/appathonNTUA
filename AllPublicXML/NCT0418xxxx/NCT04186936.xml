  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess bioequivalence between a Combination caplet with
      loperamide hydrogen chloride (HCl) 2 milligram (mg) and simethicone 125 mg, and Imodium
      Express tablets-lyophilizate with loperamide HCl 2 mg (co-administered with Espumisan
      capsules with simethicone 40 mg), with respect to the single-dose pharmacokinetics of
      loperamide HCl. The maximum observed concentration (Cmax), and the area under the
      concentration-vs.-time curve until the last measurable concentration (AUC [0-t]) will be used
      to assess bioequivalence.
