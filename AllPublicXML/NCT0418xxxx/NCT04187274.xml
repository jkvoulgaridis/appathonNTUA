  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational substudy is to evaluate the feasibility, performance and
      behavior of the IKORUS (Advanced Perfusion Diagnostics, Villeurbanne, France), a new tissue
      perfusion device using urethral photoplethysmography in patients undergoing major abdominal
      surgery and in whom an advanced hemodynamic monitoring is placed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous monitoring of tissue perfusion in patients undergoing major surgery remains
      challenging because of the lack of tools available. Through using urethral
      photoplethysmography, the urethral perfusion index (uPI) could allow tissue perfusion
      monitoring through a modified urinary catheter. The goal of this observational study is to
      evaluate the feasibility , performance and behavior of the IKORUS (Advanced Perfusion
      Diagnostics, Villeurbanne, France), a new device in the field. We aimed to assess its
      performance (duration and signal quality), the uPI variations during hemodynamic events
      (fluid challenge -vasopressor infusion rates modifications, hypotension, hypertension, etc)
      in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and equipped with an advanced hemodynamic
      monitoring.
