  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We recently developed a new Neuro-immersion system based on virtual reality and 3D
      (dimension) motion tracking. This tool makes it possible to evaluate and record the spatial
      localization performance of sounds and to highlight localization deficits in the three
      dimensions of space in deaf patients. Unfortunately, there is currently no suitable support
      to compensate for these localization deficits. However, the discomfort felt by the patients
      is clearly verbalized.

      Thanks to the new virtual reality system, we are now able to develop a training protocol
      based on spatial sound localization tasks.

    <description>Explicit spatial auditory performances (&quot;2d-D&quot;) is the combined (head) pointing error, corresponding to the distance in the space between the exact position of the target and the pointing of the subject. In other words, the more precise the subject becomes in his location of a sound source and the lower the value of &quot;2d-D&quot;.
Implicit spatial auditory performances (called &quot;RT&quot;) is the response time between the participant's response and the light point.</description>

    <description>During Protocol 1 (visit 1), participants of Group A will perform auditory spatial localization tasks with sensory feedback and during Protocol 2 (visit 2), they will perform auditory tasks without any notion of spatial localization. The 2 visits will be spaced at least 2 weeks (Wash-out).
The effects of each of the protocols on spatial location hearing abilities will be specifically assessed by comparing the results of the different assessments (SPHERE and Visual Discrimination Test) obtained before and after each protocol.</description>
