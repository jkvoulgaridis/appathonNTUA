  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans and active
      duty military, the focus of this research study is to test the reliability of two new PTSD
      assessments, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the PTSD Symptom
      Scale Interview for DSM-5 (PSSI-5) and compare the results between the two new assessments
      and the previous &quot;gold standard&quot;, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS-IV).
      Biomarkers believed to be related to PTSD (e.g., biofluid biomarkers, cognitive and
      physiological markers, and neural activity as measured by EEG) will be collected to inform
      targeted interventions in specific groups of patients and other large-scale biomarker
      discovery efforts in the field. Participants will be 950 male and female active duty military
      and veterans ages 18 or older who have been exposed to at least one traumatic event.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observational study where participants will be randomized into one of
      the four study cohorts. The primary goals of this study are to establish the test-retest
      reliability of the CAPS-5 and the PSSI-5 and to compare these with each other (Cohorts 1 and
      2), to test the convergent validity of the CAPS-5 against the PSSI (Cohort 3) and against the
      CAPS-IV (Cohort 4), and finally to investigate the consistency of response over 12 weeks on
      CAPS-5 (Cohort 1) and on the PSSI-5 (Cohort 2). In addition, on an exploratory level,
      possible biomarkers of PTSD and their relationship to each other and to diagnosis of PTSD
      will be evaluated.

      Participants will be 950 males and females recruited from the Cincinnati VA Medical Center
      (Cincinnati, OH), Trauma Recovery Center, and Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, HI).

      the investigators anticipate that understanding the validity and reliability of the PSSI-5
      and the CAPS-5 and the biomarkers related to PTSD will provide necessary information for care
      provided to active duty military and veterans suffering from PTSD. It will also directly
      inform trial designs and increase the likelihood of technical and regulatory success for new
      treatments for PTSD.
