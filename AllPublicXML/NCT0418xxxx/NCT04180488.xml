  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab in study participants with CSU who remain
      symptomatic despite the use of H1 antihistamine (Study A: omalizumab naïve; Study B:
      omalizumab intolerant or incomplete responders)

      Secondary Objectives:

      To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on urticaria activity composite endpoint and itch or
      hives, separately, at various timepoints To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on
      angioedema To demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab on urticaria control To demonstrate
      improvement in health-related quality of life and overall disease status and severity To
      evaluate the ability of dupilumab in reducing the proportion of patients who require
      treatment with oral corticosteroids (OCS) To evaluate safety outcome measures To evaluate
      immunogenicity of dupilumab
