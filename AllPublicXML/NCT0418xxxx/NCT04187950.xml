  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the central hypothesis that adding to the diet daily yogurt with
      honey provides beneficial effects on digestive health and subjective mood in healthy adults.

      This clinical trial will be a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study with two
      2-week treatment conditions separated by at least a 4-week washout period between conditions.
      Participant flow through the study conditions will be counterbalanced. Participants will be
      randomly allocated to yogurt with honey first or control first. Before beginning the first
      intervention period, participants will undergo a 2-week lead-in period that is devoid of all
      supplemental and dietary probiotics, fermented dairy products, and fermented foods.
      Participants will be asked to refrain from consuming all supplemental and dietary probiotics,
      fermented dairy products, and fermented foods throughout the entire study.

    <measure>Intestinal transit time measured using colored dye markers</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on intestinal transit time in vivo compared to control, yogurt containing heat-inactivated B.lactis with added sugar. Intestinal transit time will be measured using colored dye markers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digestive health measured using daily stool records with the Bristol Stool Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on digestive health compared to control (yogurt containing heat-inactivated B. lactis) using daily stool records. Within the records, participants rate stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digestive health measured using rating scales of additional symptoms in daily stool records</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on other measures of digestive health compared to control (yogurt containing heat-inactivated B. lactis) using daily stool records. Within the records, ratings of additional gastrointestinal symptoms include ease of passage, abdominal pain, bloating, burping, flatulence, nausea, reflux, and rumblings.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digestive health measured using the Gastrointestinal Tolerability questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on other measures of digestive health compared to control (yogurt containing heat-inactivated B. lactis) using the Gastrointestinal Tolerability questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses gastrointestinal health through 6 questions related to gastrointestinal health including nausea, bloating, rumblings, gas/flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Each of the questions pertains to experience of symptoms in the past 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digestive health measured using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on other measures of digestive health compared to control (yogurt containing heat-inactivated B. lactis) using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire. The GIQLI assesses gastrointestinal health through a series of 36 questions pertaining to daily life and gastrointestinal symptoms experienced in the past 2 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood measured using the Emotional Image Task</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on mood states compared to control (yogurt containing heat-inactivated B. lactis) using the Emotional Image Task. This task measures response to neutral, positive, and negative image stimuli using electroencephalography.</description>

    <measure>Mood measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of consumption of daily yogurt with honey on mood states compared to control (yogurt containing heat-inactivated B. lactis) using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire. The PANAS assesses general mood using a 20-item scale that includes words associated with either positive (10 words) or negative (10 words) emotions.</description>
