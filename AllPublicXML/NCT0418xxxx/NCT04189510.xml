    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, single center, randomized controlled parallel group
      open-label trial. Participants with insulin requiring diabetes mellitus who have been offered
      an organ for living or deceased donor kidney transplantation will be recruited prior to
      transplantation surgery. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to AP (6 patients) and
      conventional treatment groups (3 patients). At the end of the subject's post-operative
      in-patient stay, participants will have the option of wearing a blinded CGM at home for 4
      weeks while treating themselves with multiple daily injections (MDI).

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a hypothesis-generating pilot study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of the closed loop control in kidney transplant recipients with history
      of insulin requiring diabetes mellitus in the early postoperative period.

      This study will be a prospective, single center, randomized controlled parallel group
      open-label trial. Participants with insulin requiring diabetes mellitus who have been offered
      an organ for living or deceased donor kidney transplantation will be recruited prior to
      transplantation surgery. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to AP (6 patients) and
      conventional treatment groups (3 patients). At the end of the subject's post-operative
      in-patient stay, participants will have the option of wearing a blinded CGM at home for 12
      weeks while treating themselves with multiple daily injections (MDI).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age â‰¥18.0 years old at time of consent

          2. History of insulin requiring diabetes mellitus, type 1 or type 2, who have end stage
             renal disease (ESRD)

          3. Expected to undergo deceased or living donor kidney transplant surgery

          4. History of insulin prescription (past or current use)

          5. If female and sexually active, must agree to use a form of contraception to prevent
             pregnancy while a participant in the study. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             will be required for all females of childbearing potential. Participants who become
             pregnant will be discontinued from the study.

          6. Willingness to switch to lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) if not using already,
             and to use no other insulin besides lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) during the
             study

          7. Total daily insulin dose (TDD) at least 10 U/day

          8. An understanding and willingness to follow the protocol and signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant during the trial

          2. Currently breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed

          3. A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere
             with the completion of the protocol.

          4. Having a family member(s) employed by Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. or having a direct
             supervisor at place of employment who is also directly involved in conducting the
             clinical trial (as a study investigator, coordinator, etc.); or having a first-degree
             relative who is directly involved in conducting the clinical trial.

          5. Patients who have consented to participate in other interventional trials will be
             excluded or given the opportunity to exit from the study
