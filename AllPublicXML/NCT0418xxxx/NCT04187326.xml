  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High trait anxiety, a stable personality trait, is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders.
      Individuals with high trait anxiety have difficulty differentiating safety from threat,
      including visual information like emotional faces. This study aims to characterize visual
      system function in high trait anxiety. A portion of this study involves an intervention. For
      the intervention portion, a subset of participants will be asked to return for a lab visit
      upon completing the first portion of the study (multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scan). During this follow up visit, participants will complete a computer task that involves
      looking at faces and identifying emotions. Participants will complete this task either six
      months or twelve months after their MRI scan visit. Results from this research have the
      potential to inform novel therapies that target the visual system in individuals at risk for
      the development of psychiatric disorders.

      The purpose of this study is to understand how people with anxious personalities process
      emotional facial expressions. The intervention portion of this study is part of a larger
      study. The first portion of this study consists of a screening visit with questionnaires, and
      a second visit with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and short computer tasks.

      For the intervention portion of this study, a subset of participants will return to the lab
      for an in-person visit either six or twelve months after their MRI scan. This visit will last
      approximately two hours. Participants will be asked to complete a computer task where they
      will be asked to identify emotional face expressions and receive feedback on their
      performance. They will also complete questionnaires about their mood and emotions.

      The primary purpose of this research is to gather scientific information about how people
      with anxiety process social and emotional information.

    <intervention_model_description>We will use a waitlist-control design. A subset of participants will return to complete visual training using the Micro Expression Training Tool (METT). Half of these participants will complete the task at their first follow up visit (approximately six months post scan), and half will complete the task at their second follow up visit (approximately twelve months post scan).
The METT presents videos of micro expressions; participants receive real-time feedback following forced choice emotional identification. The METT includes a brief pre-test, training, and then a post-test. We will collect performance accuracy data. This behavioral task will provide preliminary feasibility data for the development of interventions with visual system targets by helping us determine if the METT is tolerable in individuals with high trait anxiety.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The METT is a well-validated task designed to improve perception of subtle changes in facial expressions, termed microexpressions. Participants with high trait anxiety will return to the lab approximately six months post scan visit to complete this computer-based task. They will receive feedback during the task on their accuracy.</description>
