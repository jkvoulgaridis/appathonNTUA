  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, crossover study is to investigate the effects
      of Bang速 Keto Coffee on resting and post-exercise metabolism and muscular performance during
      lower body resistance exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance-trained males and females will be recruited for participation in a randomized,
      double-bind, crossover trial. After providing informed consent, each participant will undergo
      a familiarization session to become accustomed to the study procedures. Following
      familiarization, each participant will complete two laboratory visits consisting of
      metabolism and exercise performance assessments. In both visits, a baseline assessment of
      resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) will be conducted using
      indirect calorimetry. Following the initial RMR assessment, each participant will ingest a
      coffee flavored beverage, either VPX Bang速 Keto Coffee or a flavor-matched placebo. After
      beverage consumption, the participant will return to the supine position and rest prior to
      initiation of the second RMR assessment. Immediately following the second RMR assessment, the
      participant will begin a 5-minute dynamic bodyweight warm up. Participants will then begin
      squat testing procedures on a mechanized squat device. After completing the squat testing,
      participants will complete a standard 1-repetition maximum and repetitions to failure using a
      plate-loaded hip sled machine. Following the hip sled testing, participants will repeat the
      mechanized squat testing. Following completion of the exercise testing, a third and final RMR
      assessment will be performed. Following successful completion of the first condition, each
      participant will enter a wash out period, after which the visit will be repeated with
      ingestion of the alternative beverage.
