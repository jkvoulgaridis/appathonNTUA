  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to measure certain indicators of resiliency to better
      understand which participants who are over 60 years old will respond more positively to bone
      marrow transplant. This research is being done to determine if there are traits that make
      recipients more likely to bounce back following allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is the only potentially curative
      therapy for many forms of leukemia, lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies. As with
      many forms of cancer, many of the most common indications for alloBMT disproportionally
      affect older people. Although treatments have improved for older adults undergoing therapies
      for these diseases, the outcomes are variable and there is little biological knowledge to
      help identify specific factors that would predict why some people do well with treatment and
      others develop functional and cognitive decline and other adverse health outcomes.

      Data specific to patients older than 60 who have undergone alloBMT are sparse even though the
      1 year non-relapse mortality rate in patients older than age 50 at Johns Hopkins is 12%. In
      none of these studies have geriatric assessment measures in domains such as cognition and
      function been evaluated. Given the low incidence of non-relapse mortality in the
      investigators' older patients, the investigators have a unique opportunity to study the
      factors that influence not only mortality but function after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. The investigators aim to be able to counsel patients more specifically about
      likely outcomes after transplant.
