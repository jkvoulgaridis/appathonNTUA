  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare liver disease that damages the liver's bile
      ducts. Bile ducts are tiny tubes that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. Bile
      is a liquid produced by the liver that helps us absorb and use the nutrients in the food we
      eat. In people with PSC, the bile backs up into the liver and will damage it, causing
      scarring of the liver.

      The purposes of this study are to:

        -  Collect medical and other data to learn more about PSC, how it progresses, and identify
           factors that may cause the disease to progress more quickly.

        -  Ask questions about how PSC symptoms affect your child's life to learn more about its
           impact on your child's daily functioning

        -  Children with PSC who are seen at one of the participating clinical sites in the
           Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) will be asked to contribute
           information, DNA, and other specimens. The information and specimens will be available
           to investigators to carry out approved research aimed at learning more about the
           possible causes and long-term effects of PSC.

    <textblock>
      Pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare autoimmune biliary fibrosing disease
      that leads to significant morbidity, the need for liver transplantation in ~50% of patients,
      and an increased risk for biliary and colorectal cancers in adulthood. The progression of the
      biliary disease in children is variable and risk factors associated with a more rapid
      progression of disease have not been adequately studied. Importantly, pediatric hepatologists
      have never previously collaborated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) specialists to
      rigorously explore interactions between colonic inflammation and liver disease. New
      non-invasive imaging modalities to measure fibrosis have not been explored in pediatric PSC.
      Furthermore, the impact that PSC has on the global functioning of children is not well
      understood, and likely underappreciated.

      The natural history of pediatric PSC is poorly understood. This study aims to determine risk
      factors, including activity of co-existent IBD, associated with more rapid progression of
      disease, characterize the impact of PSC on global functioning, define the spectrum and
      prognostic value of biliary tract disease and liver fibrosis based on novel imaging
      techniques, and establish a biobank of specimens for future mechanistic studies aimed at
      discovering biomarkers pertaining to etiology and severity of PSC and novel mechanisms of
      immunopathogenesis of disease. This comprehensive observational and longitudinal study will
      delineate unique aspects of the natural history and severity of pediatric PSC and of
      associated IBD and provide necessary data for future therapeutic trials. It aims to provide a
      platform to discover and validate circulating and imaging biomarkers, which may serve as
      surrogate endpoints in future interventional studies.

    <measure>To characterize the major phenotypes of PSC including patients with large duct or small duct disease, with and without Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), and with and without Auto Immune Hepatitis (AIH)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be collected on all phenotypes of PSC but attention is focused on how the intestinal inflammation and clinical activity of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affect the progression of PSC, better classification of patients with features of Auto Immune Hepatitis (AIH), and the implications of bacterial cholangitis amongst all PSC phenotypes.
Collection of retrospective clinical and laboratory data from the time of diagnosis of PSC and annual timepoints thereafter. Information regarding clinically important timepoints, laboratory data and FibroScan Liver Stiffness Measurements (LSM) are collected prospectively.
Slides/images (if available) from each liver biopsy obtained at the time of diagnosis of PSC and thereafter and from the explanted liver recovered at the time of liver transplantation will undergo central review.
Cholangiography results (MRCP, ERCP) will also undergo central review.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To identify the symptoms of PSC in children and the affects of those symptoms on the functional health of children.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Identify deficits in the functional health of children with PSC and explore the association of these functional parameters with biochemical markers of liver disease severity and IBD activity. Symptoms and the impact the symptoms on the functional health of children is measured through the use of &quot;Patient Reported Outcomes&quot; and performance-based metrics.
The burden of disease on the quality of life for children with PSC is measured utilizing the Peds-QL questionnaires (parent proxy and self-report). Child self-report: 8-12 years, and 13-18 years. Young adult self-report: 18-25 years. Parent proxy report: 2-4 years, 5-7 years, 8-12 years, and 13-17 years.
Itch and fatigue identified as predominant symptoms in PSC are measured through the administration (at every visit) of the 5-D ITCH scale and the PedsQL multidimensional fatigue and PROMIS Sleep Scales.
Frailty parameters in children with PSC are measured through the Fried frailty criteria at every visit.</description>

    <description>The imaging modalities are utilized to explore the two pathophysiological processes of PSC, liver fibrosis and bile duct damage. Quantitative MRI techniques may be more sensitive to disease progression than standard clinical and laboratory tests, as the liver and bile ducts are being explored directly.</description>

    <description>Samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), serum, plasma, DNA and stool are collected from participants at baseline and serum/plasma will be collected annually. In addition, any liver tissue previously collected or collected for clinical purposes in the future will be analyzed along with the PBMC, serum, plasma, DNA and stool within future mechanistic ancillary studies related to the diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers, and genetic, immune and microbial theories of pathogenesis.</description>
