      Lower and upper extremities of 36 health subjects will be measured be trained experts to
      collect measures for made-to-measure compression garments.

      Fit of made-to-measure compression garments, which are not on the market yet, among healthy
      subjects will be tested on one day, simulating daily activities. Fit will be assessed
      directly after donning and after a wearing period of maximum 7 hours at the study site by
      trained experts. Healthy subjects will give back study products at the end of the wearing
      period. AEs will be documented throughout the study.
