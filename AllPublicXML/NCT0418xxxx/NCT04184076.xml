      Many preclinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting
      (IF) in a wide range of neurological and cardiovascular diseases. This pilot study aims to
      investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF intervention
      called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke (AIS).

      Specific Aims This project is to conduct a pilot, phase II randomized clinical trial which
      aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF
      intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS) The primary endpoint is the safety and compliance of 4 weeks of
      TRF in AIS patients.

      The secondary endpoints are the efficacy of 4 weeks of TRF compared to normal eating (NE) on
      plasma and imaging biomarkers and functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.

      This study will determine whether compared to NE control:

        1. TRF (16 hours fasting daily) is safe and well-tolerated in patients with AIS.

        2. TRF improves functional outcome compared to NE in AIS patients. (3) TRF decreases plasma
           pro-inflammatory cytokines including metallopeptidase (MMP)-9, interleukin (IL)-6, and
           tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in plasma compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.

      (4) TRF improves diffusion tensor imaging on MRI at 3 months post stroke compared to baseline
      and NE in AIS patients.

      (5) TRF changes plasma exosome components, metabolomics and lipidomics compared to baseline
      and NE in AIS patients.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke in-evolution is defined as an increase in the NIHSS score of ≥2 points compared to initial score or the lowest score during admission, excluding other attributable medical or systemic causes.
Stroke recurrence is defined as newly developed neurological deficit due to acute cerebrovascular insult during the study period.
Hypoglycemia event is defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia fulfilling the criteria of Whipple's triad as symptoms known or likely to be caused by hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose (&lt; 60 mg/dl) measured at the time of the symptoms and relief of symptoms when the glucose is raised to normal</description>

    <description>Controls will be instructed to maintain their weight throughout the trial, and not to change their eating or physical activity habits. Controls will visit the research center on a weekly basis for weigh-ins. Body composition and metabolic disease risk variables will be assessed in control subjects every 12 weeks.
Subjects will complete a 3-d food record (2 regular day and 1 holiday) each week during the experiment.
The blood draws will be taken at approximately 11:00 am. The following analyzes will be measured in plasma samples: ketones, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c, liver function, renal function, albumin, lipid profiles, MMP-9, IL-6, TNF-alpha, exosome markers (phospho-IRS1, phospho-Tau, Abeta1-42). Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses will be performed on the baseline and 3-month time point plasma samples.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be instructed to eat ad libitum from 10:00 to 18:00 h daily, and fast from 18:00 to 10:00 h daily. During the 8-h feeding window, there will be no restrictions on types or quantities of foods consumed. During the fasting period, subjects will be encouraged to drink plenty of water and will be permitted to consume energy-free beverages.
Subjects will complete a 3-d food record (2 regular day and 1 holiday) each week during the experiment.
The blood draws will be taken at approximately 11:00 am, especially prior to the first consumption of food by subjects in the TRF group. The following analyzes will be measured in plasma samples: ketones, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c, liver function, renal function, albumin, lipid profiles, MMP-9, IL-6, TNF-alpha, exosome markers (phospho-IRS1, phospho-Tau, Abeta1-42). Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses will be performed on the baseline and 3-month time point plasma samples.</description>

    <intervention_name>Time-restricted feeding (TRF) with dietary counseling</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will be instructed to administer time-restricted feeding.
Subjects have to compete a 3-d food record, including 2 regular day and 1 holiday. At baseline, a dietitian will provide 15 min of instruction to each participant on how to complete the food records. Subjects will be asked to measure the volume of foods consumed with household measures. The timing of food intake will be also recorded. Food records will be collected each week during the experiment and will be reviewed by the dietitian for accuracy and completeness. A database for food content will be used to calculate the total daily intake of energy, fat, protein, carbohydrate, cholesterol, and fiber. All subjects will be asked to maintain their level of physical activity throughout the entire trial.
Blood withdraw will be performed prior to the first consumption of food and analyze some biochemistry data.</description>
