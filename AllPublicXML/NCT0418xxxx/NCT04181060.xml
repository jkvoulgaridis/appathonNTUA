    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the effect of bevacizumab and AZD9291 (osimertinib) combination
      vs. osimertinib alone for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has spread outside
      of the lungs (stage IIIB-IV) and has a change (mutation) in a gene called EGFR. The EGFR
      protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell division and survival.
      Sometimes, mutations in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher than normal
      amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly.
      Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EGFR that is needed for cell
      growth in this type of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving osimertinib with bevacizumab may
      control cancer for longer and help patients live longer as compared to osimertinib alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of AZD9291 (osimertinib) and bevacizumab
      versus AZD9291 (osimertinib) alone as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic
      EGFR-mutant lung cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS). II. To evaluate overall response rate. III. To evaluate
      time to central nervous system (CNS) progression. IV. To evaluate safety/toxicity of the
      combination regimen.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291 (osimertinib) and AZD9291
      (osimertinib) with bevacizumab first-line therapy through post-progression circulating
      tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA).

      II. To assess for ctDNA clearance on study treatment and associate ctDNA clearance with
      clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-21 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV)
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 10 years.
