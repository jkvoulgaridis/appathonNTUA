  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-visit, non-randomized, bilateral, cross-sectional study. In a pre-screening
      assessment, potential subjects will be invited to complete a web-based questionnaire that is
      validated to determine symptomatic vs asymptomatic contact lens wearers. Results of this
      questionnaire will be used to determine whether subjects are eligible to proceed to Visit 1.
      During Visit 1, cell samples will be collected from the front surface of the subject's eyes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form

               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
                  protocol.

               3. Be between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive) at the time of screening

               4. They have worn the same brand of soft contact lenses for at least the previous
                  three months.

               5. They agree not to participate in other clinical research trials for the duration
                  of this study.

               6. In a pre-study screening assessment, they must have a CLDEQ-8 score of 10 or less
                  (asymptomatic group) or 20 or higher (symptomatic group).

               7. They possess a wearable pair of distance glasses and agree to bring these to the
                  study visit (if needed for distance vision correction).

               8. They can attain a high contrast logMAR visual acuity of 0.20 or better in their
                  habitual contact lenses.

               9. Their habitual contact lenses fit satisfactorily.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
             participating in the study:

               1. Currently pregnant or lactating

               2. Any systemic disease (e.g., Sj√∂gren's Syndrome), allergies, infectious disease
                  (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive diseases (e.g.,
                  HIV), autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or other diseases, by
                  self-report, which are known to interfere with contact lens wear and/or
                  participation in the study

               3. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens
                  wear.

               4. They have had cataract surgery.

               5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

               6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear
                  or have keratoconus.

               7. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial
                  research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.

               8. They are regularly (once per day or more) using oral or inhaled steroids or
                  anti-inflammatory medications.

               9. They are using any topical medications such as eye drops or ointments.

              10. History of allergic reaction to sodium fluorescein or topical anesthetic.

              11. Use of systemic medications (e.g., chronic steroid use) that are known to
                  interfere with contact lens wear

              12. Employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,
                  Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).

              13. They have Grade 3 or greater of any of the following ocular surface signs:
                  corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining (white light
                  evaluation), tarsal conjunctival changes or any other abnormality which would
                  normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

              14. Any active ocular infection or inflammation.
