    <textblock>
      The ultrasound-guided selective blockade of the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal
      provides effective analgesia and reduces postoperative pain in patients undergoing
      arthroscopic medial meniscectomy. Selective blockade of the saphenous nerve in the adductor
      canal provides effective analgesia without quadriceps muscle weakness. It has been shown that
      the adductor canal block (ACB) block increases the spread of local anesthetics in a distal
      and proximal way. Therefore, the proximal spread of local anesthetics may cause possible
      quadriceps weakness. The distal spread of local anesthetics may increase analgesic effect via
      sciatic nerve. The different volumes for ACB is a topic of discussion. The aim of this study
      is to compare the different volumes of US-guided ACB performing for postoperative analgesia
      management after total knee arthroplasty surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee arthroplasty is one of the most common orthopedic procedures. Patients may complain
      severe pain due to the surgical trauma and the prosthesis. Opioid agents are commonly used
      for analgesia management. However, opioids have adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting,
      sedation and respiratory depression. Peripheral nerve blocks such as femoral block, adductor
      canal block (ACB) may be performed to reduce opioid consumption and opioid-related side
      effects.

      Selective blockade of the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal for knee surgery provides
      effective analgesia without quadriceps muscle weakness. This is an important advantage of ACB
      since it there is no motor blockade in the postoperative period. Blocking of the motor
      branches leads to delaying of the mobilization and it increases the patient's falling risk.
      ACB, targets the saphenous nerve and the vastus medialis branch which are the two largest
      sensorial nerves of the femoral nerve that innervates the knee. ACB blocks the articular
      branches of the obturator nerve at the same time. Since the ACB is performed at the distal
      site of thigh it does not target majority of the efferent branches of the quadriceps muscle,
      therefore the strength of this muscle may not be affected. ACB is usually performed with a
      volume of 10-30 ml and studies may be needed including different volumes to understand its
      effectiveness.

      The aim of this study is to compare the different volumes (20 ml, 30 ml, and 40 ml) of
      US-guided ACB for postoperative analgesia management after total knee arthroplasty. The
      primary aim is to compare postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), motor blockage, the first mobilization time, and
      adverse effects related with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).

    <description>ACB will be performed at the end of the surgery, before extubation. After identifying the adductor canal, by using the in-plane technique, the probe will be placed at the mid-thigh, half the distance between the inguinal crease and the patella, for block location. The superficial femoral artery will be visualized dorsal to the sartorius muscle. Then, the probe will be removed to distally. At this level, the hyperechoic view of the saphenous nerve will be visualized lateral and anterior to the artery in the subsartorial region. 5 mL of saline will be injected to confirm the proper injection site, and then a dose of 0.25% bupivacaine 20ml will be injected here.</description>
