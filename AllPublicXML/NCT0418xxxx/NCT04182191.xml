    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the different gene haplotypes for the clinical efficacy
      of tenoxicam after third lower molar surgery for pain, edema and trismus, adverse reactions,
      need of rescue medication, patient satisfaction regarding the drug and the pharmacokinetics
      of the drug between the different gene haplotypes for CYP2C9 that are found in this
      population

      Pharmacogenetics is an area of Pharmacology that studies the contribution of genetic factors
      to individual responses to drugs. This branch of science involves the variability in
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics through the study of polymorphisms in genes encoding
      receptors, as well as in drug metabolism, where this area of Pharmacology has been growing
      and achieving its first results with clinical use. The NSAIDS are metabolized by cytochrome
      P450 (CYP) family, predominantly CYP2C9. The goal of this study is to evaluate the different
      gene haplotypes for the clinical efficacy of tenoxicam after third lower molar surgery for
      pain, edema and trismus, adverse reactions, need of rescue medication, patient satisfaction
      regarding the drug and the pharmacokinetics of the drug between the different gene haplotypes
      for CYP2C9 that are found in this population. Therefore, 100 patients will be genotyped and
      phenotyped for this gene and their postoperative data will be confronted with the data found
      in the Brazilian population. For the analysis of the proposed gene, saliva will be collected
      and serve as a source of genomic DNA. For the molecular analysis, polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) with tests validated and produced by Applied Biosystems® will be performed. The
      analysis of the results will be described with a significance level of 0.05.

    <description>Change of pain after third molar surgery is measured by visual analogue scale. It is expected that the visual analogue scale 100mm present lower values in patients heterozygous and mutated for the CYP2C9 the evaluated periods of 0, 15, 30,45 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16 , 24 48 and 72 hours after surgery. Lower values on this scale means lower pain suffered by the volunteers.</description>
