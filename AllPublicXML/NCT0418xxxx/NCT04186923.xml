  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a parent with minor children falls ill with cancer, it is extremely stressful for all of
      the family members, including the partner and children. Familiar everyday routines are often
      disrupted even at an early stage, and for a prolonged period. Financial difficulties, the
      threat represented by the uncertain course of the disease, and worries about the children's
      future have a cumulative effect. The affected families are thereby pushed to their limits
      organizationally and emotionally. The burden involved tends to be underestimated, and
      secondary psychological conditions often develop among all the family members. They often do
      not have adequate access to support.

      The aim of this project is to establish a care management system that provides support for
      families with underage children in which one parent is seriously ill. In order to reduce the
      burden on families, &quot;family SCOUTS&quot; are to be used who can provide advice and information at
      an early stage. They are intended to encourage families to discuss things openly, and they
      should also facilitate access to all the support services available.

      The project will evaluate whether the use of family SCOUTS reduces the burden on the family
      in comparison with families who do not have a family SCOUT. For this purpose, investigations
      will be carried out before and after the family SCOUTS are deployed. Standardized
      questionnaires, interviews, and routine data from the participating health-insurance
      companies will provide the basic data.
