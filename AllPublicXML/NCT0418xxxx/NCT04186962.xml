  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the acceptability and feasibility of a brief
      behavioural intervention involving Tetris gameplay to prevent intrusive traumatic memories in
      parents after paediatric intensive care. The present acceptability and feasibility study
      seeks to answer the following questions: (1) Is this intervention acceptable to parents whose
      children have been admitted to PICU, (2) how practical is it to deliver the intervention in
      this setting, (3) willingness of hospital staff to be involved in the recruitment of
      participants, (4) after having taken part in the intervention themselves would parents have
      been willing to consent to their child taking part in the intervention, and (5) discover any
      challenges or barriers in carrying out this study. Furthermore, this study aims to estimate
      recruitment, withdrawal and dropout rate, in order to act as a preliminary test of the effect
      of the intervention and inform sample size estimation. The findings from this study will
      inform the design of a randomised control trial.

    <measure>Number of flashbacks recorded by participants in a Flashback Record</measure>
    <time_frame>Flashback Record will be returned to a researcher at one week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the number of times a participant experiences intrusive traumatic memories related to PICU and/or the events leading to their child's admission to PICU. This will be measured using a daily pen-and-paper diary in which participants will record the occurrence of intrusive memories in everyday life for one week, starting on the day after the participant completes baseline assessment (Day 1) and completed for seven days</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent of a child in PICU, therefore exposed to an event meeting DSM-5 criterion for a
             traumatic event (APA, 2013).

          -  The parent's child must be near the point of discharge from PICU (site 1 and 2), as
             identified by a clinician, or on a paediatric hospital ward within 24 hours after
             discharge from PICU (site 2 only).

          -  Sufficient ability to read and understand English to provide consent, follow game
             instructions and complete measures.

          -  Have sufficient physical mobility to play TETRIS using a computer (e.g. a handheld
             Nintendo DS).

          -  Willing and able to complete measures and be contacted one-week and month
             post-intervention to complete follow-up measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents will be excluded from the study if their child is due to be discharged to
             palliative care and/or if nursing/medical staff within the PICU feel it would be
             inappropriate to contact them/have them participate in this study.
