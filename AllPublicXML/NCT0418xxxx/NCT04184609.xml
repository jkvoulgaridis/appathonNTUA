      The overall objective of this study is to delineate specific contributions of obesity-related
      respiratory limitations vs. asthma-related bronchoconstriction in children with obesity and
      asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who suffer from obesity and asthma report poor asthma control and high use of rescue
      medications primarily due to increased dyspnea on exertion (DOE). Obesity alters breathing
      mechanics and increases respiratory limitations during exercise, which can provoke DOE.
      Unfortunately the role of obesity in causing DOE is underappreciated during
      diagnosis/management of DOE in asthmatic children with obesity.

      For example, children with obesity and asthma experience asthma-related respiratory
      limitations such as bronchoconstriction, which would respond to &quot;asthma medications&quot;, but
      they also experience obesity-related respiratory limitations, which would not respond to
      &quot;asthma medications&quot;, or they could suffer from both. Considering the alarming reports of
      poor symptom control and high DOE in children with obesity and asthma, there is a critical
      need to identify the separate contributions of obesity-related vs. asthma-related mechanisms
      in development of DOE so we can better diagnose/manage this unique patient population.
      Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to delineate specific contributions of
      obesity-related respiratory limitations vs. asthma-related bronchoconstriction in children
      with obesity and asthma.

      We will use an exercise-testing model to concurrently assess obesity-related respiratory
      limitations and asthma-related bronchoconstriction in 9-12-year-old asthmatic children with
      and without obesity. We will phenotype participants based on their bronchoconstriction
      response to exercise: No bronchoconstriction (i.e., &lt;10% fall in forced expiratory volume in
      1s [FEV1]) and Yes bronchoconstriction (i.e., ≥10% fall in FEV1). Since short-acting
      bronchodilators like albuterol are a standard-of-care pre-exercise prescription to prevent
      asthma-related bronchoconstriction, we will also determine the extent to which albuterol is
      effective in reducing DOE and asthma-related bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children with
      and without obesity.
