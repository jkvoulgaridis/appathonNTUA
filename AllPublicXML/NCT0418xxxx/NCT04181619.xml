  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of soccer skill performance has 3 objectives. Objective 1 is to compare effects of
      coffeeberry (300mg) and placebo ingestion on dribbling speed and precision and passing and
      shooting speed and accuracy compared to placebo. 30 subjects will be assessed before dosing,
      after a 1 hr resting absorption period, and after simulated soccer match play. Of these 30,
      20 subjects will proceed to Objective 2 (45 minutes of intense simulated soccer match play)
      and Objective 3 (repeated sprint activity continued until volitional fatigue).
