  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Vascular Accidents (stroke) and Myocardial Infarction (MI), which share the same
      risk factors, treatments and pathophysiological mechanisms, have become two major public
      health problems due to the increase in their prevalence rate and the longer survival after
      such an event in developed countries.

      International data, including French data and data from our own registries, illustrate that:

        -  risk factors that are common, mainly hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol or
           diabetes, remain insufficiently controlled, although they are easily detectable and
           treatable;

        -  the incidence rate of stroke has doubled in 20 years in people under 55 years of age,
           increasing the number of people with chronic disabilities;

        -  1-month and 1-year mortality rates for stroke and MIs have decreased by 17% in 5 years,
           increasing the number of survivors but with chronic disabilities;

        -  the aging of the population and the arrival of the baby boomers of the 1950s in the
           at-risk age groups has increased the at-risk population;

        -  Stroke and MI recurrence rates reached a threshold of 6% / year, in contrast to the very
           high rates of re-hospitalization at 1 year: 30% post-stroke and 20% post-MI, due to
           poorly anticipated and controlled complications. These reasons explain the lack of
           significant progress in preventing recurrences, preventable complications (heart failure
           and arrhythmias after MI; falls, sphincter and swallowing disorders, dementia and
           arrhythmias after stroke) and re-admission. This observation is aggravated by problems
           of medical demography and therefore the availability of neurologists, cardiologists and
           general practitioners.

      Local and foreign experiments have demonstrated the value of intensive, coordinated and
      multi-professional stroke and MI monitoring, including nurses, in terms of: better control of
      risk factors and reduction of the rate of re-hospitalization by recurrence in stroke
      follow-up; improvement of the patient's general condition, control of risk factors, reduction
      in the number of events, decrease in the number of re-hospitalizations and their duration in
      MI follow-up. The value of pharmacists' additional intervention in intensive post-MI
      follow-up compared to routine follow-up has also been demonstrated, particularly in terms of
      significant improvement in patient compliance.

      The hypothesis is that 2 years of intensive follow-up for both post-stroke or post-MI
      patients, by trained hospital and liberal nurses, in conjunction with doctors and
      pharmacists, is of medico-economic interest compared to usual follow-up. Therefore a
      medico-economic evaluation was designed to evaluate the efficiency of this model, which
      combines community-based and recourse care, prevention and coordination of care compared to
      usual follow-up.
