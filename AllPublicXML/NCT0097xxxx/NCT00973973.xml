  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate elagolix (NBI-56418) compared to placebo for its
      effects on endometriosis related pelvic pain and its safety.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized (1:1) to 150 mg elagolix once daily or placebo once daily for
      the first 8 weeks of the study. Following 8 weeks of dosing, participants continued in the
      study for an additional 16 weeks in an open-label phase where all participants still enrolled
      in the study received 150 mg elagolix once daily.

      There was no pre-specified primary efficacy end point for this study as there is no single
      key efficacy outcome measure in this exploratory Phase 2 study. However, the efficacy
      measures of primary interest included the daily assessment of dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual
      pelvic pain and dyspareunia on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe)
      using an e-Diary.

        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day of their period in an electronic diary (e-Diary) according to the following response options:
0 = No discomfort
1 = Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do
2 = Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do
3 = Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.
The monthly mean dysmenorrhea score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Score During the Open-label and Posttreatment Phases</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their pelvic pain not related to menses and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day they were not having their period in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0 = No discomfort
1 = Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do
2 = Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do
3 = Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.
The monthly mean non-menstrual pelvic pain score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit, except for the week 30 value which is based on 6 weeks of data.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Cumulative Pain Score During the Open-label and Posttreatment Phases</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea or non-menstrual pelvic pain at approximately the same time each day in an e-Diary according to the following:
0: No discomfort
1: Mild discomfort, I was easily able to do the things I usually do
2: Moderate discomfort or pain making it difficult to do some of the things I usually do
3: Severe pain making it difficult to do the things I usually do
The monthly mean cumulative pain score is the average of the daily values for all days (menstrual and non-menstrual) reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit, except for the week 30 value which is based on 6 weeks of data.</description>

        <description>Participants assessed their dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) at approximately the same time every day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0 = Absent; No discomfort during sexual intercourse

3 = Severe; I avoided intercourse because of pain
Does not apply; I was not sexually active for reasons other than my endometriosis or did not have sexual intercourse

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Dyspareunia Score During the Open-label and Posttreatment Phases</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) at approximately the same time every day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0: Absent; No discomfort during sexual intercourse
1: Mild; I was able to tolerate the discomfort during sexual intercourse
2: Moderate; Intercourse was interrupted due to pain
3: Severe; I avoided intercourse because of pain
Does not apply; I was not sexually active for reasons other than my endometriosis or did not have sexual intercourse
The monthly mean dyspareunia score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit, except for week 30 which is based on 6 weeks of data. Responses of &quot;does not apply&quot; were not included in the calculations.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Response in Monthly Mean Dysmenorrhea Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day of their period in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0: No discomfort
1: Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do
2: Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do
3: Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.
The monthly mean dysmenorrhea score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each time point.
Response was defined as the percentage of participants with a percent decrease from baseline in the week 8 monthly mean score that was greater than or equal to each specified threshold value (10% through 90% in steps of 10%).</description>

        <description>Participants assessed their pelvic pain not related to menses and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day they were not having their period in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0 = No discomfort
1 = Mild discomfort but I was easily able to do the things I usually do
2 = Moderate discomfort or pain that made it difficult to do some of the things I usually do
3 = Severe pain that made it difficult to do the things I usually do.
The monthly mean non-menstrual pelvic pain score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each time point.
Response is defined as the percentage of participants with a percent decrease from baseline in the week 8 monthly mean score that was greater than or equal to each specified threshold value (10% through 90% in steps of 10%).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Days of Prescription Analgesic Use During the Double-Blind Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The daily use of endometriosis analgesics was reported by participants daily using the e-Diary. Participants reported whether the medication was over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription, and, if prescription, whether the medication was a narcotic.
The percentage of days of prescription analgesic use is defined as the number of days in the 4 weeks prior to each study visit that the participant reported the use of a prescription analgesic, divided by the number of study days in the interval that the participant provided an e-Diary report regarding the use of endometriosis analgesics (including a response of &quot;none&quot;).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Days of Narcotic Analgesic Use During the Double-Blind Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The daily use of endometriosis analgesics was reported by participants daily using the e-Diary. Participants reported whether the medication was over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription, and, if prescription, whether the medication was a narcotic.
The percentage of days of narcotic analgesic use is defined as the number of days in the 4 weeks prior to each study visit that the participant reported the use of a narcotic analgesic, divided by the number of study days in the interval that the participant provided an e-Diary report regarding the use of endometriosis analgesics (including a response of &quot;none&quot;).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of the Double-blind Treatment Phase in Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS) Total Score and Component Scores</title>
        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores are based on the participant's assessment of symptoms during the past 28 days; pelvic tenderness and induration were assessed by the investigator based on findings associated with a pelvic examination.
The total CPSSS has a maximum possible value of 15 (total score range: 0 to 15, where a lower score indicates less signs and symptoms of endometriosis or better functioning). Individual component scores range from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to the End of the Double-blind Treatment Phase in Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score (CPSSS) Total Score and Component Scores</title>
          <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores are based on the participant's assessment of symptoms during the past 28 days; pelvic tenderness and induration were assessed by the investigator based on findings associated with a pelvic examination.
The total CPSSS has a maximum possible value of 15 (total score range: 0 to 15, where a lower score indicates less signs and symptoms of endometriosis or better functioning). Individual component scores range from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 10 evaluable e-Diary reports during the double-blind period (intent-to-treat population). The analysis includes participants with non-missing data at baseline and week 8.</population>

        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. Each component was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores are based on the participant's assessment of symptoms during the past 28 days; pelvic tenderness and induration were assessed by the investigator based on findings associated with a pelvic examination.
The total CPSSS has a maximum possible value of 15 (total score range: 0 to 15, where a lower score indicates less signs and symptoms of endometriosis or better functioning). Individual component scores range from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe).</description>

        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the impact of endometriosis in areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the impact of endometriosis on the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 10 evaluable e-Diary reports during the double-blind period (intent-to-treat population). The analysis includes participants with non-missing data at baseline and week 8 for each question.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline to the End of the Open-label Treatment Phase in Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5)</title>
          <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the impact of endometriosis on areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the impact of endometriosis on areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 10 evaluable e-Diary reports during the double-blind period (intent-to-treat population) with data on or after Week 12. The analysis includes participants with non-missing data at baseline and week 24 for each question.</population>
