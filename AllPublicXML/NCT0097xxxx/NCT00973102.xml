      Based on encouraging results from animal studies, the investigators hypothesize that early
      administration of IV Premarin® in patients with hemorrhagic shock will safely reduce
      secondary injury, and improve survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annually in the United States, approximately 30 million people require treatment for
      traumatic injuries in emergency departments. Two million of these patients require
      hospitalization, with several hundred thousand ultimately dying, often due to extreme blood
      loss. Importantly, these traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death and disability for
      children and young adults under the age of 44, with the total cost of trauma in the U.S.
      approaching $260 billion each year.

      Despite advances in pre-hospital care, early resuscitation, surgical interventions and
      intensive care monitoring aimed at the primary traumatic injury, many survivors never
      recover. A significant cause of this mortality and morbidity is thought due to potentially
      preventable secondary injury, namely oxidant injury, inflammation, and apoptosis beginning in
      the first few hours after the severe traumatic event.

      In spite of the current bleak outlook for many of these patients, a series of animal
      investigations have uncovered a promising solution to the problem of the secondary injury
      seen in hemorrhagic shock and other similar processes, namely the early administration of
      estrogen, a strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic compound.

      Based on encouraging results from animal studies, the investigators hypothesize that early
      administration of IV Premarin® in patients with hemorrhagic shock will safely reduce
      secondary injury, and improve survival.

    <description>Survival is defined as the number of patients who were discharged from the hospital alive prior to 28 days post injury or the number of patients still alive in the hospital 28 days post injury. The trial examines the rate of enrolled patients on each arm who survived to 28 days.</description>

    <measure>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the lungs. The trial measures the number of days alive and without ARDS within 28 days post injury. Patients who die within 28 days are given value of 0, similarly, patients who live 28 days but have ARDS for all 28 days. A higher score (greater days) indicates better prognosis. Exudative stage is 0-6 days, proliferative stage is 7-10 days, Fibrotic stage is &gt;10-14 days.</description>

    <description>Patients who were randomized to receive a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg placebo. Due of the faint yellow color of the reconstituted Premarin®, the placebo dose will be prepared with 0.14 ml of Vial 1 of Infuvite Adult Multivitamin and 14 ml of sterile water to generate a similar color and volume. This aliquot will be used only for those study patients who are randomized to the placebo arm. The placebo volume will be approximately equal to the volume which the patient would have received had the patient been randomized to the Premarin arm Considering the small amount of IV multivitamin needed for fluid tinting, it is not expected that the IV multivitamin will have any effect on patients with hemorrhagic shock.</description>

        <title>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Free Survival</title>
        <description>ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the lungs. The trial measures the number of days alive and without ARDS within 28 days post injury. Patients who die within 28 days are given value of 0, similarly, patients who live 28 days but have ARDS for all 28 days. A higher score (greater days) indicates better prognosis. Exudative stage is 0-6 days, proliferative stage is 7-10 days, Fibrotic stage is &gt;10-14 days.</description>

            <description>Patients who were randomized to receive a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg placebo. Due of the faint yellow color of the reconstituted Premarin®, the placebo dose will be prepared with 0.14 ml of Vial 1 of Infuvite Adult Multivitamin and 14 ml of sterile water to generate a similar color and volume. This aliquot will be used only for those study patients who are randomized to the placebo arm. The placebo volume will be approximately equal to the volume which the patient would have received had the patient been randomized to the Premarin arm Considering the small amount of IV multivitamin needed for fluid tinting, it is not expected that the IV multivitamin will have any effect on patients with hemorrhagic shock.
Placebo: One time dose of placebo.</description>
