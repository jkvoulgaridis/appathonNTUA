      1. To determine the effects of tDCS on subjective measures of sleepiness in night-shift
           workers with shift work disorder.

        2. To determine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on vigilance
           in night-shift workers with shift work disorder.

      This is a preliminary single-arm study. The study will last up to 6 weeks including the
      screening period. Subjects will receive active tDCS for 30 minutes before their scheduled
      work hours at least 3x/week for two consecutive weeks.

      Outcome measures will include: psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness
      Scale (KSS)25,26 which will be obtained during the shift work.
