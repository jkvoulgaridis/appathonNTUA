    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib when given together
      with venetoclax in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back
      (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Ruxolitinib and venetoclax may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This
      study is being done to see if the combination of ruxolitinib and venetoclax works better in
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to standard of care chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the safety of ruxolitinib in
      combination with venetoclax.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the preliminary efficacy of the ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination.

      II. To estimate overall and event-free survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess in vitro kinase inhibitor sensitivity using patient bone marrow (or peripheral
      blood) before and after treatment with the ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination.

      II. To use molecular techniques (potentially including next-generation sequencing and/or BH3
      profiling) to examine the mechanisms of response versus (vs.) no response.

      III. To correlate molecular features with the patient response and resistance to venetoclax
      combination therapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib.

      Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and venetoclax PO once daily (QD)
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional cycles of ruxolitinib
      and venetoclax at the discretion of the sponsor-investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

    <measure>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of ruxolitinib and venetoclax in combination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination will be determined according to the &quot;keyboard&quot; Bayesian toxicity probability interval design. The MTD of the ruxolitinib and venetoclax combination will correspond to the dose level closest to the target DLT probability of 30% and will be estimated from observed dose level-specific DLT rates using isotonic regression. The study will start at dose level 0 with a potential escalation/de-escalation decision occurring for each subsequent cohort of 3 enrolled participants according to the predefined keyboard rules until a dose level has been assigned to all 30 subjects.</description>

    <description>The overall incidence of treatment- related and non-treatment- related toxicity will be determined using the safety-evaluable population. The point estimate and 95% confidence intervalI for the proportion of patients with each of these toxicity types will be reported. Each toxicity event (there can be &gt; 1 event per participant) will be tabulated by dose level and summarized by severity and major organ site according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.</description>
