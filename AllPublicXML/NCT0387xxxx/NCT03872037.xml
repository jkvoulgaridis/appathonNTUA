      Background There is little information regarding the longevity of the restored tooth,
      considering the health of the pulp-dentine complex, in children who do not sufficiently
      cooperate with dental treatment.

      Aim To evaluate the longevity of primary molar teeth with an occluso-proximal cavity that was
      treated with the selective removal of carious tissue.

      Design A total of 150 children were allocated to two parallel groups: group 1 (G1, n = 70,
      control, Ketac Molar Easymix®, 3M/ESPE, Seefeld, GE) and group 2 (G2, n = 80, test, Maxxion®,
      FGM, Joinville, BR). The study was double-blinded, and an operator specialized in paediatric
      dentistry performed the selective removal of soft dentine and the restoration of the cavity
      with GIC. During the follow-up periods, the teeth were evaluated via periapical radiography
      by two trained examiners specialized in radiology. Statistical analysis was performed using
      Stata 11.2 software (StataCorp, Texas, USA) and a survival curve (Kaplan-Meier).
