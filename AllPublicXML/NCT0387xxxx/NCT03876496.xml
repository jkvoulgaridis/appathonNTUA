  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness, safety and side effects of
      Sensable®Care System for inpatients. The Sensable®Care System uses pressure sensors and
      computer software to sense how patients are positioned on the bed in order to reduce bed
      falls. The Sensable®Care System Mattress has sensors embedded in them, which will be
      monitored by the nurses in your unit.

      This study has three specific aims:

        1. To assess the comfort of the system when used with hospitalized patients;

        2. To observe how the system can be integrated into nurses' and hospital staff's regular
           workflow to help to modify and improve the system.

        3. To analyze data from nursing response to alerts generated from hospitalized patients to
           improve alert system performance.

    <description>The Sensable®Care Mattress has sensors embedded in it. Sensable®Care System is able to identify if the subject is stirring in bed, sitting up from the bed, attempting to leave the bed, or being out of the bed. If the subject is found to be in any of these four scenarios, four different types of alerts/notifications will warn clinicians: Stirring Notification, Sitting Up Notification, Bed Leaving Alert, Out of Bed Alert, will be generated by Sensable®Care System respectively.
Once these four alerts/notifications are generated, designated attending nurses or caregivers equipped with a mobile app will receive audible, vibratory, and/or visual alerts from the Dashboard with subject's room number and type of alert displayed mobile app. Thus, interventions/assistance can be carried out presumably early. Harm to patient safety may be prevented.</description>
