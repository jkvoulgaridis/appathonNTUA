    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is:

      To demonstrate the potential benefits and risk of active sub-threshold stimulation in the
      treatment of chronic knee pain as compared to subjects that did not have the lead turned on.
      Improvement will be assessed in relation to the clinical outcome measures of pain, with a
      target of &gt; 50% pain relief

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, prospective, sham-controlled, double blinded, randomized
      clinical study.

      A total of eighty evaluable (80) patients with unilateral arthritic knee pain will be
      recruited into this clinical trial from multiple sites. The Principal investigator (PI) will
      screen all of the patients for appropriateness for the procedure. The degree of neuropathic
      pain will be assessed using the DN4 standard questionnaire. A diagnostic injection of the IPS
      under US in the clinic will be performed, and only those patients with significant temporary
      pain relief (&gt; 50%) will be allowed to continue with the study. All patients will be brought
      to the operating/procedure room for the trial implant procedure (OR) and given a local
      anesthetic. An introducer will be placed under ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance at the
      target nerve and the electrodes percutaneously advanced towards the IPS. After confirmation
      of stimulation, the trial lead will be secured to the skin. Subjects will undergo a 7-day
      trial. Only those subjects reporting &gt; 50% pain relief will be allowed to continue with the
      study. The trial leads will be removed at the end of 7 days.

      All subjects responding to therapy will be brought back to the operating room (OR) and given
      a sedative and local anesthetic. An introducer will be placed under ultrasound or
      fluoroscopic guidance onto the target nerve and the electrode array advanced towards the
      nerve. The electrode array will be mated to the receiver stylet, and, after confirmation of
      stimulation, the permanent lead will be tunneled and secured. The patient will then be
      randomized to either active sub-threshold stimulation or no stimulation (sham). All patients
      and assessors will be blinded for up to three months as to activation status.

      Follow-up visits will be conducted at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months
      post-implantation. Follow up phone calls at 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months
      post-implantation will be performed to confirm durability of relief.

      Initial and follow-up evaluations will consist of physical exam, pain scores, Western Ontario
      and McMasters University Arthritis Score (WOMAC), range of motion, ability to do one-legged
      knee bends, work status and medication intake evaluation. At 1-month post-permanent implant,
      if there is not &gt;50% relief, the patient will be unblinded. If sham was confirmed, the lead
      will then be reprogrammed, and the trial continued. If the active arm was confirmed, the lead
      stimulation will be reprogrammed, and the trial continued. All subjects will be unblinded at
      the 3-month visit regardless of randomization and outcome.

      Available stimulation programs include tonic (on table testing), burst, 1499 Hz frequency
      stimulation, all of which may be utilized via the same patient.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A sponsor representative will open the sealed envelopes and assign groups. Investigators and research staff will be blinded to assignment of high frequency or sham. Randomization assignment will be documented post-implant but will be filed separately in a document locker, which will only be available to a sponsor representative until the time of unblinding.
When receiving active stimulation, devices will be programmed to deliver electrical stimulation below perception threshold. Stimulation waveforms delivered above perception threshold have the potential to unblind subjects to their assignments.
When receiving sham stimulation, devices will be programmed to not actively deliver electrical stimulation but still deplete battery life to maintain blinding. Subjects will have to recharge batteries similar to receiving active stimulation.
Sites will not have access to the programmer. Study devices can only be programmed by Stimwave representatives.</masking_description>
