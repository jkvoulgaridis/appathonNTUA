  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use Brain Power Games, a computer-based learning game for children, as
      a neurocognitive &quot;stress test&quot; or medical &quot;challenge&quot; test, in order to evaluate
      brain/behavior functional integrity in HIV-affected children. This dual use of BPG is a key
      innovative feature. Each of the 5 core BPG games lasts 10 minutes and trains fine motor,
      monitoring/attention, visual/auditory working memory, spatial navigational learning. In Year
      3 we'll add an Executive Functioning (EF) test to BPG. As an African child plays with BPG on
      a touch-screen tablet, BPG will use games as a dynamic window into the child's developing
      brain and EF-based frontal lobe development Aim 1. Evaluate concurrent and predictive
      validity of BPG static (baseline) and dynamic (during 12 training sessions) cognitive
      assessments Aim 2. Compare the validity of BPG static and dynamic assessments Aim 3. Test the
      sensitivity of dynamic assessment to learning loss over time by evaluating how much BPG
      performance gains diminish during a 6-month absence of training The investigator's central
      hypothesis is that the performance gains (dynamic assessment) will explain the additional
      variation in the gold-standard measures at time points after static (baseline) assessment,
      and more effectively capture the effects of HIV/ARV exposure and treatment across HIV
      affected cohorts (HIV, HEU, HUU) of children in Uganda and Malawi.

      BPG has been pilot-tested to provide cognitive training for HIV+ school-age Ugandan children
      in impoverished rural areas. Downloading the integrated assessment/training BPG apps and
      using BPG will be free. BPG games are designed for Sub-Saharan culture. Having finished BPG
      mobile apps for tablets, The investigators will validate BPG to assess cognitive changes as a
      child plays with BPG once (a static assessment) and over the course of 12 training sessions
      over 4 weeks (dynamic assessments of cognitive change over time). No computer-based
      intervention-based assessments presently exist for African children, and it is these dynamic
      assessments of cognitive change that will serve as the true window into the child's
      brain/behavior developmental integrity. Analysis of BPG game data will be transmitted to
      investigators via internet on the mobile network in real time to guide game progression and
      difficulty, further customizing and enhancing the technical power of our dynamic assessment
      Following enrollment and physical and medical exams, each child will return to the clinic
      with their principal caregiver for a half-day of gold standard neuropsychological assessments
      (KABC-II, TOVA, CogState). At this time the caregiver will complete the Achenbach CBCL
      questionnaire for school-age children. Within a week after baseline assessment, each child
      will be accompanied to their home, where the Caldwell HOME scale and SES material possessions
      evaluation will be completed with the principal caregiver. Then an internal performance
      evaluation session with BPG will be completed on a tablet at the child's home, supervised by
      the field research assistant. This will be done as part of the 50-60 minute training session
      on the 5 BPG games (about 10 minutes per game), and will constitute the BPG static
      assessment. Thereafter, the field research assistant will return to the home at a convenient
      time and supervise BPG training several times per week until 12 training sessions are
      completed. The 12th session internal evaluation performance measures for the 5 core games and
      one added EF game will provide the endpoint for BPG dynamic assessment (gain in BPG
      performance from session 1 to session 12). Within a week after completing BPG training and
      dynamic assessment, the child and caregiver will return to the clinic for a full gold
      standard neuropsychological evaluation as the caregiver once again completes the CBCL. The
      final step in the study process will be when the field research assistant returns one final
      time to the child's home after 6 months to administer the BPG games and corresponding
      internal performance evaluation one final time.

    <description>TOVA is a computerized visual continuous performance test used in to screen, diagnose and monitor children and adults at risk for ADHD.56 TOVA consists of the rapid (tachistoscopic) presentation of a large geometric square on the computer screen with a smaller dark box either in the upper position (signal) or lower position (non-signal). The child is asked to press a switch held in the preferred hand as fast as possible in response to the signal (measuring vigilance attention), but to withhold responding to the non-signal (measuring impulsivity).</description>

    <description>Brain Powered Games (BPG) is a computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CCRT) program for neurocognitive assessment and treatment of Sub-Saharan African school-age children suffering from neurological symptoms. BPG is especially intended to help children infected with HIV. BPG consists of 5 core games evaluating different cognitive abilities (learning, memory, language, attention). Each game includes a visual tutorial, several adjustable settings on the administrative side (Admin), and records gameplay data for research purposes.</description>
