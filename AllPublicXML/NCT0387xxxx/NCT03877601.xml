  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve detection of esophageal (pre)malignant lesions during surveillance endoscopy of
      patients at risk of developing malignancies, for example in Barrett's Esophagus (BE), there
      is a need for better endoscopic visualization and the ability for targeted biopsies. Optical
      molecular imaging of neoplasia associated biomarkers could form a promising technique to
      accommodate this need. It is known that the biomarker Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      (VEGF) is overexpressed in dysplastic and neoplastic areas in BE segments versus normal
      tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The University Medical
      Center Groningen (UMCG) developed a fluorescent tracer by labeling the VEGF-targeting
      humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, currently used in anti-cancer therapy, with the
      fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. The phase I study, named VICE, completed within the UMCG, showed
      that synchronal use of VEGFA-guided near-infrared fluorescence molecular endoscopy (NIR-FME)
      and high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE), following topical or systemic tracer
      administration, could be practiced to recognize dysplastic and early EAC lesions in patients
      with BE. Furthermore, early lesion detection was improved by ~33% using the topically applied
      tracer approach compared with HD-WL/NBI endoscopy. With this phase 2 intervention study the
      investigators aim to statistically confirm previous pilot (Phase I) clinical data showing
      that the combination of HD-WLE and FME using labelled bevacizumab improves early EC detection
      over the current clinical standard.
