    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures are typically performed
      using general anesthesia. During anesthesia, the anesthesiologist inserts a breathing tube
      (endotracheal tube) into the patient's wind pipe (trachea) and a machine helps the patient
      breathe (mechanical ventilation) while they are unconscious. The breathing tube is inserted
      with a patient laying on his/her back using a rigid metallic device (laryngoscope) to guide
      tube placement. The unconscious patient is then moved from the portable bed onto the X-ray
      table by nursing staff. The patient also has to be turned to lie on their stomach on the
      X-ray table for the procedure. This standard approach carries a small risk of patient injury
      during breathing tube placement as well as while moving and turning the unconscious patient
      onto the X-ray table.

      At our endoscopy unit, endoscopists have, on several occasions, used a slim gastroscope to
      place the breathing tube under direct visualization in patients who are already positioned on
      their stomach for ERCP. This approach is rapid and has been uniformly successful and safe.

      We hypothesize that this endoscopist-facilitated intubation approach may expedite the
      procedure and minimize ergonomic strain for staff during patient repositioning while
      minimizing patient injury during breathing tube placement and repositioning. This study seeks
      to formally compares the two approaches for placement of a breathing tube.

    <description>the patient will be positioned supine on the gurney for intubation, with eventual position in the standard semi-prone ERCP position on the fluoroscopy table. Anesthesiologist-determined doses of Fentanyl, Versed, Propofol and Succinylcholine will be administered per standard of care and intubation will be accomplished by direct laryngoscopy or glidescope, with confirmation of endotracheal tube placement by auscultation.</description>

    <description>the patients will position themselves in the semi-prone position on the fluoroscopy table. Anesthesiologist-determined doses of Fentanyl, Versed and Propofol will be administered per standard of care. Succinylcholine will not be administered and therefore the patient will not be paralyzed. The endotracheal tube will be positioned on the mid-distal aspect of the ultra-slim endoscope and the ultra-slim endoscope will then be advanced into the trachea under direct endoscopic visualization to the level of the carina. The anesthesiologist will then advance the endotracheal tube over the endoscope into the trachea, and its position above the carina will be simultaneously confirmed endoscopically with the ultra-slim endoscope.</description>
