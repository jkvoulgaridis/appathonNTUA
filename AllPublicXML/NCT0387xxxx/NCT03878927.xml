    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of CPX-351 in combination with
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) as first intensive therapy in older (age &gt;55 years) subjects with
      newly diagnosed AML who are eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy, or AML subjects
      who previously failed low-intensity therapy but who would be eligible for high-intensity
      chemotherapy, with companion cognitive function testing to determine whether this contributes
      to outcome in these subjects. Subjects may have received prior AML treatment with
      non-intensive regimens, e.g. hypomethylating agents, low-dose cytarabine, or lenalidomide or
      a clinical trial drug in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine, but
      may not have received intensive AML treatment with anthracyclines and/or infusional
      cytarabine prior to enrollment on this trial. Subjects may not have been treated with GO or
      other antibody targeting CD 33 prior to enrollment on this trial. The cohort will include 30
      subjects treated with the combination of CPX-351 and GO and is designed to establish the
      safety and feasibility of the combination. These subjects will be assessed for efficacy and
      safety. Quality of life will be assessed using the FACT-LEU in all subjects. Cognitive
      function will be assessed using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test and the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of cognitive function to outcome will be assessed using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test. The score for 6 items are multiplied to yield a &quot;weighted&quot; score. The higher the total weighted score, the more likely the patient has cognitive disability.

    <description>The relationship of cognitive function to outcome will be assessed using the MoCA. The MoCA was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>
