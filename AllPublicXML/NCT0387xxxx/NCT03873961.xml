    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the changes of heel pain, functional health
      and well-being after high-intensity and low-level laser therapy for plantar fasciitis or
      Achilles tendinopathy

    <textblock>
      Plantar heel pain, also known as plantar fasciitis, causes soreness or tenderness of the sole
      of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. Pain associated
      with the condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life.
      Achilles tendinitis is a common etiology of posterior heel pain that results in significant
      pain and loss of function. Calf exercise is initial management that may be supported by laser
      therapy. A treatment possibility high-intensity laser therapy is little explored.
      High-intensity lasers can deliver more energy deeper into tissue. The hypothesis is that both
      lasers are effective in treatment of plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinopathy, but
      high-intensity laser therapy is more effective.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the changes of heel pain, functional health
      and well-being after high-intensity and low-level laser therapy for plantar fasciitis or
      Achilles tendinopathy.

      The study was approved by Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of Kaunas Region
      (2016-07-14 No. BE-2-32). Patients are recruited in out patient clinic of Physical Medicine
      and Rehabilitation Department in The Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences
      (LSMU) Kauno klinikos.

    <measure>Functional health and well-being - SF-36v2Â®</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks and 4 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Paper questionnaire for participants to fill in. Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 2 version (SF-36v2) was used. Measure is divided into 8 subscales and 2 composite domains The 8 subscales are Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to Physical Problems, General Health Perceptions, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems, General Mental Health and Health Transition. Respondents were asked to answer items referring to the past 4 weeks Recommended scoring system for the SF-36 is a weighted Likert system for each item Items within subscales are totaled to provide a summed score for each subscale or dimension.
Each of the 8 summed scores is linearly transformed onto a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health) to provide a score for each subscale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 weeks and 4 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Paper questionnaire for participants to fill in. The questionnaire consists of 34 questions grouped into 5 subcategories: pain, stiffness, difficulty, activity limitation, and social issues. The answers are represented by a 4-level Likert scale. The numerical 5 is not a Likert scale; it is an option that the particular question is not applicable. A higher score represents worse condition.</description>

The response to each item is scored by Likert scale from 4 to 0, with 4 being &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 0 being &quot;unable to do&quot;. A higher score represents a higher level of physical function.</description>
