  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to estimate the effect of atorvastatin on muscular symptom intensity in
      coronary patients with subjective statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and to determine
      the association with blood levels of atorvastatin and its metabolites, to obtain an objective
      marker for true SAMS. A randomized study will include 80 coronary patients with SAMS during
      ongoing atorvastatin therapy or previous muscle symptoms that led to discontinuation of
      atorvastatin. Patients will be randomized to 7-weeks treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day in
      the first period and matched placebo in the second 7-weeks period, or placebo in the first
      period and atorvastatin in the second period. A control group (n=40) without muscle symptoms
      will have 7 weeks open treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. Blood samples will be collected
      at baseline and after each treatment period, and muscular symptom intensities will be rated
      by the patients weekly. The primary outcome is the difference in aggregated mean Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) scores between the last three weeks of atorvastatin treatment and of
      placebo treatment. The main purpose is to develop an objective marker for true SAMS, by
      comparing SAMS associated with blinded atorvastatin treatment with blood concentrations of
      atorvastatin and its metabolites. Diagnostic and discrimination performance will be
      determined. The study provides new clinical knowledge on SAMS in coronary patients and may
      contribute to more personalized statin treatment and monitoring, fewer side-effects and
      consequently improved adherence and lipid management in future practice.
