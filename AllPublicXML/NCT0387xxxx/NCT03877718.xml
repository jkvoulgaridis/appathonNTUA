        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to understand and willing to give written informed consent and authorize the

             study.

          2. Men and women with episodic migraine who meet the criteria of the International
             Headache Society's Headache Classification Committee for migraine with or without
             aura.

          3. Between the ages of 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive.

          4. A history of episodic migraine for at least 1 year.

          5. Maximal frequency of 8 migraine attacks per month; minimum frequency of 2 migraine
             attacks per month; at least 48 hours of headache-free time between migraine attacks.

          6. Maximum total headache days of 14 per month.

          7. History of migraine headache with nausea ≥ 50% of the time.

          8. Able and willing to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) to record the details of a
             migraine attack treated with investigational treatment.

          9. Able to swallow a capsule whole.

         10. Report headache on the Headache Pain Scale at Baseline before treatment.

         11. Report the presence of nausea on the Nausea Scale at Baseline before treatment.

         12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must practice an acceptable method of birth
             control (acceptable methods of birth control in this study include: surgical
             sterilization, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch,
             long-acting injectable contraceptive, partner's vasectomy, or a double-barrier method
             [condom or diaphragm with spermicide]). Use of intrauterine devices and hormonal
             contraceptives must begin at least 8 weeks prior to Screening.

         13. Willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition that would preclude
             safe and complete study participation. Such conditions may include cardiac,
             respiratory, hepatic, renal or metabolic diseases, peripheral vascular disease, any
             systemic disease, acute infection, or neurological disease (including Parkinson's
             Disease or other condition associated with a movement disorder), current malignancy or
             recent history (within 5 years) of malignancy (other than squamous cell or basal cell
             carcinoma) or any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes
             the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.

          2. A positive saliva screen for alcohol or a positive urine drug screen for cocaine,
             narcotics, benzodiazepines, opioids, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), barbiturates,
             amphetamines, or any prescription drugs unless such a positive result can be explained
             by stated concomitant medications.

          3. Regularly smoke cigarettes or use opiate analgesic drugs, benzodiazepines, ergot
             containing drugs, alcohol, THC, or other drugs of abuse that, at the discretion of the
             Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the endpoints in the trial.

          4. Unstable use of prophylactic migraine medication (eg, change of dose or type of
             medication) during the 30 days prior to Screening Visit.

          5. Subjects using monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors and who cannot be washed out.

          6. Subjects using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin
             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, THC, or
             systemic corticosteroids over the past month prior to the Screening Visit.

          7. Daily use of antipsychotics at least 15 days prior to randomization.

          8. Medication overuse:

               1. Opioids for headache ≥ 10 days during the 90 days prior to Screening Visit;

               2. Combination medications that contain an opioid and/or barbiturate (eg, Fiorinal®)
                  ≥ 10 days during the 90 days prior to Screening Visit.

               3. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other simple medications ˃ 14
                  days a month during the 90 days prior to Screening Visit.

               4. Triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to Screening Visit.

          9. Use of mini prophylaxis for menstrual migraine.

         10. History of allergic reaction or drug sensitivity to any triptans.

         11. History of allergic reaction or drug sensitivity to promethazine.

         12. History of allergic reaction or drug sensitivity to acetaminophen.

         13. History of extrapyramidal reaction (eg, akathisia or dystonia) to neuroleptic
             treatments.

         14. Subjects who are pregnant (positive urine hCG: Human chorionic gonadotropin test at
             Screening Visit) or breastfeeding.

         15. Use of experimental or investigational treatments and/or participation in drug
             clinical studies within the 6 months before the Screening Visit.

         16. Subjects who are employees of the Sponsor.

         17. Relatives of, or staff directly reporting to, the Investigator.
