             years of historical use.

          8. Able to replace current short-acting β agonist (SABA) with study issued albuterol
             inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study.

          9. Able to withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours prior to lung function
             assessments on study visits.

         10. Able to withhold all inhaled long acting β agonists (LABA) 24 hours before Screening
             Visit 1b.

         11. Able to discontinue current asthma medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids[ICS],
             LABA, etc.) during the Run-in period and for remainder of the study.

         12. Able to comply with study procedures, including correct use of inhaler devices and
             home peak expiratory flow (PEF) device, and maintaining an electronic diary (eDiary).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episodes(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s), or hospitalizations due to asthma within
             the past year prior to Enrollment, or during the Screening or Run-in period.

          2. History of significant respiratory disease other than asthma (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], interstitial lung disease, chronic bronchitis,
