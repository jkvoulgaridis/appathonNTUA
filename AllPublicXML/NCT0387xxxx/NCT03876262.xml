  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase 3b study is to determine the safety and efficacy of
      moxidectin administration twice a year, compared to once a year, in maintaining undetectable
      levels in skin of O. volvulus microfilaria in skin, the parasite that causes river blindness.

      Secondary purposes are to determine the effectiveness of moxidectin compared to ivermectin
      once or twice a year in maintaining undetectable levels, or reducing levels, of skin
      microfilaria.

          -  Provision of written informed consent, or assent with parental or guardian written
             consent

          -  Mean ≥ 10 O. volvulus microfilariae/mg skin, determined by four skin snips

          -  Living in a village selected for the study.

          -  Age ≥ 12 years.

          -  All female participants of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile or
             post-menopausal must commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the
             duration of treatment and until 6 months after completion of dosing with
             investigational product (Month 30).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Any concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude
             evaluation of response to treatment or would pose undue risk to the participant's
             health.

          -  Has received ivermectin, oral diethylcarbamazine (DEC), doxycycline (for &gt; 2 weeks) or
             suramin within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Has received treatment with an investigational agent within the last 30 days (or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer).

          -  Known or suspected allergy to ivermectin or moxidectin or their excipients.

          -  Self-reported planned or ongoing activities within the study period that would make it
             unlikely that a participant will be available for all planned treatment rounds and
             follow-up examinations.

          -  Weight ≥ 88 kg

          -  Infection with Loa loa.
