  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China has the largest burden of cerebrovascular disease in the world. About 60% to 80% of
      which are ischemic stroke. In recent years, stroke has replaced heart disease and tumor
      diseases as the first cause of death and disability in adult population. The primary purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of indobufen treatment in reducing the risk of a
      3-month new stroke (any type of stroke, including ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke) for
      patients with moderate/severe ischemic stroke is not inferior to aspirin therapy.

      China has the largest burden of cerebrovascular disease in the world. About 60% to 80% of
      which are ischemic stroke. In recent years, stroke has replaced heart disease and tumor
      diseases as the first cause of death and disability in adult population. The primary purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of indobufen treatment in reducing the risk of a
      3-month new stroke (any type of stroke, including ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke) for
      patients with moderate/severe ischemic stroke is not inferior to aspirin therapy. The study
      is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, positive drug parallel control and
      non-inferiority clinical design.

      Non-inferiority analysis was performed on the primary efficacy analysis, and both intent
      analysis (ITT) and compliance program set (PPS) were used for analysis. If the indobufen
      group was confirmed to be non-inferior to aspirin (control group), a superiority analysis was
      further performed to analyze whether the indobufen was superior to aspirin. At the same time,
      Kaplan-Meier curves were used to simulate the cumulative risk of stroke (ischemic or
      hemorrhagic) at 90-day follow-up, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to
      calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval, Log-rank test was used to
      evaluate the treatment effect. All statistics will be two-sided with p&lt;0.05 considered
      significant.

      All patients who received study drugs and with at least one safety follow-up record will be
      included in the safety population. The data for safety evaluation included adverse reactions
      observed during the trial and changes in laboratory data before and after treatment.

    <time_frame>During the 3-month and 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. It has become the most widely used clinical outcome measure for stroke clinical trials. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death: 0 - No symptoms.1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.6 - Dead. The mRS scores between 3 to 6 points are considered to be poor functional outcome.</description>

    <measure>Changes in neurological impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 3 months compared to baseline. The NIHSS is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0. Stroke severity: 0 No stroke symptoms;1-4 Minor stroke;5-15 Moderate stroke;16-20 Moderate to severe stroke;21-42 Severe stroke</description>

    <time_frame>3 months and 1 year after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the EQ-5D-5L scale to evaluate the quality of life. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has been widely used in population health surveys, clinical studies, economic evaluation and in routine outcome measurement in the delivery of operational healthcare. The EQ-5D-5L has five domain scales (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression) and five levels for each domain.</description>
