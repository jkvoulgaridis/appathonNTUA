  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to analyze if the number of meals with adequate protein
      intake is associated with functionality in middle to older aged mexican adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary protein intake per meal was assessed with 24-h dietary recalls to determine the
      number of meals with adequate protein intake (&gt;30 g, &gt;0.4 g/kg). Functionality was assessed
      with self-reported questionnaires about daily living activities (Barthel), and instrumental
      activities of daily living (Lawton). Subjects were categorized according the number of meals
      with adequate protein intake (zero meals, one meal, two or three meals), and their
      functionality score for both questionnaires (high, middle, and low scores).

      With multinomial logistic regression, the investigators assessed if consuming zero or one
      meal with adequate protein intake could be associated with lower functionality in comparison
      with consuming two or three meals with enough protein. The logistic regression was adjusted
      for covariables (age, sex, BMI categories for the elderly, number of diagnosed diseases,
      inadequate protein intake per day [&lt;1.2 g/kg/d]).

    <description>Functionality score for instrumental activities of daily living (assessed with Lawton questionnaire). This instrument assess how well the subject perform some daily activities involving tools (e.g. handling finances, taking medication, using the telephone). The instrument consists on five items for men and eight for women, and each item is coded for 0 or 1 depending on if subjects are capable to successfully complete the activity. Therefore, the score ranges from 0 to 5 in men and 0 to 8 in women, the higher the score, the more functional the subj</description>

    <measure>Functionality on Activities of Daily Living - Barthel questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Functionality score for activities of daily living (assessed with Barthel questionnaire). This instrument assess how well the subject perform some daily activities (e.g. dressing, using stairs). The instrument consists on ten items for both men and women coded as 0 or multiples of 5 (i.e. 5, 10, 15) depending on if subjects are capable to successfully complete the activity. The score ranges from 0 to 100 for both men and women, the higher the score, the more functional the subject.</description>
