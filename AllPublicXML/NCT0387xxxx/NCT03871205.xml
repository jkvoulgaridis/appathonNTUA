  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various of immunotherapies are now widely applied in the treatment of lung cancer.
      Neoantigens arising from the mutations of the tumor genome expressed specifically on the
      tumor cell instead of normal cells, suggesting that vaccines targeting neoantigens should
      generate a highly tumor-specific response with minimal off-target effects. Neoantigens are
      highly suitable for the development of cancer vaccines. The study aims to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of neoantigen-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccines for refractory lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer genome research has exploded benefits from the application of modern high-throughput
      genome sequencing in the past few years. Since usually there are no common antigens expressed
      on the surfaces of different kinds of tumors, neoantigens which expressed specifically in the
      individual tumor are chosen to establish tumor-specific vaccines.

      30 patients with refractory lung cancer would be enrolled and undergo tumor resection if all
      requirements are met. The whole-exome sequencing and the bioinformatic analysis of the
      resected specimens would be performed to identify the neoantigens. Then, candidate
      neoantigens would be synthesized to pulse the matured DC cells. Neoantigen-primed DC vaccines
      are provided to the corresponding patients. Each patient would be vaccinated 6 times in
      total, one shot per week.

      Patients enrolled would undergo the schemed follow-up, one time per three months. The side
      effects, overall survival, and progress-free survival would be recorded. At the end of the
      research, the safety and efficacy of neoantigen DC vaccines for refractory lung cancer would
      be evaluated.

    <time_frame>3 months after the last vaccination injection</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of personalized neoantigen vaccine will be measured by the number of subjects experiencing each type of adverse event. Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>once per three months</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate is equal to the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR). Percentage of Participants Achieving a Stable Disease (SD) or a confirmed CR or PR (Disease Control Rate) Participants achieved disease control if they had a best overall response of CR, PR or SD.</description>

    <description>OS was defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the cut-off date, OS was censored at the last known date alive.</description>
