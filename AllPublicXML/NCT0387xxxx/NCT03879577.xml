        Exclusion Criteria:

             appropriate contraceptive method. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Patients of

          3. Serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infection(s).

          4. Treatment for other carcinomas within the last 5 years, except non-melanoma skin
             cancer and treated cervical carcinoma in-situ (CCIS)

          5. Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment

          6. Other serious uncontrolled medical conditions that the investigator feels might
             compromise study participation including but not limited to chronic or active
             infection, HIV-positive patient, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          7. Patients with HER2-negative disease
