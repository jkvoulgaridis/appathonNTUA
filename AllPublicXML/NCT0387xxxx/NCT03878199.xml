      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of ruxolitinib when given together with
      daunorubicin (CPX-351) and to see how well they work in treating patients with secondary
      acute myeloid leukemia transformed from myeloproliferative neoplasms. Ruxolitinib may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. CPX-351 is
      a mixture of 2 chemotherapy drugs (daunorubicin and cytarabine) given for leukemia in small
      fat-based particles (liposomes) to improve the drug getting into cancer cells. Giving
      ruxolitinib and CPX-351 may work better in treating patients with secondary acute myeloid
      leukemia compared to CPX-351 alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) for treatment of
      post-myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase I) II. To
      evaluate the rate of composite complete remission (CCR) by the end of induction or
      re-induction in patients with secondary AML transformed from MPNs (polycythemia vera [PV],
      essential thrombocythemia [ET] and myelofibrosis [MF]) following treatment with the
      combination of ruxolitinib and CPX-351. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in combination with CPX-351 for
      treatment of post-MPN AML. (Phase I) II. Assess survival outcomes and proportion of patients
      receiving transplant associated with ruxolitinib in combination with CPX-351. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the proportion of treated (completion of induction or re-induction) participants
      with sub-clinical levels of AML (i.e., minimal residual disease, MRD) as measured by flow
      cytometry and/or next generation sequencing of known mutations (e.g., JAK-2, CALR and other
      disease-specific mutations). (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib followed by a phase II
      study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5
      and ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 6-28 of cycle 1.

      RE-INDUCTION: Patients with significant residual disease or those do not achieve a complete
      response (CR) or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) receive CPX-351 IV
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 and ruxolitinib PO BID on days 4-28 of cycle 2. Patients who
      have persistent disease following 2 cycles of therapy (induction and re-induction) will be
      offered salvage chemotherapy.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients who achieve a CR or CRi after induction and re-induction therapy
      receive CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 and ruxolitinib PO BID on days 4-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients who successfully complete consolidation therapy with a
      continued CR/CRi and have not undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) receive
      ruxolitinib PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients may undergo an allogeneic SCT at any time
      after achieving CR/CRi if they have a suitable donor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 2
      months for up to 1 year.

    <description>A Simon's two-stage minimax design will be used. The null hypothesis that the true composite complete remission rate is 0.35 (based on historical data) will be tested against a one-sided alternative of a composite complete remission rate of 0.60 with the combination of CPX-351 and ruxolitinib. In the first stage, 18 patients will be accrued. If there are 6 or fewer composite complete remissions in these 18 patients by the end of induction or re-induction therapy, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 26 patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the combination therapy deemed promising if 14 or more composite complete remissions are observed during induction or consolidation cycles among the 26 patients.</description>
