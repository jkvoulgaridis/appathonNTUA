      informed consent with participation in the study.

      demographic characteristics (age, sex, diagnosis), and complications during catheter
      insertion, the number of days when the Midline catheter was inserted, number of changes of
      the dressings, presence of neutropenia in the study subjects and the score of local
      inflammation according to Madonna.
