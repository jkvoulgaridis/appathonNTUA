  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to examine the
      feasibility of a brief, adjunctive mindfulness intervention tailored to the needs of
      adolescents with severe obesity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether it is feasible to integrate a brief,
      adjunctive mindfulness intervention with the standard medical management of obesity in
      adolescents with severe obesity. Mindfulness refers to the experience of paying attention to
      the present moment in a nonjudgmental manner. Mindfulness training enhances one's ability to
      cope with negative emotions and one's awareness of decision-making processes and internal
      experiences.

      The proposed study has two specific aims: 1) to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the mindfulness intervention in a
      sample of 30 adolescents with severe obesity; and 2) to examine the preliminary efficacy of
      the mindfulness intervention on BMI, emotion regulation, eating and weight-related behaviors,
      impulsivity, waist circumference, and blood pressure in comparison to the standard of care.

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction: satisfaction survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post study start date</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess participants' satisfaction with the intervention by having them complete a satisfaction survey at the end of the program to assess perceived helpfulness of the intervention and to elicit feedback on the various components. Participants respond to 6 questions (e.g., &quot;I enjoyed being a part of this program&quot;) on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An average across scores will be calculated with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction. Possible scores range from 1 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDEQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks and 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report instances of binge eating, loss of control eating, and compensatory behaviors via 6 items of the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDEQ). Participants report how often they engaged in each behavior over the past 28 days 0 (no days) to 28 (every day). Higher scores represent greater eating pathology. Scores on each item will be examined separately to determine the rate of each behavior. Scores across items will not be summed or averaged.</description>

    <description>Participants will provide a detailed account of the foods and beverages consumed for the day prior to an assessment using the Automated Self-administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall (ASA24). The ASA24 is a web-based software tool that self-administers 24 hour dietary recalls .</description>

    <measure>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale - Short Form (DERS - SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks and 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale - Short Form (DERS - SF) is an 18-item, widely used self-report measure of emotion regulation problems. Participants respond to items on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The DERS-SF has 6 sub scales that each consist of three items (Strategies, Non-acceptance, Impulse, Goals, Awareness, Clarity). All subscales are scored so that higher values reflect greater difficulty with emotion regulation (scores range from 3 to 15 for each sub scale). Items within sub scales are summed, as are the sub scales themselves to create a total score which can range from 18 to 90.</description>

    <measure>Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks and 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate how frequently they experience episodes of mindless behavior via the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A). The MAAS-A is a 15-item measure of dispositional mindfulness. Participants respond to statements on a scale from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). Items are summed with scores ranging from 15 to 90, with higher scores representing higher levels of mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 weeks and 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Go No Go Task examines inhibitory control via a computerized program. Participants are instructed to press a button when a certain image is shown on the screen (e.g., a green rectangle, a cross). They are instructed not to respond when another image is shown on the screen (e.g., a blue rectangle, an X). Poor inhibitory control is evident by more failures to inhibit responses in the &quot;no go&quot; condition.</description>

    <description>The mindfulness intervention consists of 6 weekly sessions, blending material from the evidence-based Learning to BREATHE and Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training manualized interventions. Sessions will focus on: experiential mindfulness exercises, such as mindful eating, loving kindness practices, breath awareness, and mindful movement; hunger and satiety awareness; improving responses to emotions; practicing acceptance and being non-judgmental; and tolerating negative feelings and sensations, including those related to hunger and cravings. Participants will be assigned brief homework exercises (approximately 10 minutes) daily in between appointments.Participants in this arm will also receive the usual care provided by the weight management clinic.</description>
