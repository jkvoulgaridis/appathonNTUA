  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PURPOSE:The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of mouth-opening training with
      follow-up telephone calls for reducing postoperative trismus in patients with oral cancer.

      METHODS:The study is a randomized clinical trial using repeated measures. Sixty-eight
      patients admitted at a general hospital in Taiwan for oral cancer surgery were recruited and
      randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. All subjects were instructed
      to practice mouth-opening exercises three times a day every day for three months. Subjects in
      the intervention group received additional 6 follow-up phone calls to enhance mouth-opening
      exercise adherence. Data on maximum interincisal opening and mandibular function impairment
      were collected before surgery, at one-month, and three-months after discharge, using the
      TheraBite Range-of-Motion scale and Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire.

      The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of mouth-opening exercise training
      with follow-up telephone calls for preventing postoperative trismus in patients with oral
      cancer. The specific aims were to test the intervention effects on enhancing mouth-opening
      exercise practice, MIO, and mandibular function. We hypothesized that the intervention group
      would show 1) better adherence to mouth-opening exercises, 2) greater MIO, and 3) better
      mandibular function over time, compared to the control group.

      The study is a randomized clinical trial using repeated measures. A convenience sample of 68
      oral cancer patients was recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention or
      control group according to a list generated by the Random Allocation Software. Subjects in
      both groups received two 30-minute individual trainings on the mouth-opening exercises before
      discharge from the hospital. Subjects were instructed to practice the mouth-opening exercises
      three times a day, every day, for 12 weeks. Subjects in the intervention group received
      additional 6 follow-up phone calls (at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12-week after discharge) from the
      interventionist to enhance mouth-opening exercise adherence. Data on MIO and mandibular
      function impairment were collected before surgery, at one-month, and three-months after
      discharge, using the TheraBite Range-of-Motion scale and the Mandibular Function Impairment
      Questionnaire. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of the hospital where
      the data were collected.

      All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS statistical package version 20.0
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Characteristics of the subjects were summarized by
      percentages, means, and standard deviations (SDs). Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests
      and two independent samples t-tests were used to examine group baseline equivalency. Value
      changes of study outcomes (MIO and mandibular function impairment) and mouth-opening
      exercises performed from T1, T2, to T3 were expressed in two study groups. A general linear
      model was used to model these outcomes as a function of main group effect and main time
      effect. An interaction term (group difference by time) was added into each model to
      investigate the synergistic effect of the intervention with time. Both the stability analysis
      and the analysis of repeated relationships were performed by generalized estimation equations
      (GEE).

    <description>The TheraBite Range-of-Motion Scale was used to measure MIO with the patient in an upright position. MIO was measured as the maximal vertical distance between the edges of the incisors of the maxilla and the mandible. Subjects with MIO &lt;35 mm were considered to have trismus.</description>

    <measure>Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MFIQ was used to measure the extent of patients' mandibular function impairment. The questionnaire consists of 17 items, each of which targets a specific oral function impairment; including difficulties in social activity, speech, taking a large bite, chewing hard food, chewing soft food, work and/or daily activities, drinking, laughing, chewing resistant food, yawning, kissing, and eating different types of food. The subjects were asked to indicate how much difficulty they had with each activity or with eating each type of food using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no difficulty, 4 = very difficult or impossible without help). The total score of the 17 items divided by 68 provides the scale score, with a possible range of 0 to 1. A higher score indicates greater severity of the mandibular function impairment. A score â‰¤0.3, between 0.3 and 0.6, and &gt;0.6 indicates mild, moderate, and severe mandibular function impairment, respectively.</description>
