  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients' selection thorough the identification of predictive factors still represent a
      challenge in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Cetuximab (Erbitux®), a chimeric monoclonal
      antibody binding to the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), belongs to the
      Immunoglobulins (Ig) grade 1 subclass able to elicit both in vitro and in vivo the
      Antibody-Dependent Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC is the cytotoxic killing of
      antibody-coated target cells by immunologic effectors. The effector cells express a receptor
      for the Fc portion of these antibodies (FcγR); genetic polymorphisms of FcγR modify the
      binding affinity with the Fc of IgG1 (Immunoglobulins Gamma subclass 1). Interestingly, the
      high-affinity FcγRIIIa (FcγR type IIIa) V/V is associated with increased ADCC in vitro and in
      vivo. Thus, ADCC could partially account for cetuximab activity. CIFRA is a single arm,
      open-label, phase II study assessing the activity of cetuximab in combination with irinotecan
      and fluorouracile in FcγRIIIa V/V patients with KRAS (Kirsten RAt Sarcoma), NRAS
      (Neuroblastoma Rat Sarcoma), BRAF (B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma) wild type mCRC. The
      study is designed with a two-stage Simon model based on a hypothetical higher response rate
      (+10%) of FcγRIIIa V/V patients as compared to previous trials (about 60%) assuming ADCC as
      one of the mechanisms of cetuximab action. The test power is 95%, the alpha value of the
      I-type error is 5%. With these assumptions the sample for passing the first stage is 14
      patients with &gt;6 responses and the final sample is 34 patients with &gt;18 responses to draw
      positive conclusions. Secondary objectives include toxicity, responses' duration,
      progression-free and overall survival. Furthermore, an associated translational study will
      assess the patients' cetuximab-mediated ADCC and characterize the tumor microenvironment.

      The CIFRA study will determine whether ADCC contributes to cetuximab activity in mCRC
      patients selected on an innovative immunological screening. Data from the translational study
      will support results'interpretation as well as provide new insights in host-tumor
      interactions and cetuximab activity.

    <description>To study cetuximab-mediated ADCC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients will be isolated, and added in the presence of cetuximab to colorectal cancer cells. The specific cytolysis will be evaluated by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and the percentage of lysis will be calculated using the following formula: Cytotoxicity (%) = [1 − (mean test optical density/mean optical density target)] × 100.</description>

    <description>The primary tissues, and metastases when available, will be characterized for the presence of tumor-infiltrating M1 and M2 macrophages and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry through the expression of CD163 (ab182422, Abcam), TGF-β (Tumor Growth Factor beta) (ab92486, Abcam), Arginase-1 (GTX113131, Genetex), Osteopontin (ab218237, Abcam], and PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) (E1L3N®, XP®). M1 infiltrating macrophages will be detected through the following antibodies: CD86 (Cluster of Differentiation 86) (ab53004, Abcam), iNOS (inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase) (ab115819, Abcam), IFN-γ (InterFeroN-gamma) (ab218426, Abcam), TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) (ab1793, Abcam). Natural Killer (NK) and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) will be characterized as follows: NKP46+ (Clone 195314, R&amp;D system), granzyme B (ab134933, Abcam), Foxp3+ (ab20034, Abcam). Results will be expressed for any type of cells in percentages (numerical proportions of stained cells).</description>
