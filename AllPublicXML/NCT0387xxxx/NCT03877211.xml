  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to take into account channel interaction in the cochlear implant
      (CI) fitting process. Designing a fast and accurate method of measurement would help to
      customize the fitting procedures to patients' specificities in order to maximize speech
      understanding in every day conditions especially in noise.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sound masking threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of channel interaction by establishing psychophysical tuning curves in forward masking. Sounds of variable center frequency are used as a masker, and a tone with a fixed frequency at a fixed level is the target. What is tested here is the level of masker that just masks the target.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrically-evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (eABR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Channel interaction assessment using eABRs (auditory nerve responses). The method consists of two measurements: 1) eABR measurements with stimulation by a single electrode of the cochlear implant at 70% of the dynamic range (four different electrodes are tested); 2) Measurement of a single eABR with stimulation from all four electrodes at 70% of the dynamic range. A comparison of the eABRs obtained by these two measurements, indicates the electrical and neural interactions between the electrodes.</description>
