  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have demonstrated that social software could improve warfarin therapy
      quality by Human management. however,the efficiency of management will decline if patients'
      number expands huge. So it is needed that a human-like and automatic management tool could
      replace the human work. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether an AI-based social
      software management model could replace human to guide warfarin therapy.

      1. The investigators have developed an AI-based miniprogram, and embedded in the Wechat
           social application.

        2. The investigators invited patients receiving warfarin therapy to participant this
           randomized controlled trial .

        3. Participants were randomized to the experimental group and control group in a ratio of
           1:1.

        4. Participants' warfarin therapy were managed by an AI-based social miniprogram and a
           Human-based social miniprogram respectively.

        5. International normalized ratio(INR) was monitored once a month at least, and the time in
           therapeutic range was calculated to evaluate the warfarin anticoagulation quality.

        6. Participants were followed-up for 24 months, and clinical events, including major
           bleedings and thrombotic events were recorded during follow-up.
