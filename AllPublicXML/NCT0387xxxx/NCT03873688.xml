  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by recurrent
      airway infections, affecting many systems including lung, pancreas and sweat glands. Cough is
      an important defense mechanism for clearing the secretions that increase in respiratory
      diseases. There have been studies investigating the effect of expiratory muscle training on
      disease groups such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, parkinson's
      disease, and the elderly and healthy individuals. Studies that evaluating effects of
      expiratory muscle training in cystic fibrosis are limited in the literature. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the effect of cough strength in children and adolescents with CF and
      the effect of expiratory muscle training program on cough strength, exercise capacity,
      respiratory muscle strength and quality of life.

    <description>The intensity of training will been determined after assessment of maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). The first training session will perform under the supervision of a physiotherapist, patients will perform training at home. MEP measurement will reevaluate every two weeks and the intensity of training will set according to MEP levels.</description>
