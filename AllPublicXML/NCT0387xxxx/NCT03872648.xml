  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trans (i.e., transgender, transsexual) individuals experience a gender that does not match
      their sex assigned at birth (Gender Incongruence), which can lead to distress called gender
      dysphoria (formerly known as transsexualism). Trans health care (THC) is primarily focusing
      on transition-related medical interventions (e.g. genital surgery) to reduce gender dysphoria
      and improve the quality of life. To date, trans individuals access THC services in both
      decentralized (e.g., various transition-related interventions are spread over several
      locations) and centralized structures (e.g., gender affirmative medical treatments are
      provided by a single source). The TransCare study examines genital surgery for trans women
      (e.g. penile inversion vaginoplasty), focusing on the effect of different health care
      delivery settings (e.g., if patients received all treatments from a single source or spread
      over several locations) on psychosocial outcomes and the quality of healthcare.

    <measure>Gender Dysphoria (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Gender Dysphoria to the point of time after penile inversion vaginoplasty (Baseline + 6 months) and to the 12 month post-procedure time point (Long-term-follow-up, Baseline +18 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Gender Dysphoria is measured using the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS; Kozee et al., 2012).
The total scale score is calculated by averaging the responses of the items.
Scaling: 1 (strongly disagree), 2 (somewhat disagree), 3 (neither agree nor disagree), 4 (somewhat agree); 5 (strongly agree)

    <description>Gender Dysphoria is measured using the Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS; Jones et al., 2018). A higher score indicates a more positive outcome.
