  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized (in 3:1 ratio -vaccine : placebo) study to assess the
      safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity in healthy, BCG vaccinated adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized in two groups (in 3:1 ratio -vaccine : placebo) to receive
      two doses of either GamTBvac or placebo. Subjects will be followed for 5 months after dose 1.

      The primary goal of this study is to assess the immunogenicity of a tuberculosis subunit
      recombinant GamTBvac vaccine in a vaccination scheme with double administration to healthy
      volunteers.

      The secondary goal of this study is the in-depth assessment of the safety and reactogenicity
      of the tuberculosis subunit recombinant vaccine GamTBvac when given twice to healthy
      volunteers.
