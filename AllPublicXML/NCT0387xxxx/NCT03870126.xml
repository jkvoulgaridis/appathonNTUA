    <time_frame>Baseline and 60 min post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in subjective measures of mental alertness and mental fatigue through computer administered cognitive test battery domains of short-term memory, attention and mood. Tasks are word presentation, word recognition, picture presentation, picture recognition, Cognitive Demand Battery (CDB) serial 3 and serial 7 subtraction, and Bakan task/Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP). Performance measures: % correct, % errors and response time in milliseconds.</description>

    <time_frame>After each of 10 1-minute high intensity cycling intervals separated by 1 min rest and at end of exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective categorical scale, score range 1-7, higher score indicates greater alertness meaning a greater feeling of energy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effort</measure>
    <time_frame>After each of 10 1-minute high intensity cycling intervals separated by 1 min rest and at end of exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective categorical scale, Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) measures perception of effort, score range 6-20. Higher score indicates greater effort. 17 or greater generally indicates maximal effort</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps muscle pain</measure>
    <time_frame>After each of 10 1-minute high intensity cycling intervals separated by 1 min rest and at end of exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective categorical scale with ratio-like properties, scale 0-10 with open-ended option for ratings greater than but proportional to 10. Higher scores indicate greater perception of pain in the quadriceps</description>
