  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of attending a SHARE model communication course by
      emergency physicians on patient notification and signing of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders
      for critical patients in the emergency room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An observation form designed based on the SHARE model was completed by two observers who
      noted the communication process between physicians and patients and family members during
      patient notification and signing a DNR order. To assess the influence of physicians attending
      a SHARE model course on the signing of DNR orders, a propensity score-matched population was
      created to reduce the potential selection bias of patients and family members.
