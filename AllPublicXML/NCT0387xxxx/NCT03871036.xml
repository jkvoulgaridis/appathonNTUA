    <textblock>
      This trial will include metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who progressed during or
      after treatment with anti-PD(L)1 therapy and have been treated by a platinum-containing
      regimen, or are cisplatin-ineligible. Patients will receive either paclitaxel in combination
      with durvalumab (anti-PDL-1) and a standard dose (75 mg) of tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4), or
      paclitaxel with only a high dose of tremelimumab (750 mg). Tremelimumab (750 mg), without
      paclitaxel will be used as a comparison arm.

      A run-in safety phase will be followed by a non-comparative 3-arm randomized study with a
      Simon's 2-stage optimal design.

      This trial will include metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who progressed during or
      after treatment with anti-PD(L)1 therapy and have been treated by a platinum-containing
      regimen, or are cisplatin-ineligible.

      A run-in safety phase will be followed by a non-comparative 3-arm randomized study with a
      Simon's 2-stage optimal design.

      Screening:

      Before enrollment, patients will need to complete the following screening procedures (among
      other assessments):

        -  Baseline evaluation by CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (&lt;4 weeks)

        -  Laboratory assessment

        -  Tissue biopsy (in at least 6 patients per arm)

      Run-in phase-1 (R1): n=3 patients will be treated with:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45

      Run-in phase-2 (R2): n=3 patients will be treated with:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 225 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45

      Run-in phase-3 (R3): n=2 x 3 patients will be randomized over 2 arms:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45 OR

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-5

        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)

      Enrollment will start with the first run-in cohort (R1) and will be halted after inclusion of
      the 3rd patient, until 60 days after start of treatment of this patient. Stopping rules are
      defined in the section 6.3 of the study protocol. In case unexpected toxicity occurs (either
      as defined by the stopping rules or otherwise unexpected severe toxicity), the study team
      will discuss whether expansion to include 3 additional subjects is warranted. If no
      unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the 3rd
      patient of R1, enrollment for R2 will begin in a similar fashion. If 2 or more
      nonhematological toxicities occur in R1 or R2, enrollment will be suspended until further
      notice. After this advice, the sponsor will decide on continuation.

      If no unexpected toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the
      3rd patient of R2, the study will continue with a run-in phase-3 (R3) where patients will be
      randomized over 2 arms, n=3 per arm. For each of the treatment arms, if no unexpected
      toxicity has occurred within 60 days after initiation of treatment of the 3rd patient, this
      arm will be continued into the main study phase. If unacceptable toxicity is observed at
      either 225 mg or 750 mg of tremelimumab during one of the run-in doses, a lower dose level
      can be used in the main study.

      Main study:

      Arm A:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-6 and then every 12 weeks until week 45

      Arm B:

        -  paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 of cycles 1-6

        -  tremelimumab 75 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-5

        -  durvalumab 1500 mg on day 1 of cycles 2-12, every four weeks (until week 49)

      Arm C (control arm):

      • tremelimumab 750 mg on day 1 of cycles 1-5 and then every 12 weeks until week 41

      Enrollment will be halted when 12 patients are enrolled in each arm; this will include
      patients treated in R3 at the dose level used in the main study. These patients will be
      included in the efficacy analysis.

      After the last patient has had the second evaluation scan, the Objective Response Rate (ORR)
      of each treatment arm will be evaluated. If one or more of the experimental arms has ≥2
      responses, the study team will discuss continuation of one of the experimental arms to n=20
      with the IDMC. In case 2 responses are seen in one of the arms prior to the second evaluation
      scan of the last patient, a decision on expansion of that arm may be recommended earlier.

      Translational research:

      Baseline and on-treatment biopsies of a metastatic site are done, aiming for at least 6
      patients per arm. A biobank will be created to study the effects of combined tremelimumab +/-
      paclitaxel +/- durvalumab on the Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) consisting of the following
      specimens:

        -  Archival tissue that has been collected before study enrollment

        -  Baseline and on-treatment biopsies (0, 9 weeks)

        -  PBMCs at baseline and on-treatment (0, 5, 9 and 13 weeks)

        -  Serum at baseline and on-treatment (0, 5, 9, 13, 25, 49 weeks)

      Cytotoxic T-cell infiltration to support continued enrollment of one of the experimental arms
      will be determined by CD8+ T-cell immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence and
      subsequent evaluation by a trained pathologist. Tumors showing CD8+ T-cell infiltration will
      be compared between baseline and on-treatment tissue.

      Obtain a comprehensive overview of changes in the tumor micro-environment upon treatment with
      paclitaxel +/- tremelimumab +/- durvalumab.

      Using the samples described above an overview of the TME will be obtained by using primarily
      multiplex immunofluorescence and RNA expression analysis. Changes observed in this way will
      be correlated to clinical response and outcome and new parameters will be identified that
      help to predict response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy for future studies.

             tremelimumab combination therapy.

         20. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug
             excipients.

         21. Prior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab and/or tremelimumab clinical
             study regardless of treatment arm assignment.

         22. Previous treatment with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy.

         23. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IP or any excipient. Procedures for withdrawal of
             incorrectly enrolled patients are presented in Section 4.3 of the clinical protocol.
             If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then that specific
             enrollment/randomization code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be
             replaced.
