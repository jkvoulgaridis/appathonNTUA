      This study determined the effect of 7 days of high-fat overfeeding on whole-body glycaemic
      control, glucose kinetics, skeletal muscle insulin signalling, and markers of skeletal muscle
      microvascular function in 15 healthy young individuals.

    <textblock>
      Fifteen healthy, young individuals underwent metabolic testing before and after 7 days of
      high-fat overfeeding. We determined whole-body glycaemic control, glucose kinetics, skeletal
      muscle insulin signalling, and markers of skeletal muscle microvascular function. Stable
      isotope tracers were used to assess the rate of appearance of glucose from the gut, liver
      glucose output and whole-body glucose disposal. Insulin signalling was determined by Western
      blotting of skeletal muscle tissue. Microvascular function was assessed through the use of
      quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy. These measurements were performed both
      postabsorptively and following the ingestion of 50 grams of glucose + 15 grams of protein.
