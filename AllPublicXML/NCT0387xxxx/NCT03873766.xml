  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no high-quality evidence comparing the clinical outcomes and cost
      effectiveness of surgical drainage combined with antibiotics versus dual-agent intrapleural
      fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) catheter drainage of pleural space infections with concomitant
      antibiotic therapy. The absence of comparative data is a challenge for surgical and medical
      services in clinical decision-making for this common and morbid condition.

      This is a pilot study comparing surgical drainage of the pleural space in complex pleural
      effusions to bedside chest tube drainage using dual agent IPFT with the intent to inform on
      study algorithm and endpoint performance in anticipation of a multi-institutional randomized
      clinical trial.

      Currently, there is no high-quality evidence comparing the clinical outcomes and cost
      effectiveness of surgical drainage combined with antibiotics versus dual-agent intrapleural
      fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) catheter drainage of pleural space infections with concomitant
      antibiotic therapy. The absence of comparative data is a challenge for surgical and medical
      services in clinical decision-making for this common and morbid condition.

      This is a pilot study comparing surgical drainage of the pleural space in complex pleural
      effusions to bedside chest tube drainage using dual agent IPFT with the intent to inform on
      study algorithm and endpoint performance in anticipation of a multi-institutional randomized
      clinical trial.

      Patient's with complex pleural space infections identified at the institution that meet
      inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either IPFT or surgical debridement after a
      surgery consultation is obtained. Patients randomized to the IPFT study arm will receive a
      total of 5-6 doses of alteplase 10mg and DNase 5 mg BID x 3 days delivered through a chest
      tube or small bore catheter into the pleural space. The doses will be given twice a day. If
      the first IPFT dose is given in the evening on the first day, they will only receive a total
      of 5 doses of the dual-agent IPFT (alteplase and DNase). The surgical arm will have either
      open surgery of a VATS approach at the discretion of the surgeon.

      IPFT (alteplase and DNase) is not an investigational agent. It is used in standard of care
      practice for the treatment of complex pleural space infections. The investigators seek to
      compare dual-agent IPFT (alteplase and DNase) to surgery in this study. As such, the IPFT
      agents will be ordered from pharmacy through the electronic medical record (EMR) as in normal
      practice and there is not a study drug.

      After drainage, patients will be followed with protocol images to assess the drainage of
      their pleural space. If there is satisfactory improvement in the pleural fluid collection on
      imaging chest tube or small bore catheter will be removed per protocol in both study arms.
      Chest tube removal protocol is based on fluid character and measured output.

    <description>Imaging will be posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral chest x-ray to determine radiographic change. Images will be saved and exported as JPEG files and opened in image editing software. Polygons will be drawn representing fluid collections and the hemithorax area covered will be calculated with the volume derived.
Change in fluid volume will be quantified as:
Less than 50%
Between 50-75%
Greater than 75% Change of greater than 75% will be considered satisfactory improvement. Chest radiograph images will be reviewed and measured by two independent radiologists. If greater than 5% discrepancy in fluid volume change is reported, the independent radiologists will re-read and re-measure the images together.</description>

Treatment failures will be treated at the discretion of the clinically responsible team, this may include but is not limited to study arm crossover.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured at 30 day and 90 day clinical follow-up using the SF-36 quality of life survey. The SF-36 is a 36 question survey that assesses survey general health on a scale of 1-5 (1=excellent, 5=poor). In addition it assesses how current health limits activities such as walking, daily activities of bathing and dressing oneself. A higher score defines a more favorable health state. Each item is score on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Secondarily, the scores to each question are averaged in the groups in which they are categorized to create an 8 scale scores. The 8 scale categories are: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health.</description>

Cost data will be obtained from billing data from the patient's hospital admission for stay and procedures related to the patients complicated pleural space infection. No billing data will be obtained directly from the participants in the study.</description>

    <description>All patients in the study must have tube thoracostomy for drainage of the pleural space. This may have been done by the clinically responsible team or by the study team. Physicians may select chest tubes of any type, but the minimum size is 14 French. For patency, chest tubes 14-20 French should be kept at negative 20 suction and flushed daily. Large bore chest tubes (&gt;20French) may be kept at negative 20 suction at the discretion of the physician managing the chest tube and do not require daily flushing. Supportive care will follow Institutional Guidelines.</description>

    <description>Once the chest tube is placed, imaging is obtained within 24-48 hours to assess the fluid drainage. The choice of image, either Chest X-ray or CT Chest, is up to the discretion of the treating physician. Based on the imaging, patients will be separated into 2 groups:
A: Complete drainage/re-expansion of the lung: If there is complete drainage of the pleural fluid collection and lung re-expansion based on image #1, patients will follow usual clinical care without randomization and be observed until discharge. Patients will remain in the study and their data will be collected.
B: Incomplete drainage/incomplete lung re-expansion: For those patients that have incomplete drainage of the pleural fluid collection on image #1 and/or the lung does not re-expand.</description>

    <description>A thoracic surgery consultation will be obtained on all patients with incomplete drainage and/or the lung does not re-expand, to determine surgical candidacy. Those patients that the surgical team deem unsafe for surgery will receive clinically appropriate guideline centered, non-surgical, care. These patients will not be randomized but they will remain in the study and their data will be collected. Criteria deeming patients unfit for surgery include, but are not limited to: inability to tolerate single lung ventilation, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and risk of surgery prohibitive. Patients not excluded from surgery will be randomized.</description>
