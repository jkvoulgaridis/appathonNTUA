  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center cross-sectional retrospective study with a quantitative and
      qualitative approach (phase 1 and 2). In phase 1 an online survey will be realized and
      targets male cancer survivors. Phase 2 will take a qualitative approach, in which information
      about patient's experiences, needs and helpful support will be collected by establishing
      focus groups of cancer patients who had been diagnosed during the reproductive age.

      In the end, the results of this study will be integrated into the development of an online
      support tool concerning Fertility Preservation (FP).

        Cancer patients who are/were possible candidates for FP (patients with fertility
        compromising cancer treatment) will be invited to participate. Eligible patients will be
        approached by their former or current treating oncologist, urologist or specialist in
        reproductive medicine.
