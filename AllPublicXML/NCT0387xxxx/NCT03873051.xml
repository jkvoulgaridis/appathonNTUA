  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Developing Real Incentives and Volition for Exercise (DRIVE) Project
      is to evaluate whether matching an intervention to individual differences in motivation (high
      autonomous vs high controlled) is a feasible strategy for engaging African American women in
      greater total physical activity (PA). The DRIVE Project will develop and evaluate two novel
      interventions: 1) a challenge-focused program that targets greater PA enjoyment, PA
      valuation, and relatedness through team-based activities, behavioral skills, and a positive
      social climate; and 2) a rewards-focused program that targets greater PA competency and
      relatedness through financial incentives, behavioral skills, and structured social support.
      To this end, the investigators will be implementing a randomized pilot study at a community
      center. It is hypothesized that participants who receive an intervention that is matched to
      their motivation for PA initiation (High Autonomous &amp; Challenge-Focused; High Controlled &amp;
      Rewards-Focused) will demonstrate greater improvements from baseline to post- in total
      physical activity than those who receive an unmatched intervention (High Autonomous &amp;
      Rewards-Focused; High Controlled &amp; Challenge-Focused). The DRIVE project will provide
      proof-of-concept for the feasibility and usefulness of developing motivationally-targeted
      intervention programs for engaging African American women in greater PA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although engaging in regular physical activity (PA) plays a critical role in reducing one's
      risk for numerous health problems, 4 out of 5 U.S. adults fail to meet national PA
      guidelines, with underserved groups (low income and racial/ethnic minority groups) having the
      highest rates of physical inactivity. Developing innovative strategies to motivate
      underserved groups to initiate PA has become an increasing national priority, but many
      implementation challenges remain, as evidenced by relatively low levels of program engagement
      among underserved groups. Increasingly, researchers have begun to show that rather than using
      a &quot;one-size-fits all&quot; intervention approach, developing interventions that target specific
      individual differences in cultural or social-cognitive factors is a highly effective approach
      for increasing engagement among underserved groups. Broadening this approach in a novel
      domain, the proposed research tests whether developing interventions that target differences
      in autonomous (internally-driven) vs. controlled (externally-driven) motivation is a feasible
      and useful approach for engaging African American women in PA initiation. The proposed study
      is a randomized pilot study comparing two intervention programs: a Challenge-focused program
      targeted toward high autonomous motivation and a Rewards-focused program targeted toward high
      controlled motivation. The Challenge-focused program targets greater PA enjoyment, PA
      valuation, and relatedness, and the Rewards-focused program targets greater PA competence and
      structured social support for PA. It is hypothesized that baseline motivation (measured with
      the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise questionnaire) will moderate treatment effects.
      Specifically, participants with relatively higher autonomous motivation will demonstrate
      greater improvements from baseline to post- in total physical activity when they receive the
      &quot;matched&quot; intervention (Challenge-Focused program) relative to the non-matched intervention
      (Rewards-Focused Program). Additionally, participants with relatively higher controlled
      motivation will demonstrate greater improvements from baseline to post- in total physical
      activity when they receive the &quot;matched&quot; intervention (Rewards-Focused program) relative to
      the non-matched intervention (Challenge-Focused Program). The results of this study will
      provide support of the feasibility and proof-of-concept for conducting a large scale
      randomized controlled trial.

    <intervention_model_description>The randomized pilot study compares the effects of receiving a matched (Autonomous &amp; Challenge-Focused; Controlled &amp; Rewards-Focused) versus an non-matched (Autonomous &amp; Rewards-Focused; Controlled &amp; Challenge -Focused) group-based PA intervention program over an 8-week time period. Randomization to the Rewards- or Challenge-focused intervention is stratified by degree of autonomous motivation (low, medium, high). A total of 150 African American women will be randomly assigned to either receive the Rewards- or the Challenge-focused intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Average minutes of total physical activity (PA) per day; Objective assessments of total PA will be obtained with omni- directional accelerometers. Participants will wear the monitor affixed by an elastic belt over the right hip for 7 consecutive days during baseline and post-intervention (2 months). Consistent with previous studies, a valid day will consist of 10 hours of wear time, and 60 consecutive zeros will indicate non-wear with the allowance of up to 2 minutes under the count threshold for sedentary activity. Data reduction will use previously established accelerometer cut-points (Light PA: 100-1534, MVPA &gt; = 1535), which will be summed to calculate total PA.</description>
