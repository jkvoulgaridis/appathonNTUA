    <textblock>
      This trial will examine the effects of the intervention on changes in dietary quality and
      blood pressure among men and women with high blood pressure, using the new blood pressure
      guidelines for non-pharmacological treatment. The primary outcome is 6-month change in DASH
      (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) adherence, as measured by 24-hour recalls. DASH
      adherence will be measured at 12-months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include
      changes in blood pressure and other physiological outcomes (e.g. weight, lipids, glucose).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 100 million Americans suffer from high blood pressure and thus are at increased risk for
      cardiovascular disease and premature morality. Evidence supports the DASH (Dietary Approaches
      to Stop Hypertension) dietary pattern to reduce blood pressure. DASH is rich in fruits and
      vegetables, legumes, lean protein, and low-fat dairy, and reduced in red meats, sweets and
      processed foods. In the past 20 years, numerous trials have demonstrated the blood
      pressure-lowering effects of DASH across a diverse range of populations. As such, DASH is
      part of national dietary and blood pressure guidelines. Despite this strong evidence, fewer
      than 1% of U.S. adults with high blood pressure fully meet DASH guidelines. Like most
      efficacious interventions, the rate-limiting step involves dissemination. Behavioral trials
      testing DASH have been delivered primarily in-person, an approach that is effective but not
      accessible to the broader population. Innovative and accessible strategies to disseminate
      DASH, such as digital health, are critically needed. To address this need, a feasibility of a
      3-month digital health intervention called DASH Cloud was developed and tested. The DASH
      Cloud intervention asked participants to track their diet daily using a commonly-used
      commercial tracking app with an extensive nutrient database. The intervention technology
      platform extracted food and nutrient data from the app using an application programming
      interface (API). Each day, using this API software, the intervention compared individual
      participant's nutrient intake to the recommended levels in the DASH diet and then processed
      the data against an algorithm and sent automated text messages to each participant with
      information on DASH diet adherence and diet tips. Results indicated that individuals with
      elevated blood pressure were successfully recruited and retained, achieved high engagement
      with daily diet tracking and saw positive changes in diet quality. Based on the results of
      the feasibility trial, this trial will improve upon the personalization of the automated text
      messages and include a scalable and responsive way of delivering coaching, based on diet data
      received in the app. The efficacy of this approach will be tested via a fully-powered
      12-month randomized controlled trial, Nourish. The trial will examine the effects of the
      intervention on changes in dietary quality and blood pressure among men and women with high
      blood pressure, using the new blood pressure guidelines for nonpharmacological treatment. The
      primary outcome is 6-month change in DASH adherence, as measured by 24-hour recalls. This
      trial will also measure DASH adherence at 12-months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes
      include changes in blood pressure and other physiological outcomes (e.g. weight, lipids,
      glucose). The scientific premise of this proposal represents establishing the efficacy of a
      previously-deemed feasible approach for disseminating the DASH diet. With the millions of
      Americans in dire need of nonpharmacological treatments for blood pressure, the public health
      impact of disseminating the Nourish intervention could drastically reduce the incidence of
      cardiovascular disease. The findings from this study prepare for a future implementation
      trial, testing the potential to implement Nourish within clinics and other healthcare
      institutions, yielding a wider dissemination of this evidence-based intervention.
