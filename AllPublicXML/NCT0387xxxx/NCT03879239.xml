      The study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, adaptive design, single blinded,
      placebo-controlled study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vibrant Capsule vs. placebo
      in relieving constipation in subjects with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will come for 4 visits: Screening (visit 1), baseline (visit 2), after 4 treatment
      weeks from baseline (visit 3) and after 8 treatment weeks from baseline (Final visit , visit
      4). A total of 8 treatment weeks

      Three arms will be assessed:

        -  Vibrant Capsule mode A administered 5 times per week

        -  Vibrant Capsule mode B administered 5 times per week

        -  Placebo Capsule administered 5 times per week The difference between the 2 operating
           modes is in the vibrating sequence during the capsule's operating time.
