      The thumb accounts for 50% of the total hand function. This study reports the functional
      outcomes and complications of people with traumatic thumb amputations who underwent
      toe-to-thumb reconstruction.From 2013-01 to 2018-01, 29 patients with second-degree thumb
      defect underwent thumb reconstruction with distal phalangeal braided toenail flap. The
      footscan foot pressure gait analysis system was used to measure the index changes of the same
      foot before and after one, three and six months. The contact area, peak pressure, impulse
      value, contact time of each gait phase, centre of gravity coordinate and foot balance were
      analysed statistically. Twenty-nine cases of thumb reconstruction recovered well. After
      following up for 6-15 months, the appearance of the reconstructed thumb was close to normal,
      and the sensation was restored to S3+. The two-point discrimination was 6-8 mm, and the
      function of the thumb was good. The function of the donor foot was well restored, and no skin
      ulceration, pain and claudication were noted during walking. Compared with that before
      operation, the biomechanical indices of the donor foot were basically restored to normal six
      months after operation. Only the stress and impulse values of the third metatarsal head were
      significantly increased, forming a stress concentration area centred on the third metatarsal
      head.This study confirmed that the toe nail flap with distal phalangeal bone restored the
      second-degree thumb defect without destroying the main functional structure of the sole. The
      biomechanical indices of the donor foot were basically restored to normal six months after
      operation. Only the stress concentration area centred on the third metatarsal head, and the
      pain on the forefoot was induced after the operation. Discomfort, callus formation,
      metatarsal fasciitis, etc. can lead to fatigue fracture of the third metatarsal bone in
      severe cases, which requires further follow-up and observation.

    <description>According to the anatomical region, the plantar was divided into eight stress regions.The increase or decrease of contact area reflects the stress distribution of sole after operation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Its increase indicates that the pressure in the unit area increases when the sole touches the ground.</description>

    <measure>Impulse value</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Impulse value refers to the product of touchdown time and pressure in each stress area of the foot in each cycle. The increase of impulse is more suggestive of fatigue damage and subsequent foot deformities.</description>

        The causes of injury were as follows: 2 cases of amputation and loss, 21 cases of machine
        rolling damage, 5 cases of rotational tear and replantation failure and 1 case of childhood
        traumatic defect. The patients included 19 males and 10 females with age of 17-46 years
        (mean 29.1 years), height of 156-179 cm (average 170.4 cm), weight of 50-80 kg (average
        62.3 kg) and foot length of 23-26 cm (average 24.5 cm). The defect cases included 12 on the
        left side of the toe and 17 on the right side.
