  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a disease that leads to impaired skeletal strength and increased fracture
      risk. Among 200 million osteoporotic patients most are diagnosed only after several
      fractures. Furthermore, the progressively aging population will increase the prevalence of
      osteoporosis. It is estimated that over 75% of osteoporotic patients are not diagnosed and
      does not receive treatment for their condition. Bindex ultrasound device has been developed
      and validated in Caucasian female population. In this study, diagnostic thresholds for
      density index as determined with Bindex will be evaluated in two different ethnic
      populations.

  <detailed_description>

      Currently, the diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the measurement of bone mineral density
      (BMD), using axial dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and/or the lumbar spine
      at special healthcare.

      Application of diagnostic thresholds determined against BMD have been suggested by
      International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) for use with peripheral bone
      densitometry devices (90% sensitivity and 90% specificity). These thresholds have been
      determined and validated for Bindex in Caucasian female population.

      This study focuses on clinical validation of the ultrasound device (BindexÂ®, Bone Index
      Finland Ltd., www.boneindex.com) device and Density Index (DI), a diagnostic parameter
      reported by Bindex. The predetermined thresholds for DI will be evaluated by measuring 70
      osteoporotic and 70 healthy patients with Bindex and DXA in each selected patient groups. The
      feasibility of DI for diagnostics of osteoporosis in these groups will be assessed.
