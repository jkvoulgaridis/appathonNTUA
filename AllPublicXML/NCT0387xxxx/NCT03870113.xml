    <textblock>
      To establish therapeutic dendritic cell (DC) vaccines targeting HPV 16/18 E6/E7 protein to
      block the progression of CIN1/CIN2 to cervical cancer and evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women
      worldwide with 10000 new cases each year in China. The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
      was the major cause of cervical cancer. The oncoproteins E6 and E7 encoded by HPV16 and 18,
      are consistently expressed in HPV-associated Cervical cancer and are responsible for the
      cervical cancer malignant progression. Targeting the E6/E7 proteins could be very helpful to
      regress the CIN 1/2 and block the tumorigenesis.

      By this research, we aim to establish the HPV16/18 E6/E7 peptide library which could induce
      the strong anti-virus immune response and to vaccinate the CIN 1/2 patients with dendritic
      cell vaccines loaded HPV 16/18 E6/E7 epitopes.

      Including:

        1. To create an effective HPV 16/18 E6/E7 antigen peptide library using NetMHCspan software
           based on the MHC-I subtype of the Chinese population and screen E6/E7protein peptides
           with high binding affinity to MHC molecules;

        2. To develop HPV 16/18 E6/E7- pulsed DC vaccines and evaluate the safety and efficacy of
           DC vaccines;

        3. The patients are vaccinated with the HPV16/18 E6/E7- pulsed DC vaccines

        4. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of DC vaccines loaded with HPV 16/18 E6/E7.
