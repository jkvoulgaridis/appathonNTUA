  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The performance of the eLab C-Reactive Protein, Procalcitonin, and Lactate Assays will be
      demonstrated during a method comparison study in which prospectively collected venous whole
      blood and plasma samples are used. eLab results will be compared to an FDA cleared predicate
      device. Demographic information will be collected for the subject. Venous blood will be
      collected in 2 Li-heparinized tubes (2-4ml per tube). One tube will be used for testing at
      the site and the second tube will be processed to plasma for storage and subsequent shipment
      to a designated testing site. Whole blood samples will be tested on the eLab C-Reactive
      Protein, Procalcitonin, and Lactate test as soon as possible after collection; testing on
      whole blood must be completed within 30 minutes of collection. A predicate Lactate test will
      also be run as soon as possible after collection; testing of WB on the predicate must be
      completed within 30 minutes of collection. Plasma will be separated from the whole blood via
      centrifugation within 30 minutes of collection and tested on the eLab C-Reactive Protein,
      Procalcitonin, and Lactate Assays and started on predicate CRP and PCT devices (If available
      at the site) within 30 minutes of the eLab whole blood test. The remainder of the plasma
      specimen and plasma from the second collection tube will be frozen within one hour of
      collection, then stored at approximately -20 degrees C or colder.

    <description>An analysis of the results from 150-200 subjects collected across the three (3) sites will be performed to accomplish the analytical comparison endpoints. If the analysis requires more samples to cover the assay range, then, the study may be continued and more subjects enrolled. A minimum of 25 percent of the samples must have values near the clinical significant concentration. In order to meet this requirement up to 10 % of samples may be spiked. Clinical significant concentrations for CRP are defined as values greater than 10 mg/L; PCT values greater than 0.5 ng/mL and LAC values greater than 2 mmol/L.</description>
