  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases resulting in large burdens on society.

      Among the emerging treatments, Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMC) intra-articular injections are a
      promising regenerative approach. However, they offer only a temporary benefit since they
      target synovial and chondral tissues but fail to address the osteochondral interface, which
      plays a key role in the onset and progression of joint degeneration.

      This project will investigate the efficacy of combined BMC injections, targeting both
      intra-articular tissues and subchondral bone, to treat OA in a Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to evaluate in a RCT the potential of a new combined BMC treatment for OA,
      through the use of scores for the clinical outcome, the study of imaging and biological
      samples for tissue regeneration and systemic effects, and the identification of BMC and
      patient characteristics predictive of better results.

      All patients will undergo an arthroscopic procedure to debride degenerated tissues (this can
      offer a temporary benefit but not long lasting results) before BMC intra-articular injection.
      Half patients will receive also the injection of BMC at the subchondral level (bone samples
      obtained to allow BMC placement will be sent to the Lab).

      The same minimally invasive incisions will be used for all patients, ensuring patient
      blinding. Evaluations, performed by medical staff not involved in the treatment to ensure
      double blinding, will document subjective clinical improvement, functional measurements,
      biomarker study, and imaging with the use of modern 3TMRI and qCT technology. BMC
      characterization and patient features will be analysed to identify factors predictive of a
      better outcome.

    <description>WOMAC is a validated score, designed to highlight the problems of patients with lower limb pathologies, in particular in terms of pain, stiffness and functionality. The score will be completed by the patient, possibly in the presence of an investigator, and simple guidelines for self-compilation will be provided.</description>

    <description>IKDC is a validated score used in the evaluation of symptoms, function and sport activity in patients suffering of knee diseases, such as meniscal or ligamentous damage, osteoarthritis. The Subjective Knee Form provides the best method of overall assessment of the most significant symptoms and disabilities for a population that has undergone cartilage repair treatments.</description>
