  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a coding system
      developed to describe the health status of individuals in a universal way. The increasingly
      common core sets are short forms of ICF categories that are specifically selected for
      diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship among the lower extremity
      orthoses commonly used in children with cerebral palsy (CP), body structure and functions,
      activity and participation level, and is to determine the relationship between clinical tests
      and ICF CP core set. For this purpose, a total of 75 children with ages between 3 and 18 will
      be divided into 3 groups, including using a walking orthosis, using a resting orthosis, and
      using both walking and resting orthoses. Children's muscle tone, joint limitation, gross
      motor functions, balance skills, activity and participation levels and quality of life will
      be assessed with the tests frequently used in the clinic separately and with the core set in
      a holistic framework.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Berg Balance Scale (PBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>PBS is a 14-item scale that assesses children's balance. Each item is scored between 0 and 4 points. As a result, the total score is given, while the low score refers to the poor balance and the high score refers to the good balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM)-88</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Children's motor ability will be assessed to investigate the correlations between the motor functions and orthosis used by child. The GMFM-88 consists of 88 items examining children's gross motor movements. Each item is scored between 0 and 3 points. The higher the child gets, the more successful the child is in gross motor functions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurements of range of motions</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Goniometer will be used to determine the range of motions. So, the investigators will be able to investigate the correlations between orthotic and joints</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>MAS will be used to determine the muscle tone. MAS is a scale that shows muscle hypertone between 0 and 5. 5 means that the joint is rigid due to the increase in excess tonus while 0 means no increase in tonus.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>PedsQL is a quality-of-life questionnaire which evaluates the situations encountered in daily life of children with CP such as dressing, self-care, school activities, speech and eating. Special PedsQL will be used in 4 different age groups, including 3-4 age specific, 5-7 age specific, 8-12 age specific and 13-18 age specific. The number of items in each age group is different, but the result of PedsQL is expressed in%, not total points. A higher score refers to a more independent child.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Functional Independence Measurement (WeeFIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>WeeFIM is an 18-item scale that measures children's activity and participation. It consists of 18 items including self-care, sphincter control, locomotion, memory, etc. Each item is scored between 0 and 7. A higher score refers to a more independent child.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ICF CP Core Set</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CP Core set consists of totally 25 items about body functions, body structure, activity, participation and environmental factors. Each item is scored within 0 to 4 points. 0 indicates that there are no problems.</description>
