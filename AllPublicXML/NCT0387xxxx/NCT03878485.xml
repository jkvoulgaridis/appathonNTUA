  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of the increasing experience with magnetic resonance image-guided radiotherapy
      (MRgRT) and adaptive planning and advances in magnetic resonance (MR)-only planning, the
      investigators propose here to evaluate the feasibility and safety of same-session MR-only
      simulation and treatment with SMART for spinal metastases. Although spine SBRT is a
      standard-of-care treatment modality, this expedited same-session MR-only simulation and
      treatment with SMART workflow is novel. Previously, delivery of spine SBRT has typically
      required several days from time of consultation to simulation and then 1-2 weeks from
      simulation to the initiation of treatment. On this proposed study, patients will not undergo
      computed tomography (CT) simulation and will instead have same-session MR-only simulation and
      treatment planning, on-table, using SMART. In this manner, patients would initiate treatment
      within just several days from the consult. Feasibility of the workflow will be defined as
      successful delivery of the first fraction of same-session MRI-only simulation and treatment
      with SMART on the first on-table attempt for at least 70% of patients. Patients will be
      treated in five fractions over 1-2 weeks. Although the long-term goal will be to achieve a
      significantly shortened time from consult to treatment as compared to traditional
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using simulation, the present study will be driven
      by short-term goals of workflow feasibility and safety.

             radiation oncology evaluation.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) â‰¥ 60.

          -  Deemed medically fit for SBRT by treating physician

          -  Diagnostic CT with images through the projected treatment area within six months prior
             to enrollment.

          -  Diagnostic spinal MRI obtained less than or equal to six weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  At least 18 years of age.
