  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hope to better define the association between opiate use and biliary dilation, which was
      evident in our previous retrospective study. This prospective study including all endoscopic
      ultrasound procedures performed for further evaluation of biliary dilatation in the setting
      of bilirubin &lt;2 mg/dL will enable accurate measurement of common bile duct and pancreatic
      duct diameter using endoscopic ultrasound and identification of other non- obstructive
      factors which may modulate biliary dilation (i.e. age, cholecystectomy status, duration and
      type of opiate used).

      We hope to better define the association between opiate use and biliary dilation, which was

      factors which may modulate biliary dilation (i.e. age, cholecystectomy status, duration and
      type of opiate used).

      We believe this work will be of great interest to gastroenterologists, as it provides
      additional data for interpretation of isolated common bile duct dilation in asymptomatic
      patients.

    <description>Statistical analysis will be conducted to assess for association between opiate use (including type and duration of opiates) and common bile duct diameter. We will also evaluate for other factors predictive of increased common bile duct diameter, which may include age and cholecystectomy status (based on our initial retrospective study). Power calculations to determine sample size were extrapolated from the initial retrospective study at our institution.</description>

        Patients referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or endoscopic retrograde
        cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for further evaluation of abnormal imaging findings will be
        screened for inclusion in this study. Patients with biliary dilatation who meet all the
        inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate
        in this prospective study during their initial clinic visit or hospital consultation.
