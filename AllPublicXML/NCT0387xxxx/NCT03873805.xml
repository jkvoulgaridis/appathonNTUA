      This phase I trial studies side effects and best dose of PSCA-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
      T cells in treating patients with prostate stem cell antigen positive (PSCA+) castration
      resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PSCA-CAR
      T cells are immune cells that have been engineered in the laboratory to kill tumor cells.
      This is done by using a virus to insert a piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the
      immune cells that allows them to recognize prostate tumor cells. It is not yet known how well
      PSCA-CAR T cells works in killing tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration
      resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the safety and tolerability of autologous
      anti-PSCA-CAR-4-1BB/TCRzeta-CD19t-expressing T lymphocytes (PSCA-CAR T cells) in patients
      with PSCA+ metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      II. Define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PSCA-CAR T cells in patients with PSCA+
      mCRPC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the expansion and persistence of PSCA-CAR T cells. II. Assess clinical response
      based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.

      III. Assess survival outcomes (including biochemical progression free survival [PFS],
      radiographic PFS and overall survival [OS]).

      IV. Assess serum cytokine profiles in peripheral blood pre- and post-therapy. V. Describe the
      PSCA expression level on tumor cells prior to CAR T cell infusion, and the relationship it
      may have with disease response and observed toxicities.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the phenotypes and frequencies of immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood
      pre- and post-therapy.

      II. Enumerate and characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) pre- and post-therapy.

      III. Enumerate and analyze gene expression of circulating tumor cells (CTC) pre- and
      post-therapy.

      IV. Analyze circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA). V. Determine the immunogenicity of PSCA-CAR T
      cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients may receive lymphodepleting regimen at the discretion of the treating physician
      including fludarabine intravenously (IV) on days -5 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5
      to -3 or on days -4 and/or -3. Patients then receive autologous
      anti-PSCA-CAR-4-1BB/TCRzeta-CD19t-expressing T lymphocytes IV over 10-15 minutes at day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 1, every 2 days for up
      to 14 days, weekly for up to 1 month, every month for up to 1 year, and then annually for up
      to 15 years.
