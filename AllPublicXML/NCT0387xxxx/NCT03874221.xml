  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With effective anti-retroviral therapy, non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular
      diseases, have become the major cause of morbidity and mortality for people living with HIV.
      There is only limited data evaluating the burden and risk factors of cardiovascular disease
      in the Asian HIV-infected population. Accurate non-invasive tools for prediction of
      cardiovascular disease, particularly in Asian HIV-infected populations, are urgently needed.
      Recently, more detailed evaluation of the complex retinal vasculature has been made feasible
      with advances in digitalized retinal imaging techniques.

      This study aims 1. to determine the prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis and obstructive
      coronary artery disease HIV-infected individuals with one or more cardiovascular disease risk
      factors in Asia. 2. to determine the performance of automatic retinal image analysis (ARIA)
      in predicting the risk of coronary artery disease in HIV-infected individuals, as compared to
      traditional risk prediction tools. Patients will undergo a coronary CT angiogram, followed by
      an automatic retinal image analysis within 4 weeks post completion of CT angiogram.
