      Retrospective analysis of hemoglobin concentrations and red cell transfusion thresholds in
      patients with an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) admitted to an ARDS-center of a
      German university hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion of packed red blood cells is a common procedure in critically ill patients. In
      recent years it has been shown that for many patient populations a restrictive transfusion
      strategy is not inferior compared to a liberal transfusion strategy with regard to overall
      outcome.

      So far it is unclear whether patients with an ARDS should receive blood transfusions
      according to a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy. Besides pulmonary gar exchange
      and cardiac output, the hemoglobin concentration is an important determinant for oxygen
      delivery.

      The aim of this retrospective observational study is to analyze if low levels of hemoglobin/a
      restrictive transfusion strategy and are associated with a different mortality compared to
      higher levels of hemoglobin/a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with an ARDS.

    <description>Observational post-ad-hoc design to compare patients admitted with an ARDS and separated into different groups according to their mean hemoglobin concentration during their stay on the intensive care unit.
Approximately 1000 adult patients admitted from 2007 to 2018 to the Charite ARDS center will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their discharge from the ICU.
