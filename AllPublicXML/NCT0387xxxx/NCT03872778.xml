             highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 6 months after
             study drug discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence

               -  Male or female sterilization

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c)

                    1. Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. In
                       case of use of oral contraception, women should be stable on the same pill
                       for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository. Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study.
                       Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if
                       they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum
                       Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL [for US only: and
                       estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to
                       screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment
                       is she considered not of child bearing potential. Sexually active males must
                       use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 6 months after
                       stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is
                       required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of
                       the drug via seminal fluid.
