  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical investigation plan is a randomized controlled pivotal study with 2
      parallel groups, has a total duration of two years. For the study, 30 pediatric patients
      suffering from acquired brain injury will be recruited at the Scientific institute Eugenio
      Medea.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the clinical benefit of using an ankle
      mobilization device for the rehabilitation of pediatric patients with acquired brain
      injuries, on its clinical performance and its risks, and on its safety.

      The efficacy of the treatment will be evaluated in terms of ankle range of motion (primary
      outcome). The effects of the treatment on musculoskeletal plasticity will be studied using an
      isokinetic machine and functional magnetic resonance imaging will provide information on
      variations of reactivity in the motor cortical network. Ease of use, safety and usability of
      the device will also be evaluated.

    <description>The treatment consists in 20 rehabilitation sessions, 5 times/week for 4 weeks. The device is capable of generating ankle dorsi/plantarflexion movements using two activation modes: passive and assistive. In the passive mode the device generates a movement pattern which the patient follows passively without exerting any force on the device. During the assistive mode, the device follows the active movement of the patient. During the intervention, these two modes will be alternated.</description>
