    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the therapeutic role of rTMS on parkinson's patients with cognitive
      impairment. Patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and cognitive impairment will be
      recruited. All patients will be admitted and will be allocated randomly into two groups one
      of which will receive real sessions of high frequency rTMS for each hemisphere for 10
      consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days with repeated booster sessions every
      month during the period of follow up. The other will receive sham sessions.

      This study aims to assess the therapeutic role of rTMS on parkinson's patients with cognitive
      impairment. Thirty PD patients with cognitive impairment using United Kingdom (UK ) bank
      criteria for PD will be recruited from outpatient clinic in Assiut University. All patients
      will be admitted at Neuropsychiatric Department, Assiut University Hospital/ Assiut,
      Egypt.Each patient fulfilled the inclusion criteria as having score less than 24 on
      Mini-Mental Status Examination will be recruited. The patients will be allocated randomly
      into two groups one of which will receive real sessions of high frequency rTMS (25 HZ), with
      intensity of 80% of resting motor threshold detected from the hand motor area, with total
      2000 pulses for each hemisphere for 10 consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days
      with repeated booster session every month during the period of follow up among three months.
      The other will receive sham sessions. All subjects will be followed up by selected clinical
      rating scales at different intervals pre session, post 10 sessions, and after one, two and
      three months.

    <description>any changes in MMSE along the course of follow up (baseline, post treatment, one, two and three months later). Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (â‰¤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>any changes of Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA)along the course of follow up (baseline, post treatment, one, two and three months later). MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. A score of 26 or over is considered to be normal. In a study, people without cognitive impairment scored an average of 27.4; people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) scored an average of 22.1; people with Alzheimer's disease scored an average of 16.2.</description>

    <description>By defining intensity of 80% of the resting Motor Threshold detected from motor area for Rt Abductor digiti minimi (ADM), we will apply repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) using 70-mm diameter air-cooled figure-of-8 coil and SuperRapid2 Magnetic Stimulator with high frequency (25Hz), Stimuli will be delivered for total 2000 pulse (divided on 50 trains with 40 pulses per train with inter-train interval 30 seconds) for each hemisphere (coil placed tangential over the optimal position of hand motor area detected for Real group and the same coil placed perpendicular with hand of coil pointing upward over occipital cortex for Sham group). Sessions will be consecutive for ten days period with repetition of consecutive 5 sessions as boosting doses on 5 days period over the follow up visits every month for the next 3 months.</description>
