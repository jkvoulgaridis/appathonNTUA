      SELECT 2 evaluates the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy compared to medical
      management alone in acute ischemic stroke patients due to a large vessel occlusion in the
      distal ICA and MCA M1 who have large core on either CT (ASPECTS: 3-5) or advanced perfusion
      imaging ([rCBF&lt;30%] on CTP or [ADC&lt;620] on MRI: ≥50cc) or both and are treated within 0-24
      hours from last known well.

      The second aim is to look at the correlation of imaging profiles with thrombectomy clinical
      outcomes and treatment effect. This will be evaluated by comparing the outcomes in patients
      with discordant imaging profile and assessing if thrombectomy outcome rates and treatment
      effect will differ in patients with discordant imaging profiles (favorable CT/unfavorable
      perfusion imaging and unfavorable CT/favorable perfusion imaging).

      SELECT 2 is a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter, assessor-blinded
      controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of thrombectomy in patients with large
      core on either CT or advanced perfusion imaging treated within 0-24 hours from last known
      well. The secondary aim is to look at the correlation of imaging profiles with thrombectomy
      clinical outcomes and treatment effect.

      Patients with the final diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion
      in the distal ICA and MCA M1 who have large core on either CT (ASPECTS: 3-5) or advanced
      perfusion imaging ([rCBF&lt;30%] on CTP or [ADC&lt;620] on MRI: ≥50cc) or both within 0-24 hrs from
      last known well will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into thrombectomy plus medical management
      vs medical management alone. Patient outcomes will be measured at baseline, 24 hours post,
      discharge, 30 days and 90 days.

      The primary endpoint is the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 (+/- 15) days. The primary
      outcome is a shift on 90-day mRS. The 2nd primary outcome is favorable clinical outcomes: mRS
      score of 0-2. Secondary outcomes are safety outcomes such the incidence of symptomatic
      intracranial hemorrhage (sICH per SITS-MOST) and Imaging endpoints such as infarct volume on
      MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence (or CT if MRI not feasible) 24 to 72 hours
      after randomization. CT images will be read by iSchemaView automated ASPECTS as well as by a
      physician. In cases where there is disagreement, the physician reading will override the
      automated software reading. CT/MR perfusion images with mismatch determination will be read
      by iSchemaView automated RAPID software. All the images will be adjudicated by a blinded core
      lab at the University of Texas-Medical School at Houston.

      A maximum of 560 patients will be randomized across the study sites. Covariate adaptive
      randomization will be used to balance the distribution of important variables. Interim
      analyses will be conducted at 200 and 380 patients, at which time the study may stop for
      efficacy or futility.

    <description>Patients randomized to endovascular thrombectomy arm will receive thrombectomy plus medical management. They will be treated with thrombectomy devices (stent‐retrievers) with/without suction thrombectomy systems currently cleared by the FDA for thrombus removal in patients experiencing an acute stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset. The devices which will be used are the Trevo Retriever, the Solitaire Revascularization Device and EmboTrap Revascularization Device. Stent retrievers will be used as the primary mode of thrombectomy with adjunctive use of the aspiration devices approved by the FDA (MicroVention SOFIA Catheter, and the Penumbra thrombectomy system) permitted in the study.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive standard AHA guideline-directed medical therapy, which will include IV-tPA in patients presenting within the first 3 hours from last-seen-normal and meeting other FDA label criteria. For non-tPA treated patients, this will include aspirin 325 mg on day 1 followed by aspirin 81 mg or 325 mg thereafter, which will be determined by treating physician and standard deep venous thrombosis prevention therapy. Intravenous anticoagulation and dual anti-platelet therapy will be discouraged without clear documented reasoning. Post-tPA patients will be treated based on standard study site protocols for these patients.</description>
