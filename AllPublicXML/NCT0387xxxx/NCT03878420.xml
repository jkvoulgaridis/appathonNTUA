    <textblock>
      This study is a double-masked, sham-controlled, parallel design, prospective multi-site study
      for the use of PBM as a treatment for visual impairment in subjects with dry AMD. The target
      enrollment is 96 subjects in up to 10 centers in Europe, randomized at a 1:2 ratio into 2
      groups: Sham Treatment (S-1) and PBM Treatment (T-2). Once 96 subjects have been enrolled in
      the study, if there are less than 144 eyes that qualify for the study, additional subjects
      will be enrolled until 144 eyes have been included in the study.

      S-1 will receive 3 sham treatments per week over 3 to 5 weeks starting at Baseline and
      starting again at Months 4 and 8. T-2 will receive 3 PBM treatments per week over 3 to 5
      weeks starting at Baseline and starting again at Months 4 and 8. Each treatment series will
      total 9 treatments. Neither the subject nor the study staff will know which treatment the
      subject has been assigned.

      Subjects will receive standard visual outcome measurements including Early Treatment Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA, CSV-1000E contrast sensitivity (CS) and the Radner Reading
      Test prior to and following each treatment series as well as eye exams, fundus photographs,
      Heidelberg OCT and FAF imaging and optional Optos Ultra Wide Field (UWF) imaging of the
      retina at selected time intervals. Subjects will also complete the Visual Function
      Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25) at selected time intervals.

             that they will require cataract surgery in the study eye in the next 24 months.

          -  Posterior capsule opacification, which might interfere with visual acuity or imaging
             in the study eye(s). Subjects should not be entered if there is likelihood that they

             study

          -  Presence of or history of malignancy within the past 5 years other than non-melanoma
