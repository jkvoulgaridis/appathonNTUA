  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a necessary and important step in the development of a new therapy for upper
      limb functional recovery in patients with severe motor impairment. It is the first clinical
      trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or
      rTMS) delivered to excite the undamaged hemisphere (specifically the contralesional higher
      motor cortices or cHMC) in stroke. Therefore, this study will determine whether the positive
      results obtained in our short-term pilot study can be made to last longer and produce
      functional benefits in severe patients with the application of brain stimulation in
      combination with long-term rehabilitation therapy. Rehabilitation therapy administered is
      called contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES). Determining
      whether combining rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces synergistic gains in
      functional abilities in severe patients is necessary for acceptance by the clinical community
      and to move this technology toward commercialization and widespread dissemination. The
      proposed study will determine whether the combination of rTMS facilitating the cHMC with
      CCFES produces greater improvements in upper extremity function in severe participants who
      are ≥6 months from stroke onset than the combination of rTMS facilitating the damaged
      hemisphere (specifically the ipsilesional primary motor cortex, iM1) and CCFES or the
      combination of sham rTMS and CCFES. The secondary purposes are to define which patients
      benefit most from the treatments, which may inform future device and treatment development
      and clinical translation, and to explore what distinct effects the three treatments have on
      the brain. To accomplish these purposes, we are conducting a clinical trial that enrolls
      severe stroke patients.

      Overall Study Design Summary: We propose a 5-yr RCT in which 72 stroke patients who are &gt;6
      months post-stroke are randomized to 12 wks of one of 3 treatments: (1) CCFES + cHMC
      facilitation, (2) CCFES + iM1 facilitation, (3) CCFES + Sham rTMS. The treatment dose will be
      the same for all groups: 10 sessions per week (7.5 hrs) of self-administered CCFES-assisted
      hand opening exercises performed at home plus 2 sessions per week (2.5 hrs) consisting of
      group-specific rTMS and CCFES-mediated functional task practice performed in the laboratory.
      Upper limb impairment, activity limitation, and patient-reported disability will be assessed
      at 0 (baseline), 6, 12 (end of treatment), 24, and 36 wks. Neurophysiology (IHI and
      excitability of uncrossed output) will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 12 (end of treatment),
      and 36 wks, on a separate day from functional motor outcomes assessment. MRI assessment of
      stroke lesion and location, and DTI assessment of corticospinal damage will be performed at
      baseline.

    <intervention_model_description>In a randomized-controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial, an anticipated 72 patients will be assigned to receive 12 weeks of CCFES + cHMC facilitation, or CCFES + iM1 facilitation, or CCFES + sham rTMS. Assessments of upper limb motor function and neurophysiology will be completed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. This study will 1) determine whether cHMC facilitation augments the effects of CCFES to produce greater improvements in upper limb function in severe patients, 2) investigate the underlying neurophysiologic mechanisms contributing to restored paretic limb motor control, and 3) evaluate and identify patient factors that affect efficacy of CCFES + cHMC facilitation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Subjects will be told they will receive brain stimulation, but will be given no indication as to which target will be stimulated. Investigators analyzing functional outcome data, neurophysiology data and MRI data will receive coded data that conceals the identity of the subject. Therapists involved in training patients will not know which type of rTMS the participant receives.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in UEFM will be assessed at at 6 weeks, 12 weeks (end of treatment), 24 weeks, and 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The UEFM is a reliable and valid measure of post-stroke upper limb motor impairment. The UEFM items take into account synergy patterns, isolated strength, coordination, and hypertonia. Volitional movement of the upper limb (shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand) is examined in and out of synergies. Each item is graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; and 2, perform fully) and summed to provide a maximum score of 66. The UEFM is classified as a body structure/function impairment measure on the ICF domain.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neurophysiologic Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in neurophysiologic indices will be measured at 12 weeks (end of treatment) and at 36 weeks, on a separate day from functional motor outcomes assessment.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurophysiologic assessments will be performed using TMS. While patients are seated with forearms resting and supported on a flat surface, a 70mm figure-of-eight coil will be positioned over the scalp at locations corresponding to motor hotspots. Coil placement and targeting will be guided using MRI-stereotaxy, same as with rTMS. Surface EMG electrodes will be attached to paretic and non-paretic EDC (and other muscles, as explained below) to record MEPs and changes in ongoing muscle activity. Inter-hemispheric interactions and excitability of pathways devoted to weak muscles will help characterize role of the intact, contralesional motor cortices.</description>

    <description>This rTMS paradigm is the &quot;New Approach&quot;. Facilitation of the intact hemisphere target (cHMC) will be achieved using 5Hz rTMS. After rTMS, the participant will participate in one hour of CCFES-mediated functional task practice. The therapist will instruct and guide the participants in practicing functional tasks with their paretic hand with the assistance of CCFES. Tasks will involve using the paretic hand to pick up, manipulate, and release objects commonly used in daily life. Early sessions will focus on simpler tasks, such as practicing opening the hand adequately to acquire an object.</description>

    <intervention_name>Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) uses electrical stimulation to open the weak hand. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the participant's affected arm to stimulate the hand muscles, and a special glove is worn on the participant's strong hand and controls the stimulator. When the participant opens the gloved hand, stimulation opens the weak hand; when they close the gloved hand, stimulation turns off and the weak hand relaxes. During the clinic visits, participants will use CCFES to assist hand opening during functional training. During participant home sessions, they will use CCFES to perform hand opening exercise.</description>
