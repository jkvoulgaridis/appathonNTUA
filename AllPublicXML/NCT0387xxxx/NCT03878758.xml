  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a subject partially blinded, block randomized, prospective, single-visit,
      multi-center study to compare user experiences with BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs. three (3)
      thinner commercially available comparator pen needles (Artsana Insupen Extr3me 33G, Artsana
      Insupen Extr3me 34G and the Simple Diagnostics Comfort EZ™ 33G Pen Needles). The study will
      include up to 146 study subjects having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of one 60 to 120 minute visit in which pre-set doses of saline will be
      abdominally delivered by Subjects via a reusable insulin pen device. All pen needles will be
      attached by study staff. The pen needle outer cover and inner shield will be removed prior to
      subject use so that they will not be able to identify which device they are using. Subjects
      are to perform 12 injections into the abdomen (6 pairs of injections). Pairs of injections
      will be evaluated and each pair will contain one BD Nano™ PRO and one comparator pen needle.
      Within the 12 injections, each comparator will be injected twice, therefore each subject will
      experience 2 of each of the following pairs:

      BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs Artsana Insupen Extr3me 4mm x 33G x 2 BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs
      Artsana Insupen Extr3me 3.5mm x 34G x 2 BD Nano™ PRO pen needle vs Simple Diagnostics Comfort
      EZ™ 4mm x 33G Each Subject will evaluate pain after completion of each pair of injections
      using a 15 cm relative Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Injection Site Pain for BD Nano PRO Needle Compared to Each of Three (3) Commercially Available Comparators</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores were collected immediately after each paired injection</time_frame>
    <description>Injection pain as measured by a relative visual analog scale. This endpoint analyzes data for individual groups. User preference is assessed through a single question reported on a 150mm relative VAS scale with the BD Nano™ PRO pen needle Pen labeled at +75 mm and the Comparator pen needle labeled at -75mm. On this scale, zero represents no preference to either pen needle. Relative VAS scores range from -75mm to 75mm; positive scores reflect preference forBD Nano™ PRO and negative scores reflect preference for the comparator.
Scores from each of the paired injections (308 pairs for all participants) were pooled and a mean was calculated. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was calcuated for the average relative rating. A linear model was used to adjust for the order effect.
If the lower bound of the 95% CI is &gt; -10cm, non-inferiority could be concluded. If the lower bound of the 95% CI is &gt;0, superiority can also be concluded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Needle Bending in BD Nano™ PRO vs Each of 3 Comparator Pen Needles</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores were collected immediately after each paired injection</time_frame>
    <description>Participants reported a visual score of needle bending. A score of at least 2, corresponding to &gt;10 degrees of bending, was considered an event of a bent needle. Scores from each injection (308 for each needle type) were pooled and a mean was calculated. The incidence of bent needle events in the BD Nano™ PRO and each competitor were compared and the mean difference reported with a 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Superiority of BD Nano™ PRO vs Each of 3 Comparator Pen Needles (Leakage)</measure>
    <time_frame>Leakage was measured directly after each injection</time_frame>
    <description>After saline delivery equivalent to 30U of U100 insulin (0.3mL) and subject removal of pen needle from body, study staff used the provided materials and scale to absorb leakage from the pen needle tip and injection site to measure the amount of leakage. Leakage over 0.015g was counted as an event. The incidence of leakage (yes/no) was calculated for each groups and the mean difference calculated along with a 95% confidence interval. A positive score indicates fewer leakage events with the BD Nano™ PRO and a negative score indicates fewer leakage events with the competitor. Scores from each injection (308 for each needle type) were pooled and a mean was calculated. The incidence of needle leakage in the BD Nano™ PRO and each comparator were compared and the mean difference reported with a 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare BD Nano™ PRO vs Each of 3 Comparator Pen Needles (Force)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after injection Pair</time_frame>
    <description>Subject perceived force required to deliver dose; measured by a relative 5 point Likert scale. The scale ranged from -2 to 2, where positive scores indicated less thumb force required for the BD Nano™ PRO, and negative scores indicated less thumb force for the comparator. Scores from each of the paired injections were pooled and a mean was calculated.</description>

        <title>Injection Site Pain for BD Nano PRO Needle Compared to Each of Three (3) Commercially Available Comparators</title>
        <description>Injection pain as measured by a relative visual analog scale. This endpoint analyzes data for individual groups. User preference is assessed through a single question reported on a 150mm relative VAS scale with the BD Nano™ PRO pen needle Pen labeled at +75 mm and the Comparator pen needle labeled at -75mm. On this scale, zero represents no preference to either pen needle. Relative VAS scores range from -75mm to 75mm; positive scores reflect preference forBD Nano™ PRO and negative scores reflect preference for the comparator.
Scores from each of the paired injections (308 pairs for all participants) were pooled and a mean was calculated. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was calcuated for the average relative rating. A linear model was used to adjust for the order effect.
If the lower bound of the 95% CI is &gt; -10cm, non-inferiority could be concluded. If the lower bound of the 95% CI is &gt;0, superiority can also be concluded.</description>

        <title>Superiority of BD Nano™ PRO vs Each of 3 Comparator Pen Needles (Leakage)</title>
        <description>After saline delivery equivalent to 30U of U100 insulin (0.3mL) and subject removal of pen needle from body, study staff used the provided materials and scale to absorb leakage from the pen needle tip and injection site to measure the amount of leakage. Leakage over 0.015g was counted as an event. The incidence of leakage (yes/no) was calculated for each groups and the mean difference calculated along with a 95% confidence interval. A positive score indicates fewer leakage events with the BD Nano™ PRO and a negative score indicates fewer leakage events with the competitor. Scores from each injection (308 for each needle type) were pooled and a mean was calculated. The incidence of needle leakage in the BD Nano™ PRO and each comparator were compared and the mean difference reported with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

          <title>Compare BD Nano™ PRO vs Each of 3 Comparator Pen Needles (Needle Breaking)</title>
          <description>A needle was considered broken if the patient end and canula was separated into 2 pieces. The number and proportion of needle breaking occurrence for each pen needle type were summarized. The incidence of broken needle events for the BD Nano PRO was compared to each of the 3 comparator products and the mean difference reported with a 95% confidence interval.</description>
