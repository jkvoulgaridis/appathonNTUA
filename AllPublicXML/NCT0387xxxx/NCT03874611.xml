      Primary objective

      Demonstrate functional markers derived from electrophysiological signals recorded during
      cognitive tests. These markers should make it possible to optimize the targeting procedures
      of electrode implantation sites for a better effectiveness of deep brain stimulation therapy.

      Research hypotheses

      The mechanisms of action of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) involve the modulation of the
      activity, locally and on a large scale, of functional cortical-subcortical networks showing
      pathological behavior beforehand. The electrophysiological measurements in response to
      different tasks make it possible to highlight precise dysfunctions of these neural networks,
      in relation with the behavioral and / or motor disorders associated with the pathologies
      treated by DBS.

      Consequently, we hypothesize that the exploitation of electrophysiological responses during
      cognitive or sensorimotor tasks performed during the implantation procedure of stimulation
      electrodes in patients treated with DBS will allow :

        -  To collect fundamental data to understanding the physiological functioning of basal
           ganglia in humans ;

        -  To collect functional markers from the operating room in relation to the symptoms
           targeted by the DBS that will help in the choice of implantation site of the stimulation
           electrode ;

        -  Define long-term predictive markers of DBS effects by comparing electrophysiological
           effects measured post-operatively and clinical scores under DBS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathology requiring brain stimulation therapy (criteria of severity, therapeutic
             resistance and severity of disability): motor disorders (eg Parkinson's disease,
             dystonia) or psychiatric disorders (eg OCD, depression).

          -  These pathologies therefore include motor disorders (eg Parkinson's disease, dystonia)
             or psychiatric disorders that can be treated with brain stimulation therapy. Note that
             these are independent of motor disorders. The inclusion criteria obviously depend on
             the pathology.

        As an example for a motor pathology treated by stimulation, in Parkinson's disease the
        following inclusion criteria are used :

          -  patients aged 18 to 75 and affiliated to a social security scheme
