  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women, with early detection being
      the key to improve prognosis and survival.

      Randomized controlled trials have found that screening mammography has decreased the
      mortality of breast cancer by 30%.

      However, with a sensitivity of 70%, mammography has its limitations particularly in women
      with dense breasts.

      The use of breast MRI for screening has increased over the past decade. Most experiences
      exist in women at elevated familial risk of breast cancer. In these women, MRI screening
      shifts the stage distribution of breast cancers toward lower stages and reduces the fraction
      of interval cancers.

      Kuhl et al in 2014 were the first to report on the feasibility of an abbreviated breast MRI
      protocol for breast cancer screening. Their protocol consisting of an unenhanced T1-weighted
      and first contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence, subtraction imaging, and a single MIP
      image.

      This groundbreaking study found that image acquisition and interpretation time could be
      reduced without having a negative impact on diagnostic accuracy.

      Breast MRI screening is associated with high direct and indirect costs. These, together with
      the lack of sites that offer high-level breast MRI, limit clinical access to screening MRIs.

      One reason for the high cost is that current breast MRI protocols are time consuming to
      acquire and read. A typical MRI study occupies the MRI system for up to 40 minutes and
      generates several hundred images.

      DCE-MRI allows the assessment of high-resolution breast morphology and enhancement kinetics
      to depict angiogenesis as a tumor-specific feature. At any given field strength, DCE-MRI is
      the most sensitive modality for breast cancer detection, with a pooled sensitivity of 93%;
      DCE-MRI has good pooled specificity of 71%.

      With the abbreviated MRI protocol, the acquisition time was substantially decreased to 3
      minutes, compared with 17 minutes for the full diagnostic protocol. The interpretation time
      of the abbreviated protocol was 28 seconds on average and 2.8 seconds when the MIP image
      alone was evaluated.
