  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial for resiliency training in adolescents with
      Neurofibromatosis 1 and Neurofibromatosis 2 via secure live video to determine the efficacy
      two stress and symptom management programs. Both programs are 8 week group programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis (NFs) are rare genetic conditions with cure. Adolescents with NF experience
      more symptoms of depression and anxiety, higher levels of stress associated with coping with
      NF symptoms, lower levels of self esteem, difficulties with social skills and social support,
      high rates of learning disabilities, and more pain as compared with the general population
      norms.

      The aims of this study are to compare the effect of two stress and symptom management
      programs tailored for adolescents with neurofibromatosis on quality of life and psychosocial
      functioning. We will also examine the degree to which treatment-dependent improvements in
      quality of life are mediated by improvements in depression, pain intensity and pain
      interference.
