  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is the most common sensory congenital disorder and this condition is diagnosable
      and treatable. Children that are born with hearing loss have to undergo several hearing tests
      to diagnose the condition and many families are delayed in receiving this testing or never
      obtain the needed testing. This research employs a new method for helping children with
      hearing loss receive timely care by using a patient navigator, who is someone who teaches and
      provides emotional/social support for the families of these children.

      The hypothesis of this study is that a patient navigator will hasten the timing of pediatric
      audiological testing, improve compliance with scheduled appointments, and expand parental
      knowledge of pediatric hearing loss.

      For Specific Arm 1:

      The investigators will (1) use a stepped-wedge trial design to deliver patient navigation
      (PN) sequentially in 10 state-funded Kentucky Commission for Children with Special Healthcare
      Needs (CCSHCN) clinics randomized to cross from usual care to PN in steps of 6-month
      intervals over the project period. Prior to initiation of PN at each clinic, the control
      condition will be the standard of care. The overall effectiveness of PN will be tested by
      comparing non-adherence rates during the PN condition to those during the standard of care
      condition. Simultaneously, the investigators will (2) assess preliminary implementation
      outcomes (i.e., acceptability, adoption, recruitment/retention, and fidelity) as well as
      multilevel factors influencing implementation of PN in each clinic.

      For Specific Arm 2:

      Patient navigators will not be used for all subjects at participating clinics.
