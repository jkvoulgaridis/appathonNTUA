  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new treatment for carotid atherosclerotic plaque. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of this technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is an important cause of ischemic stroke. Treatments for
      patients with carotid plaque include lifestyle changes, medical management(such as control of
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) and carotid revascularization(carotid
      endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting). Studies have suggested that plaque morphology and
      composition are important determinants of plaque stability, using serial MR imaging of the
      carotid artery allowed observation of changes in plaque composition. Contrast enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) is a well accepted technique for detection of intraplaque
      neovascularization(IPN) in carotid atherosclerotic disease. The purpose of this trial is to
      evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of SDT. The SDT can induce macrophage
      elimination and inhibit matrix degradation, which will promote plaque lipid depletion,
      inflammation level decrease and changes in other plaque tissue components, leading to plaque
      stabilization and reduction.

    <description>Sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) as sonosensitizer, is dissolved in 0.9% sodium solution for following skin test and intravenous injection. 0.01mg/ml DVDMS solution (0.1ml) is prepared for skin test followed by 0.04 mg/ml DVDMS solution intravenous injection (0.2mg/kg).The target atherosclerotic lesions are marked on the corresponding skin with ultrasound guidance and underwent ultrasound exposure after 4 hours incubation. The therapeutic ultrasonic transducer is fixed to the marked skin site for 15min of each lesion. Ultrasound parameters included intensity of 1.6W/cm2 for carotid lesions, resonance frequency: 1.0 MHz and duty factor: 30%.</description>
