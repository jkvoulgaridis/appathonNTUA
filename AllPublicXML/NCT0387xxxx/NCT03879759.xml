  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the efficacy and tolerability of a regimen of NAC (2400 mg) versus
      placebo for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study 1: Relapse prevention: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial in which participants will receive oral NAC (2400 mg: 2x 600mg tablets twice per day)
      or matching placebo. Trial participants will receive either oral NAC ( dose stated above) or
      matching placebo for up to 4 weeks.

      Study 2: Withdrawal: Trial participants will receive oral NAC (dose stated above) or matching
      placebo within the first 24 hours of their admission for up to 3 days.

      Study 3: Participants from the relapse prevention substudy will also receive 30-minute
      non-invasive brain imaging session prior to and after completing the treatment regime in
      Study 1.

      Both males and females will be recruited for the study.
