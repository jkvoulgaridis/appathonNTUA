  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), increasing risk for early death from
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite advances in glycemic and blood pressure control, a
      child diagnosed with T1D is expected to live up to 17 years less than non-diabetic peers. The
      strongest risk factor for CVD and mortality in T1D is diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Current
      treatments, such as control of hyperglycemia and hypertension, are beneficial, but only
      partially protect against DKD. This limited progress may relate to a narrow focus on clinical
      manifestations of disease, rather than on the initial metabolic derangements underlying the
      initiation of DKD. Renal hypoxia, stemming from a potential metabolic mismatch between
      increased renal energy expenditure and impaired substrate utilization, is increasingly
      proposed as a unifying early pathway in the development of DKD. T1D is impacted by several
      mechanisms which increase renal ATP consumption and decrease ATP generation.

      Caffeine, a methylxanthine, is known to alter kidney function by several mechanisms including
      natriuresis, hemodynamics and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In contrast, to other
      natriuretic agents, caffeine is thought to fully inhibit the local tubuloglomerular feedback
      (TGF) response to increased distal sodium delivery. This observation has broad-ranging
      implications as caffeine can reduce renal oxygen (O2) consumption without impairing effective
      renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

      There are also data suggesting that chemicals in coffee besides caffeine may provide
      important cardio-renal protection. Yet, there are no data examining the impact of
      coffee-induced natriuresis on intrarenal hemodynamic function and renal energetics in
      youth-onset T1D. Our overarching hypothesis in the proposed pilot and feasibility trial is
      that coffee drinking improves renal oxygenation by reducing renal O2 consumption without
      impairing GFR and ERPF. To address these hypotheses, we will measure GFR, ERPF, renal
      perfusion and oxygenation in response to 7 days of cold brew coffee (one Starbucks速 Cold brew
      325ml bottle daily [205mg caffeine]) in an open-label pilot and feasibility trial in 10
      adolescents with T1D already enrolled in the CASPER Study (PI: Bjornstad).
