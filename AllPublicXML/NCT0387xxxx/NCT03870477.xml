      Primary Endpoint:

      • Revision rate due to device related complication(s) or non-union of the femur.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      • Radiographic and clinical fracture healing of the proximal femur using standard scoring
      methods.

    <measure>Radiographic Fracture Healing of the Femur (RUSH)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic fracture healing as seen on x-ray and defined using Radiographic Union Score for Hips (RUSH) scoring system. The RUSH quantifies four measures of healing: cortical bridging, cortical fracture disappearance, trabecular consolidation, and trabecular fracture disappearance. Cortical healing is assessed in four anatomic femoral neck regions (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral) and trabecular healing is measured with two assessments (fracture line disappearance and consolidation of matrix). Each of the 10 assessed dimensions of radiographic femoral neck healing are scored 1 to 3, leading to a minimum score of 10 (no signs of healing) and a maximum score of 30 (perfect healing).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Fracture Healing of the Femur (FIX-IT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Function IndeX for Trauma (FIX-IT) score is an assessment tool for patients with lower extremity fractures, incorporating pain and the ability to weight-bear. The score utilizes two questions to assess the ability to bear weight and two questions to assess pain at the fracture site. The maximum subtotal for each set of questions is 6 points, yielding a maximum overall score of 12 points and a minimum score (lowest weight bearing and highest pain) of 0 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Fracture Healing of the Femur (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) is a five dimensional self-assessment that is comprised of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. These five dimensions can be used to index a subject's health utility on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is death and 1 is perfect health. The scoring rule for EQ-5D permits scores less than 0, implying that some health states may be worse than death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>VAS pain scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100‐mm scale])</description>
