  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burst Wave Lithotripsy (BWL) is a novel method of urinary stone fragmentation that uses
      multi-cycle bursts of low amplitude ultrasound to induce stone fracture. This is in contrast
      to traditional extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), which employs a brief single
      compression/tensile cycle of high amplitude (shock) waves to achieve stone fracture. This is
      a single-arm feasibility study to test the ability of BWL to comminute (fragment) stones in
      humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-center, single-arm, feasibility study. The two centers are located within the
      US and include: University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine and Indiana University (IU)
      Health Urology Clinic.

      The investigative study will be performed in the operating room prior to a standard-of-care
      (SoC) ureteroscopic (URS) laser lithotripsy procedure. The subject will already be under
      anesthesia. Stones will be limited to ≤ 12 mm.

      The study has one (treatment) arm and is approved to enroll up to 40 subjects (with the
      intent to treat 20 subjects). All subjects will be treated with the same output parameters
      for up to a maximum of 10 minutes per stone. The output parameters are nominally defined as:

        -  350 kil0Hertz (kHz) acoustic frequency

        -  7 MegaPascals (MPa) peak negative pressure

        -  20 cycle pulse duration

        -  17 Hz pulse repetition frequency

      A maximum of 3 stones can be treated per subject.

      Safety will be monitored by visual observation of the tissue with an ureteroscopic camera,
      the self-reported occurrences of adverse events, and occurrences of unplanned emergency
      department or clinic visits. Fragmentation will be measured by visual observation with an
      ureteroscopic camera and direct measure of stones removed by basket after the procedure.
