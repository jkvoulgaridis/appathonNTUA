  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After laparoscopic hysterectomy, authors aimed to determine cuff hematoma and a postoperative
      CRP value to help predict the other complications.

      A total of 136 patients who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) were evaluated.
      CRP, White blood cell (WBC) and hemoglobin values (Hb) were measured on the 1st, 2nd and 7th
      days before and after the operation. Complications, pre-postoperative vaginal length and
      female sexual function were evaluated. Fourteen patients who developed cuff hematoma during
      postoperative follow-up were analyzed with the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
      curve. ROC curves with the largest area under the curve for each inflammatory marker were
      compared in order to define the marker with higher diagnostic accuracy.

    <description>The value of Postoperative CRP Levels to predict Postoperative Vaginal Cuff Hematoma ; To evaluate tissue trauma and surgical inflammatory responses, venous peripheral blood samples (C-reactive protein) were taken on the first, second and seventh day postoperatively. CRP values were measured under standardized conditions using turbidometry. CRP levels (mg / dl) were recorded.</description>
