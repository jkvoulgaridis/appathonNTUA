  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended arthrodesis of the spine is indicated in the treatment of deformities. The principle
      of the intervention is to correct the spinal imbalance and to obtain a fusion of the
      vertebral segment operated in order to guarantee the durability of this correction, in order
      to guarantee a functional result the best possible one.

      There is a great disparity in the techniques available to obtain this result: as regards the
      correction of the deformation itself, it is possible to resort to various types of gestures
      aimed at &quot;freeing&quot; the spine to allow the getting the correction. It may be staged or
      transpedicular osteotomies or previous releases (staged discectomies). Regarding the
      arthrodesis itself, this can be obtained by an isolated posterior graft or by a
      circumferential graft itself performed in a time using interbody cages PLIF type (posterior
      lumbar interbody fusion) or TLIF (transforaminal interbody fusion) or in two stages by a
      complementary anterior graft. These are heavy interventions with a high complication rate.

      The choice of this or that technique is based on data from the literature and remains at the
      discretion of the surgeon who makes the surgical indication. However, it has never been
      possible to compare these different techniques in a prospective study. The few articles
      comparing the different techniques tend to show that there is no significant difference
      between the techniques with a higher complication rate for the two-step techniques. However,
      these are retrospective studies, with all the biases that this implies and despite these
      results the disparity in surgical indications remains substantial.

      The objective of this work is therefore to evaluate, according to an identical protocol, the
      different surgical techniques for the treatment of spinal deformities associated with a
      fusion in order to determine the morbidity associated with each of the techniques and if this
      morbidity is justified by a better functional result at a minimum follow-up of two years.
