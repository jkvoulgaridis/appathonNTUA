  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin
      in reducing the weekly percentage of heavy drinking days over the 12 weeks of treatment among
      subjects with moderate to severe Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). A &quot;heavy drinking day&quot; is 4 or
      more drinks per drinking day for women and 5 or more drinks per drinking day for men.

      Secondary: Secondary objectives include assessment of other measures of the effects of
      oxytocin compared with placebo on reduction of alcohol use as well as effects on
      psychological assessments, alcohol craving, alcohol-related consequences, cigarette smoking
      and other nicotine use, retention in the study, and safety and tolerability throughout the
      study.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the weekly percentage of heavy drinking days during the 12 week treatment period. A &quot;heavy drinking day&quot; is 4 or more drinks per drinking day for women and 5 or more drinks per drinking day for men. Drinking data will be collected by the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method.</description>
