    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study aim to evaluate discomforts after extraction of
      temporary tooth under local anesthesia. The first objective is to describe the prevalence of
      the post-extraction pain (PEP), post-extraction bleeding (PEB), post-extraction biting injury
      (PEBI) in children, and the analgesic usage. The secondary objective is to define whether it
      is possible to determine a profile of patients or a type of extraction's procedure predictive
      to PEP and administration of analgesics, PEB or PEBI.

    <textblock>
      125 children in range of 2-15 years indicated for tooth extractions will be included in this
      study.

      Informed consent will be obtained from all individual participants included in this study.

      Immediately after extraction and until the following day, parents will be asked to assess the
      post-operative discomforts and to administrate paracetamol (acetaminophen) as soon as the
      child expressed a pain score â‰¥2 evaluated on the faces pain scale-revised (FPS-R).

      A structured form is designed to obtained information regarding the patient's age, gender,
      socioeconomic level, and cooperation of the child before and during anesthesia or extraction,
      influence of accompanying person, number of previous extraction, dental hygiene. Moreover,
      details about the type of extraction; the indication of extraction (tooth decay, orthodontic
      treatment, obstacle, infection and traumatism), the type of tooth (incisor-canine or molar),
      the degree of root resorption, number of doses of local anesthetic, and presence of
      preexisting or per-operative pain are also collected.
