  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) was defined in 2015 by the Working
      Group of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) as
      interstitial pneumonia with some clinical and/or serological features suggesting presence of
      an underlying autoimmune disorder. However, ofiicial criteria for diagnosis of an autoimmune
      disease are not met.

      Aims of the study:

        1. Determine the incindence of IPAF in comparison with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)
           and classic autoimmune diseases (ADs) in polish pulmonological centers.

        2. Clinical, serological, functional and radiological and histopathological characteristics
           of IPAF patients.

        3. Analysis of diagnostic strategies towards specific IPAF subgroups.

        4. Characterictics of potencial diagnostic, predictive and prognostic features of IPAF.

        5. Prospective assessment of IPAF patients in the courseof 5 years in order to determine
           stability of the diagnosis and potential progression to other diseases, e.g. ADs.

                treatment, disease activity will be fulfilled.

                The majority of diagnostic tests and procedures are routinely performed during
                clinical care.

                The study will be divided into 2 phases:

                  1. Phase 1 - visit 1

                  2. Phase 2 - observation of selected subjects from visit 1 to 5

                Phase 1:

                30 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, including individuals with a long
                medical history and currently undergoing treatment for interstitial lung disease/
                autoimmune disorder are going to be recruited to the study in every clinical
                center, totaling up to:

                  -  210 patients in IPAF group

                  -  210 patients in CTD-ILD group

                Phase 2 Only newly diagnosed patients (individuals who have not been previously
                diagnosed with interstitial lung disease, and such diagnosis was set during phase 1
                of the study) will be recruited to this phase. Due to rare incidence, the
                recruitment phase may take up to 36 months.

                The total number of patients will be

                  -  70 in IPAF group

                on HRCT results and will be recorded in patient's medical history. Sterile solution
                of 0, 9% NaCl will be instilled. 200 ml fluid will be applied with a syringe in
                portions of 25 ml or 50 ml. It is recommended that minimum 60 % of the lavage fluid
                is retrieved.

                Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) testing. Preparation of microscopic slides,
                analysis of the cellular components of the specimen (kind of the most abundant
                cells retrieved, the cells' durability) will be performed according to a standard
                laboratory procedure (guidelines of the Polish Respiratory Society). Total cell
                count along with cells' durability will be measured in a sample taken from the
                filtrate or material after the first spin. Cytospin (routinely 10 min of 1200-2000
                rpm) will be used to prepare the material. May-Grunewald-Giemsa stain will be used
                to prepare the microscopic slides.

                BALF samples will be secured and stored in order to test for potential IPAF
                markers. 15 ml BALF will be divided into Eppendorf 1,5 ml microtubes and then
                stored in - 70 C. Samples will be checked for concentration of S1009A protein,
                chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and chitotrisidase 1 (CHIT 1).

                Specimens of bronchial mucosa taken during BF [procedure not routinely performed
