    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial about the evaluation of the impact of the virtual reality
      intervention on the experience of pain, physical and psychological discomfort, well-being and
      anxiety of women during breast biopsy use of nature virtual reality video.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast biopsy is one of the main tests for the diagnosis of cancer, which generates emotional
      distress and can be a painful procedure. Distraction has considerable efficacy among mild
      psychological methods for reducing pain perception. Virtual Reality is the most advanced
      technology of distraction, with the highest level of immersion in virtual worlds and
      effective results as a non-pharmacological measure in pain perception. However, audiovisual
      resources related to nature have not yet been investigated in this clinical setting.

      This clinical trial aims to verify the impact of the virtual reality intervention on the
      experience of pain, physical and psychological discomfort, well-being and anxiety of women
      during breast biopsy; its influence on the time of the examination; the degree of
      recommendation of the intervention; and if the connection with nature interferes in the
      results obtained on the studied variables. The Immersive Reality intervention will be
      provided during the breast biopsy and the variables will be evaluated using Likert-type
      scales and pain using the Analog Virtual Scale. Our study hypothesis is that this
      intervention reduce the perception of pain / discomfort during the biopsy by connecting with
      nature, reducing anxiety, exam time, and increasing the sense of well-being.

    <description>The Nature Connection Scale is used to verify the affective aspect of the person-environment relationship. It is composed of 14 items, which are answered in a scale of 5 points, ranging from 1 (I totally disagree) to 5 (I totally agree). The higher the score, the greater the individual's connection with nature.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Discomfort and well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the end of the biopsy procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire contains 6 questions that must be answered using the Likert Scale (from 1 to 5).
question: your perception of physical discomfort during the exam. 1 means lot of physical discomfort and 5 a lot of physical comfort.
question: what was your perception of psychological discomfort during the exam. 1 means lot of psychological discomfort and 5 a lot of psychological comfort.
question: how would you rate your sense of well-being during the examination.1 means total absence of well-being and 5 best well-being welfare.
question: how much anxiety you were in relation to the exam. 1 means extremely anxious and 5 nothing anxious.
question: how much anxiety you are in relation to the test result. 1 means extremely anxious and 5 nothing anxious.
question: Would you recommend this virtual reality intervention during exams that could generate some kind of discomfort? 1 means would definitely recommend and 5 would definitely not recommend</description>
