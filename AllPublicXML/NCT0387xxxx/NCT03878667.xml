  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of dietary calcium supplementation on
      weight loss, bone density, and markers of health and fitness in women participating in the
      Curves exercise and diet program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Curves International fitness and weight loss program has become a very popular means of
      promoting health and fitness among women. The program involves a 30-minute circuit training
      program and a weight management program involving periods of moderate caloric restriction
      (1,200 to 1,600 calories per day) followed by short periods of higher caloric intake (2,600
      calories per day). The program is designed to promote a gradual reduction in body fat while
      increasing strength and muscle mass/tone. Researchers in the Exercise &amp; Sport Nutrition Lab
      at Texas A&amp;M University have conducted an extensive study on the effectiveness and safety of
      the Curves fitness and diet program. Results of this initial study have shown that the
      program promotes weight loss, improves markers of health, and improves fitness. However, we
      feel that the program may be even more effective with some additional nutritional
      interventions. Calcium has been shown to slow bone loss and more recently has been found to
      help promote fat loss. If this is the case, supplementing the diet with calcium may promote
      greater benefits in women participating in the Curves fitness/diet program. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the effect of dietary calcium supplementation on weight loss, bone
      density, and markers of health and fitness in women participating in the Curves exercise and
      diet program.
