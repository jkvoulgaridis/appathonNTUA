      This study will evaluate the virologic effect, safety and tolerability of Genvoya® in adults
      during early acute HIV infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label study to describe the effects of early antiretroviral (ART)
      therapy on 1) viral load, 2) safety and tolerability of Genvoya®, 3) clinical outcomes and
      secondarily on HIV-specific immune responses. This study is a sub-study of RV 217 that will
      recruit participants with incident HIV diagnoses from the parent RV 217 cohort. Potential RV
      392 volunteers will be recruited from the RV 217 ECHO cohort if they have been diagnosed with
      incident HIV Infection. Screening procedures for HIV in RV 217 are designed to identify
      participants during acute HIV infection (AHI) or early HIV infection. Participants will
      initiate Genvoya®, a once a day antiretroviral pill within 1 week of enrollment. RV 392
      follow-up visits will largely overlap with RV 217 visits for the study duration of 96 weeks,
      but additional visits will occur early after initiation of Genvoya®. RV 392 participants will
      remain co-enrolled in RV 217 (i.e., RV 217 visits also continue); blood collection will be
      coordinated by the RV 392 team by prioritizing safety labs and then research labs within the
      allotted blood volumes while still meeting scientific objectives for both RV 217 and RV 392.
      Blood tests that are required for both protocols will only be collected once and will not be
      duplicated across the two protocols.

          7. Willing to have photo or fingerprint taken for identification purposes

          8. No history of ART for any reason, i.e., treatment naïve and no HIV-post-exposure
             prophylaxis (PEP) or HIV-pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)) within 90 days prior to
             enrollment

          9. Willing to have blood samples collected and stored.

         10. Adequate renal function: estimated creatine clearance of &gt;50 mL/min according to the
             Cockroft Gault formula 2 weeks prior to enrollment

         11. Urine clean catch: glucose &lt; trace and protein &lt;1+ or as per site-specification 2
             weeks prior to enrollment

         12. Weight is &gt; 35 kg

         13. Female (only women of childbearing potential) Specific Criteria:

        Negative pregnancy test 48 hours prior to enrollment:

        Commits to continued use of adequate birth control method for 96 weeks of the study and
        prior to receiving study ART. Adequate birth control is defined as follows: Contraceptive
        medications delivered orally, intramuscularly, vaginally, or implanted, underneath the
        skin, surgical methods (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), condoms, diaphragms,
        intrauterine device (IUD), or abstinence. If depending on hormonal contraception, check
        package insert for drug interactions and/or consider adding a second barrier method.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any chronic or clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of
             investigator would jeopardize the safety or rights of the volunteer, including but not
             limited to chronic hepatitis, renal insufficiency or failure; clinically significant
             forms of drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness, severe asthma, psychiatric disorders,
             heart disease, or cancer; or a physical finding on examination considered indicative
             of significant disease such as murmur (other than functional), hepatosplenomegaly,
             focal neurological deficit, etc.

          2. Untreated AIDS-related opportunistic infection

          3. An AIDS defining condition diagnosed within 30 days

          4. Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen at any time in the past

          5. Requiring use of any medication that is contraindicated with Genvoya®. See Appendix I
             and the package insert

          6. Women who are breast-feeding

        There are no inclusion/exclusion criteria based on CD4 count because CD4 count can be
        transiently diminished during acute HIV infection and ART initiation during early or acute
        HIV infection offers the potential benefit of limiting reservoir seeding and preventing
        immune destruction regardless of peripheral CD4 count at the time of treatment initiation.
