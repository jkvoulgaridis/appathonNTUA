  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized study evaluates whether a controlled breathing intervention could be
      efficacious for reducing pain in the MRI-guided breast biopsy setting. Support for this
      intervention stems from experimental and clinical studies on the effects of controlled
      breathing on pain. Implementing a controlled breathing intervention during MRI-guided breast
      biopsy has the potential to provide effective pain management in this outpatient setting. The
      primary study objectives are to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a
      novel audio-recorded controlled breathing intervention for reducing breast and body pain in
      women undergoing MRI-guided breast biopsy. The secondary study objectives are to evaluate the
      effects of controlled breathing on measures of physiological reactivity (i.e., blood pressure
      and heart rate), pain catastrophizing, and self-efficacy for pain and anxiety.
