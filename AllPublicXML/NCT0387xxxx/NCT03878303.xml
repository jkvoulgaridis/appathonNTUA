         19. Women with childbearing potential are defined as all women who are physiologically
             able to have a pregnancy, unless they are using an efficient contraceptive method
             during treatment and within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment as below.

               1. Complete abstinence (if this is in line with the subject's preferred and usual
                  lifestyle). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendaring method, ovulation method,
                  symptomatic body temperature method, post-ovulation method) and in vitro
                  ejaculation are unacceptable contraceptive methods.

               2. Patients who have received female sterilization (bilateral ovariectomy with or
                  without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation for at least 6 weeks prior to study
                  treatment. In case of only unilateral ovariectomy, female fertility status must
                  be confirmed by follow-up assessment of hormone levels.

               3. Combination of the following two methods:

                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    -  Barrier contraceptive methods: condoms or cervical cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical cap) coated with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/vaginal suppositories.
                       If women use oral contraceptives only, they should use the same
                       contraceptives at a stable dose for at least 3 months before starting the
                       study treatment.

               4. If women have at least 12 months of natural amenorrhea and are clinically
                  compatible (e.g., at the corresponding age, with a history of vasomotor symptoms
                  or received bilateral ovariectomy with or without hysterectomy, they are regarded
                  as postmenopausal women with no childbearing potential. In case of only
                  unilateral ovariectomy, female fertility status must be confirmed by follow-up
                  assessment of hormone levels before the women can be considered to have no
                  childbearing potential.

         20. Men who have sexual intercourse unless they use a condom during sexual intercourse and
             must not donate sperm from the first dose of study drug until 30 days after
             discontinuation of treatment and do not impregnate their sexual partners during the
             period. Vasectomized males are also required to use condoms to prevent the
             transmission of drugs through semen.

         21. Subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not participate in this study.
