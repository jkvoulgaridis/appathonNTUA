      This phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of olaparib in combination with 177Lutetium-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen
      (177 Lu-PSMA) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

    <textblock>
      This phase 1, open label, multicentre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with 177Lu-PSMA in
      patients with mCRPC. Patients with mCRPC who have previously progressed on a novel AR
      targeted agent (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and/or apalutamide) and have not had prior
      exposure to platinums, PARP inhibitors or 177Lu-PSMA will be eligible for the study. Patients
      can have had prior exposure to docetaxel in the chemotherapy naïve setting or castrate
      setting.

      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose escalation and a dose expansion phase. The
      clinical and translational outcomes from this study will inform the design of future phase
      2/3 clinical trials of this combination.

      This is a single arm study where patients will receive 177Lu-PSMA and olaparib for upto 4
      cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following criteria for study entry:

          1. Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age and must have provided written informed consent.

             second generation AR targeted agent will be made by the local investigator.

          6. Patients must have progressive disease for study entry. This is defined by PCWG3 as
             any one of the following:

         14. Patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of
             olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of
             childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly
