      This phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of olaparib in combination with 177Lutetium-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen
      (177 Lu-PSMA) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

    <textblock>
      This phase 1, open label, multicentre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with 177Lu-PSMA in
      patients with mCRPC. Patients with mCRPC who have previously progressed on a novel AR
      targeted agent (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and/or apalutamide) and have not had prior
      exposure to platinums, PARP inhibitors or 177Lu-PSMA will be eligible for the study. Patients
      can have had prior exposure to docetaxel in the chemotherapy na√Øve setting or castrate
      setting.

      Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose escalation and a dose expansion phase. The
      clinical and translational outcomes from this study will inform the design of future phase
      2/3 clinical trials of this combination.

      This is a single arm study where patients will receive 177Lu-PSMA and olaparib for upto 4
      cycles.
