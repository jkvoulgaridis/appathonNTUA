  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound (US) as first-line imaging technology in detecting focal liver lesions,also plays
      a crucial role in evaluating image and guiding ablation which is the main treatment for liver
      lesions. However, the effect of US in diagnosing liver lesions is challenged by several
      factors including being highly dependent on doctor's experience, low signal-to-noise ratio,
      low resolution for lesion feature,large error from thermal field evaluation during the
      process of ablation and so on. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct an
      intelligent US analysis system depending on the digital information technology. Basing on
      these problems,the following research will be involved in our project: 1) US database of
      liver lesions with seamless connection to Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)
      will be developed, with the aim to provide standard data for intelligent US analysis. 2) Deep
      learning model for accurate segmentation, detection and classification of liver lesions on US
      images will be studied. Then automatic extraction, selection and analysis of liver lesion
      ultrasound features and the intelligent US diagnosis for liver lesions will be realized. 3)
      Proposing a clustering model with deep image features, and depicting the similarity
      measurement of liver cancer, which can be furthered used to link the liver cancer feature to
      optimal ablation parameters. The intelligent decision-making system for quantifying thermal
      ablation will be established. 4) Regression algorithm and Generative Adversarial Nets will be
      developed to extract the image features of liver cancer which will predict risk factors after
      US-guided thermal ablation.Based on the above researches, it is of great value to establish
      an intelligent focal liver lesion US diagnosis system involving intelligent
      diagnosis,personalized ablation strategy and accurate prognosis evaluation, improving the
      level of accurate diagnosis and treatment of liver lesions.
