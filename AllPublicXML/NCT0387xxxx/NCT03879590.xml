    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the efficacy of doxophylline as a steroid sparing treatment in Mexican
      children with asthma treated with medium ir high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It
      is a cross over study in which both groups of patients will receive doxophylline plus a lower
      steroid dose maintaining the same treatment step according to GINA guidelines, one group will
      maintain the same treatment dose while the other will start with doxophylline with the lower
      ICS dose, and by the middle of the study both groups will interchange treatment schemes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are first-line drugs for the treatment of persistent asthma.
      The effectiveness of existing ICS is excellent; however, a number of questions remain
      regarding its possible adverse effects, despite the fact that the use of the inhalation route
      has allowed the minimization of the systemic exposure to these drugs. Methylxanthines are
      widely used in the treatment of asthma. It is one of the few medications for asthma that can
      be administered orally. They are useful especially in patients who cannot adapt to inhaled
      medications. Methylxanthines are unique in exhibiting dual-function properties by inducing
      bronchodilation and having anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Theophylline is
      the oldest methylxanthine and non-specifically inhibits phosphodiesterase, it is a little
      used drug because it has many adverse effects with lower therapeutic index. Doxophylline is a
      drug of the family of methylxanthines, with a similar efficacy compared to theophylline when
      applied in the treatment of various respiratory diseases, but with better tolerability
      profile. Doxophylline has been shown to be a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory drug with a
      wider therapeutic window than other methylxanthines. Clinical studies have reported that
      doxophylline is more effective in improving lung function tests in adults and children, as
      well as in decreasing clinical symptoms, reducing the incidence of adverse effects and the
      need of emergency bronchodilators, with a better profile in terms of safety and it has been
      demonstrated that doxophylline potentially reduces the need for corticosteroids.
