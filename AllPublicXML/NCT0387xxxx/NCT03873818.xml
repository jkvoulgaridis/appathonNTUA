  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well low dose ipilimumab works in
      combination with pembrolizumab in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to the
      brain. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, may
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR, defined as complete response [CR] + partial response
      [PR] + stable disease [SD]) &gt; 6 months in the brain in subjects with melanoma metastatic to
      the brain per modified RECIST (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) 1.1 criteria and
      RANO-BM (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases), and who had experienced
      prior progression on anti-PD1 (programmed cell death protein).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Clinical benefit rate (CBR, defined as complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] +
      stable disease [SD]) &gt; 6 months in the brain in subjects with melanoma metastatic to the
      brain per modified RECIST 1.1 and RANO-BM criteria, and who are treatment naive to anti- PD-1
      agents in the metastatic setting (prior adjuvant anti-PD1 allowed).

      II. To assess overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). III. To evaluate the
      brain-specific safety and tolerability of the combination regimen in patients with or without
      stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) received prior to study entry, or on study.

      IV. To evaluate cytokine levels and changes in the T-cell population in the cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) and blood in patients treated with combination low dose ipilimumab and
      pembrolizumab.

      V. Changes in relative apparent diffusion coefficient as measured by MRI magnetic resonance
      imaging as an early predictor of response.

      VI. To assess changes in circulating cfDNA (cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid) as determinants
      of response and/or markers of early progression.

      VII. Evaluate molecular and immunological changes in extracranial lesions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles for ipilimumab and up to
      35 cycles for pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for
      the first year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

             during the screening period. Acceptable samples include core-needle biopsies for deep
             tumor tissue or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous,
             subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions (i) tumor tissue from bone metastases is not
             evaluable for PD-L1 expression and is therefore not acceptable (c) however, if repeat

             irradiated will not be considered measurable. Regrowth in cavity of previously excised
             lesion will not be considered measurable. Note: Any prior SRT to brain lesions or

             protocol.

          -  Fertile men must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control as described in
             the protocol while on study drug and up to 120 days after the last dose of study drug

          -  Subjects previously treated with SRT &gt; 5 lesions in the brain

          -  Brain lesion size &gt; 3 cm.

          -  Prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Allowable prior therapy: Approved adjuvant
             therapies, which may include molecularly-targeted agents, IFN-a·, and ipilimumab.

               -  Patients who received ipilimumab as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy must have a 6
                  month washout before receiving any dosing on this study.

               -  Cohort A: Prior anti-PD in the adjuvant setting is allowed, but washout period is
                  6 months.

             diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders
             (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or

             to enroll.

          -  Subjects with major medical, neurologic or psychiatric condition who are judged as
             unable to fully comply with study therapy or assessments should not be enrolled.

             [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid (RNA)
             [qualitative] is detected). Note: Without known history, testing needs to be performed
             to determine eligibility. Hepatitis C antibody (Ab) testing is allowed for screening
             purposes in countries where HCV RNA is not part of standard of care.

             (based upon 5 times the expected half-life of dexamethasone) except patients who are
             taking steroids for physiological replacement. If alternative corticosteroid therapy

          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14

             doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease.

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy (excluding skin cancer resection), or
             significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating study drug (unless the wound

             endpoints or the subject's ability to participate.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac disease or congestive heart failure &gt; New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. Subjects must not have unstable angina (anginal
