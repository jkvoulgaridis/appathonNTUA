  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The R-TAVI study is a randomized pilot study examining the use of the right radial artery
      versus the femoral artery for secondary vascular access during transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation (TAVI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The R-TAVI study is a prospective, single institution, pilot study in which eligible TAVI
      patients will be randomized pre-procedurally to receive either secondary radial artery (RA)
      access or femoral artery (FA) access during TAVI. Our study will take place over a projected
      18 month enrollment period.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Patient meets eligibility for TAVR as decided upon by pre-TAVR testing (Echo, cardiac
        catheterization, CTA TAVR, 2 CT surgical consults, heart team discussion). 2) Undergoing
        TAVR procedure and follow-up at Carilion Clinic Cardiology Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH)
        3) Patient's secondary vascular access can be performed femorally OR radially, as
        determined by TAVR operator after review of pre-TAVR CT scan imaging.

        4) Interventional Cardiologist performing the TAVR agrees to consider patient for
        enrollment.

        5) Patient provides consent 6) Age ≥ 18 years old 7) No evidence of precluding arterial
        disease of both femoral arteries 8) No evidence of precluding arterial disease of right
        radial and subclavian arteries 9) Must have palpable pulses in both radial arteries

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Review of pre-TAVR CT scan imaging deems patient unsuitable for radial OR femoral
             secondary access based on presence of excessive calcification, stenosis, or tortuosity
             of the femoral, subclavian, or innominate arteries.

          2. Valve implantation (primary access) planned via alternative vascular access
             (trans-caval, axillary, carotid, direct aortic, trans-apical)—as determined by
             implanting Interventional Cardiologist/TAVR operator.

          3. Prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery in which a radial artery graft was
             harvested and used as a conduit.

          4. Patients on hemodialysis OR with arteriovenous fistulas.

          5. Interventional Cardiologist performing the TAVR declines patient consideration in the
             study.

          6. Patient declines consent.

          7. Urgent or emergent TAVI cases

          8. Patient is already participating in another clinical research study
