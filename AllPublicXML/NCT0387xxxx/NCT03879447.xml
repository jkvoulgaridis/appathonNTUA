    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to the aim of investigating the effectiveness and
      safety of integrative Korean medicine treatment (generally consisting of herbal medicine,
      Chuna manual medicine, bee venom pharmacopuncture and pharmacopuncture, acupuncture,
      electroacupuncture, and cupping) in lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis patients with low
      back pain or sciatica diagnosed by lumbar X-ray and/or MRI and clinical symptoms including
      neurogenic claudication at 3 locations of Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine (Bucheon,
      Daejeon, Busan (Haeundae)) as assessed through of pain, functional disability, walking
      ability, and quality of life patient-reported outcomes with a 5-year follow-up period

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
