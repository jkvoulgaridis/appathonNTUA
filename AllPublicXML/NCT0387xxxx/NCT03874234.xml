  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK profile of single
      and repeat ascending doses of GSK3186899 in healthy subjects. This is a Phase 1 first time in
      human study, to investigate the effect of food on PK of GSK3186899. This study will consists
      of two parts. Part A (dose escalation phase) will be a single ascending, sequential
      cross-over design in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 of subjects. Cohort 1 and 2 will be 4-way cross-over
      which includes 4 dosing regimens of GSK3186899 and placebo (3:1 ratio) under fasted
      conditions. Cohort 3 will be 2-way cross-over which includes 2 treatment periods, 2 dosing
      regimens in fasted and fed conditions. In Part B (repeat dose escalation phase) subjects will
      be randomized to receive repeat doses of either GSK3186899 or placebo (3:1 ratio) in either
      fed or fasted conditions. Part B will be conducted based on the review of all safety,
      tolerability and PK data from Part A. The study duration includes screening, treatment
      periods and follow-up.

             and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion
             criteria, outside the normal reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor (if
             required) agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).
