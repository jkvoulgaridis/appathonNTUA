  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high incidence of women suffering from Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). So
      far, there was no treatment sufficient enough to cure POI. Cell therapy is a rapidly
      developing field and have shown immense promise in the treatment of ovarian dysfunction. In
      this study, the investigator will evaluate the safety of MSC-like cell therapy in women
      suffering from POI.

      The purpose of this work is to explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of human embryonic
      stem cell derived MSC-like cell transplantation in women with POI. MSC-like cells were
      injected directly into bilateral ovaries under transvaginal ultrasound. Patients are
      subjected into 3 groups, with low (0.2×107), medium (0.5×107) and high dosage (1.0×107) of
      cells injection for each ovary. The outcomes of patients were followed after the injection
      every 2 weeks. The investigator mainly follow the safety indexes, and the level of sex
      hormone and signs of follicle growth will also be monitored. The growing follicles will be
      stimulated by exogenous hormone, followed by oocyte retrieval and in vitro fertilization
      (IVF).
