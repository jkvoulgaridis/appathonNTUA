  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In efforts to develop an aggregation point for patient clinical data and data related to DNA
      sequencing in the Comprehensive Cancer Center, this registry will be developed to provide a
      comprehensive data store. The goal of the registry will be to collect information on the
      Cancer Center population undergoing next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) on their tumors or
      liquid biopsies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To capture characteristics of the patient population undergoing next generation
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing of their tumor or liquid biopsy for more efficient
      clinical operations by collecting data on demographics, disease, and previous treatment.

      II. To gather information on the number and type of patients that receive off label,
      standard, timeline or other experimental treatments based on the next generation sequencing
      (NGS) data.

      III. To gather data regarding the patient population that may require financial assistance.

      IV. To describe the patient population, in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics,
      who have consented to have their next generation sequencing data to be linked to their
      clinical records and used for future research.

      V. To collect overall survival for those patients with next generation sequencing data.

      VI. To collect outcomes and response to the standard, experimental and/or off label
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo collection of medical data to be used in the formation of a
      precision oncology registry. Medical data is collected as long as patients are receiving
      treatment for cancer.
