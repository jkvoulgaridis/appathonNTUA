  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up survey of women, 10-12 years after they were included in the
      population-based Stork Groruddalen study of pregnant women, primarily set up to study
      gestational diabetes and related health issues in pregnancy in a multiethnic population. The
      investigators will now update the information about the health status of these women to study
      the development of risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

    <textblock>
      The STORK-Groruddalen is a cohort study of 823 pregnant women. Participation rate was high
      due to facilitation for ethnic minorities and data collection at the local Health Centres,
      set up to study ethnic differences in health to inform prevention strategies to reduce these
      differences. The investigators have published many papers from this well charatertized
      cohort, about gestational diabetes and related health issues in pregnancy. Participants have
      agreed to be contacted for subsequent follow-up surveys.

      The inivestigators are now planning a follow-up study of these woman during 2019-2022, to
      study trajectories for risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases such as
      BMI, blood pressure, lipids, behavioural factors, physical activity and mental health and
      other health issues. The investigators will collect selfreported information through
      questionnaires, perform clinical measurements and take blood samples and buccal swabs.
      Collecting updated information about a range of health outcomes for women in this cohort
      will, together with already collected data, enable us to study the development of risk
      factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in a life course perspective.
