  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was developed to analyze the clinical, biochemical and functional impact of tDCS
      on depressive symptoms in participants with temporal lobe epilepsy, intending to collaborate
      directly in the development of new therapeutic strategies for participants with epilepsy and
      associated mood disorders. Another objective of this work is to add knowledge about
      biosafety, possible behavioral and electrophysiological effects of tDCS in participants with
      temporal lobe epilepsy. Depending on the findings, the study as proposed may provide
      immediate results for the care of participants with epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as an alternative tool in the
      treatment of participants with mood disorders and may also benefit the treatment of
      participants with epilepsy. However, this therapeutic tool has been little explored in the
      treatment of mood disorders in participants with epilepsy. Considering these aspects, the
      main objective of this project is to study the safety and possible therapeutic effects of
      tDCS in depressive symptoms of participants with temporal lobe epilepsy. As secondary
      objectives, stands out the evaluation of the effects of this stimulation on the frequency of
      epileptic seizures and on electrophysiological and biochemical parameters in these
      participants. To do this, after performing semi-structured interviews to evaluate depressive
      symptoms, quality of life and sleep, participants with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy will be
      randomized into two groups: 1) intervention with tDCS in participants with Temporal Lobe
      Epilepsy and depressive symptoms (T) and 2) sham intervention in participants with Temporal
      Lobe Epilepsy and depressive symptoms (S). After studying and characterizing the behavioral,
      biochemical and electroencephalic patterns (EEG), the T group will be submitted to tDCS. The
      control group will perform the same assessments and the same preparatory procedures, but will
      not receive the electrical stimulus. Finally, in addition to the analysis of the
      electroencephalographic patterns of the two groups at the end of each session, the analysis
      of the brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) will also be performed,
      as well as a new clinical evaluation regarding the frequency of seizures and patterns of
      these participants through the same semi-structured interviews conducted initially.

    <description>Considering that the daily outpatient use of tDCS equipment is not feasible for most patients, the Pain and Neuromodulation group of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre developed a portable tDCS device for home use that has a safe protocol, in addition of being easy to use so that the patient can use it at home without help. The safety protocol embedded in the device does not, for example, allow the appliance to be used for more than 20 minutes per day. The device can also provide the assisting staff with data such as the time the patient used the equipment, providing an accurate picture of the patient's adherence to this type of equipment. This tDCS equipment for home use has already been validated in a pilot study and will be used in this work.</description>
