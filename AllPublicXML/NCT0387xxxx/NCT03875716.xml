  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying lowering the standard dose of radiation and chemotherapy
      after surgery, to minimize the side effects and improve the quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to study if less intensive treatments can be used after
      surgery for head and neck cancers that are due to the human papilloma virus (HPV). In
      general, these cancers have better cure rates than other types of head and neck cancers.
      Therefore, the investigators are studying whether we can safely reduce the amount of
      treatment after surgery, such as surveillance (instead of using radiation) or less radiation
      or less chemotherapy, while maintaining good cure rates. The investigators hope that by
      reducing the intensity of treatment, this will lead to less side effects during and after
      cancer treatment.

          -  Clinically fixed or matted nodes

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Note: that HIV positive patients will be eligible.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the teratogenic risks of
             radiation exposure to the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             radiation therapy and supportive care medications required for symptomatic management
             of head and neck cancer side effects as well as general anesthesia required for
             oncologic head and neck surgery, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             enrolled in the study. Pregnancy status will be determined by a serum pregnancy test.
