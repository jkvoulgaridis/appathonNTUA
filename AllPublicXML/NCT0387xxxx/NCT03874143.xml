  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Under the World Health Organization's (WHO) integrated community case management (iCCM) Rapid
      Access Expansion Program (RAcE), World Vision Niger and Canada supported the Niger Ministry
      of Public Health to implement iCCM in four health districts in Niger in 2013. Community
      health workers (CHWs), known as Relais Communautaire (RCom), were deployed in their
      communities to diagnose and treat children under five years of age presenting with diarrhea,
      malaria and pneumonia and refer children with severe illness to the higher-level facilities.
      Two of the districts piloted RCom using smartphones equipped with an application to support
      quality case management and provide good timely clinical data. A two-arm cluster randomized
      trial assessed the impact of use of the mHealth application mainly on quality of care (QoC),
      but also on motivation, retention and supervision

    <description>The maximum QoC score was 31 points; the score was weighted with two-thirds of the score allocated to screening questions and correct identification of the danger signs and signs/symptoms of serious conditions A perfect score was achieved when RComs asked all 10 health screening questions and correctly classified 4 major danger signs and 6 serious symptoms, made appropriate referral, and provided advice to caregivers.</description>
