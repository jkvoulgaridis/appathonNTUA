  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study is to characterize exosomal biomarker levels in patients with
      locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Compare rates
      of exosomal expression before during and after chemoradiation therapy with pathologic
      response rates at the time of APR or LAR. The researchers will also examine the functionality
      of these exosomes in malignant colonic organoids and mouse models of colorectal cancer.

      All male and female patients, aged 18 and older with a histologically proven diagnosis of
      rectal adenocarcinoma, treated on this study will receive neo adjuvant chemotherapy
      (consisting of 5 FU or capecitabine) given concurrently with external beam radiation therapy
      to a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Radiation treatments will be administered daily, Monday
      thru Friday. Within one week prior to beginning chemotherapy and radiation treatments, a
      serum sample will be obtained from each patient. Patients will also have serum samples
      collected every two weeks during radiation, and on the last day of radiation therapy, as well
      as at their one month follow up visit after completion of radiation and prior to planned
      surgery. A final serum sample will be collected within one month after definitive surgery.
      Each serum sample collected will be less than 50 mL.

      The study will involve obtaining serum samples from patients before during and after
      chemoradiation therapy. These serum samples will be analyzed to determine exosomal biomarker
      levels, which will be correlated with clinical, imaging, laboratory, and pathologic data
      obtained from the medical record.

      Additional data from the patients' medical records will be collected, including demographic
      data, clinical information from notes in the medical record, radiology images and reports,
      results of diagnositic tests, and information from procedure notes and pathology reports.

    <description>Compare rates of exosomal expression before during and after chemoradiation therapy with pathologic response rates at the time of APR or LAR. Response rates will be graded based on College of American Pathologists Guidelines on neoadjuvant treatment effect, which consist of a 4 tiered grading system categorizing response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation as &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;minimal&quot;, or &quot;poor&quot;. These grades are routinely documented in pathology reports for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer and will be obtained from review of pathology reports in the patient medical records.</description>
