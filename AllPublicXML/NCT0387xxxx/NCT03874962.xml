  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The correlation between improvement in oral health, reduction in oral bacterial
      concentration, and status of pneumonia hospitalization remains unclear. To determine the
      effects of professional oral care intervention on the index of oral health, salivary and
      sputum bacterial concentrations, and pneumonia hospitalization status of nursing home
      residents using a quasi-experimental study. Two nursing homes were on demand selected as the
      intervention and control groups; in the intervention group, weekly professional oral care was
      administered in addition to regular oral care by trained dental hygienists. Demographic data
      and oral health status were analyzed. Total salivary and sputum bacterial concentrations were
      determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction.

    <description>Total salivary and sputum bacterial concentrations were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Staphylococcus aureus (strain ID: ATCC 29213) was used to create the standard growth curve of bacteria. After overnight culture, the samples were prepared by 5-fold serial dilution with normal saline and plating in a Petri dish to produce 2.5×103 to 3.9×107 CFU/mL of bacteria. Genomic DNA of bacteria was extracted from 1 mL of each bacterial serial solution using the modified standard method, which followed three basic steps: lysis, precipitation, and purification. The DNA extracts were resuspended in 20 µL of distilled water and stored at −80°C until real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. The standard curve of bacterial concentration was generated by the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using a serial dilution of Staphylococcus aureus genomic DNA and StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).</description>
