  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know that being overweight during pregnancy increases the health risks to
      both mum and baby. There is good evidence that diet or exercise, or both, during pregnancy
      can reduce excessive weight gain. The Best Start study aims to test the theory that obese
      pregnant women with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or over who participate in a structured
      programme of nutrition and lifestyle advice (Foodwise in Pregnancy ™) will achieve the
      recommended weight gain during pregnancy of no less than 5kg and no more than 9.1kg.

      The investigators would like to find out if pregnant women with a BMI of 30 or over who
      receive the Best Start intervention are more likely to effectively manage weight gain during
      pregnancy. To achieve this, the investigators will undertake a trial that randomly puts
      participants into an experimental group, or a control group, which will compare those who
      receive the intervention to those who continue with routine antenatal care. The investigators
      are aiming to recruit around 500 women during the study period. 250 will receive the Best
      Start intervention, and 250 will continue with routine antenatal care.

      The investigators would also like to find out if women who gain the recommended weight during
      pregnancy have better outcomes, compared to women who gain more or less weight. To do this
      the investigators will look at the routine information collected during antenatal and
      postnatal care, for both mum and baby. To do this regardless of the group clients are
      randomised to, the investigators will ask for permission to look at the routine information
      within the participants maternity record. This information includes, weight gained during
      pregnancy, whether the baby is born early, the type of labour and delivery, and any
      complications during the pregnancy or delivery that may have resulted in the need for
      additional care for mum or baby.

      The results of the study will be prepared for publication in scientific journals, and for
      presentation at scientific conferences. All participants will be able to obtain a copy of the
      results once they have been published and any information that could identify participants
      will be removed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will invite obese pregnant women with a BMI ≥30 to participate in a research
      study where participants may be offered a programme of nutrition and lifestyle advice, unless
      participants meet the exclusion criteria.

      The programme of nutrition and lifestyle advice will comprise a series of weekly 7 x 2 hour
      group sessions, which will be delivered in community venues by trained Healthy Lifestyle
      Support Workers (HLSWs) employed within the maternity service.

      The group sessions will follow the scripted &quot;Foodwise in PregnancyTM&quot; manual of nutrition
      information; practical cooking sessions; and information on low impact exercise e.g. walking.
      'Foodwise in PregnancyTM' has been developed by a group of NHS Dietitians and Midwives and is
      adapted from the existing Foodwise for Life programme. Pedometers will be provided at session
      three to raise participants awareness of the benefits of physical activity. The programme is
      participative in its approach to experiential learning.

      The group sessions will also promote breastfeeding (All Wales Maternity Strategy Key
      Performance Indicator/Measure) to assist healthy weight gain for babies, healthy weaning and
      the importance of play and physical activity. Delivery of the sessions will be quality
      assured by a specialist public health dietitian and public health midwife employed within Cwm
      Taf University Health Board.

      Because eligible women will initially be referred by a midwife, all midwives will be trained
      by a public health dietitian on the &quot;Eating for 1, Healthy and Active for 2&quot; Royal College of
      Midwives accredited compact training, to ensure a sensitive and effective conversation (using
      motivational interviewing techniques) that raises the issue of excess weight in pregnancy.
      The Healthy Lifestyle Support Workers, delivering the intervention, will also attend this
      training.
