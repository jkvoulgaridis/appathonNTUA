      Validation of an existing algorithm designed to estimate blood pressure based on collected
      optical signals on patients against two reference methods, which are the arterial catheter
      (arm 1) and the ausculatory sphygmomanometer (arm 2).

      The purpose of the study is to compare the blood pressure values measured by a mobile
      application used with a smartphone and the values measured by reference equipments, which are
      the arterial line and the ausculatory sphygmomanometer .

      In the arm 1 of the study, patients scheduled for general anesthesia at the Centre
      Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and at the Hôpitaux Universitaire de Genève (HUG)
      will be recruited and their pressure will be measured with both mesurement methods. General
      anesthesia is known to generate significant variations in blood pressure at the time of
      induction. During the first minutes of anesthesia, the patient's blood pressure will be
      measured in parallel with the mobile application and with the reference equipment. After the
      intervention, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm the
      reliability of the data obtained with the mobile application.

      In the arm 2, patients scheduled for a medical appointment at the hypertension unit of the
      Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) will be recruited. Their pressure will be
      measured with the mobile application and with the reference equipment at various time points.
      After the intervention, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm
      the reliability of the data obtained with the mobile application.

      In the arm 3, patients scheduled for a medical appointment at the maternity unit of the
      Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) will be recruited. Their pressure will be
      measured with the mobile application and with the reference equipment at various time points.
      After the intervention, the values obtained by the two methods will be compared to confirm
      the reliability of the data obtained with the mobile application.
