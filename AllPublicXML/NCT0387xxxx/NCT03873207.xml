      Study goals are to determine if a novel post-surgical foot offloading device can reduce
      post-operative pain and expedite the return to daily activity following fat grafting.
      Investigators will perform a prospective, randomized study utilizing PopSole™, a novel fully
      customizable post-operative shoe insert, to aid in the recovery of patients post-surgical fat
      graft injections for pain and limited activity due to foot disorders (ie. fat pad atrophy of
      the forefoot, heel, or for chronic plantar fasciitis).

      Standard of care fat grafting is often used in plastic surgery for cosmetic or reconstructive
      reasons. Foot fat grafting, though not considered part of this research trial, is routinely
      offered in the UPMC Aesthetic Plastic Surgery center as a cosmetic surgery option; however,
      treatment modality options following the completion of a foot fat grafting procedure to
      protect the fat grafts and reduce weight bearing on the fresh fat grafts are limited. Current
      standard of care options including crutches, scooters, bulky post-operative shoes (ie. Darco
      shoes [Darco Intl. Huntington WV.]), and the addition of padding to insoles or orthotics that
      attempt to offload the treated area. Most of these devices are flat and provide poor
      anatomical support, leading to compensatory gait issues which can lead to further problems
      and pain in the knees, hips, and back. The most common complication with post-operative foot
      gear is non-compliance: patients do not wear it.

      The investigators have devised a novel foot offloading device (PopSole™) which will allow for
      customization of the area where the fat has been injected into the foot, as well as allow for
      customizable arch support and elevation of the metatarsals. By randomizing patients to
      recovery with standard methods versus this new device, the investigators are hopeful for
      earlier patient ambulation and return to work with decreased pain.

      Subjects will complete the following screening research procedures:

        1. Baseline reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaires and surveys that will take
           approximately 25 minutes to complete:

             -  Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) questionnaire to assess subject ADL and
                function ability

             -  Mayo Clinical Scoring System questionnaire (MAYO) to assess subject pain, activity
                and function

             -  American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society questionnaire (AOFAS) to assess subject
                pain and function

             -  Manchester Foot and Ankle Disability Index to assess subject foot pain/discomfort

             -  Pittsburgh Foot Survey to assess subject pain, activity, life satisfaction/quality
                of life

             -  Offload Device Survey to assess the ease and comfort of the offload device

        2. Foot ultrasounds will be performed to assess and measure baseline thickness of the
           plantar fascia, forefoot, or heel.

        3. 2D Photographs of both feet will be performed for a visual baseline assessment skin and
           soft tissue thickness.

      If the clinical fat graft procedure occurs on a day different from the screening visit, the
      following research activities will be completed at Visit 2 if the subject continues to remain
      interested and eligible for study participation:

        1. Collection of subject's vital signs (Temp, HR, Resp., BP), medication profile,
           allergies, weight, BMI calculation and adverse event collection and reporting.

        2. Medical and surgical history collection review - the Investigator will confirm that the
           subject's medical status has not changed since last seen and the subject continues to
           satisfy eligibility criteria for study intervention.

        3. Performance of a limited physical and foot exam by PI and /or Co-investigator MD

        4. Women of childbearing potential will receive a urine pregnancy dip test with results
           documented to study chart.

        5. Diary cards with instruction to start entry on the diary card 24 hours after the fat
           grafting surgery to continue through Post-operative Visit 4 (Month 1) and be placed to
           study chart. The subject will be instructed to document self-assessment of the following
           events pertaining to the surgical site: Pain, Bruising, Redness of the skin, Itching,
           Swelling, Bleeding, Other (any concerns/issues not listed). The subject will be
           instructed to identify on the diary card the location, date and day of each documented
           event. Unresolved events at Visit 4 will be carried over for documentation to the
           adverse event log.

        6. 2D Photographs of both feet

        7. Offload Device Distribution to remain in use at all times during ambulation and activity
           instruction to stay off of feet as much as possible for 3 days, then limit ambulation to
           10 minutes per hour for 4 weeks and no sports, kicking, running or exercise for 4 weeks.
           Devices will be provided for both feet to maintain symmetry and gait stability between
           the two feet.
