  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stemless shoulder arthroplasty systems with uncemented metaphyseal fixation have been used in
      Europe for glenohumeral osteoarthritis since 2004. The stemless design has several
      theoretical advantages compared with the stemmed shoulder arthroplasty systems: restoring
      patients' anatomy, preserving humeral bone stock, and few complications in component removal
      if the need for a revision arthroplasty arises. The purpose of the study is to compare the
      short-term, patient-reported outcome of stemless and stemmed total shoulder arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis is a common cause of shoulder pain, affecting up to
      one-third of patients older than 60 years. Surgical treatment is indicated for patients with
      glenohumeral arthritis who continue to experience significant symptoms despite an appropriate
      course of non-operative management. Shoulder arthroplasty accounts for the third most common
      joint replacement procedure after the hip and knee arthroplasty. Based on data from the
      National Patient Registry, The Statistical Department of the Danish National Board of Health,
      the use of primary shoulder replacement in Denmark increased from 12 replacements per 100,000
      inhabitants in 2005 to 19 replacements per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015. Glenohumeral
      osteoarthritis is now the most common indication for shoulder arthroplasty in Denmark.

      Many different shoulder arthroplasty designs are available on the market. The stemless
      shoulder arthroplasty system with uncemented metaphyseal fixation has been used in Europe for
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis since 2004. The indications for anatomical stemless TSA are the
      same as for anatomical stemmed TSA: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis.

      The contraindications for anatomical stemless TSA are acute proximal humerus fracture,
      inadequate metaphyseal bone stock, and rotator cuff insufficiency.

      Stemless TSA has several theoretical advantages over stemmed TSA: restoring patients' anatomy
      (humeral shaft angle, humeral head diameter, and lateralization); preserving humeral bone
      stock, and few complications in component removal should the need of a revision arthroplasty
      arise. A recent review of 3,360 anatomical total shoulder arthroplasties found an overall
      complication rate of 10.3%. Periprosthetic fractures accounted for 6.7% and humeral component
      loosening for 1.4% of all complications. Complications related to the stemmed humeral
      component can be divided into intraoperative (malpositioning, false route, periprosthetic
      fracture) and postoperative (loosening, migration, disassembly, periprosthetic fracture, stem
      fracture) complications. When a revision is necessary because of infection or periprosthetic
      fracture, the removal of a well-fixed or cemented humeral component can be challenging and
      lead to bone damage.

      Few outcome studies on stemless TSA are available. A recent review of 11 observational
      studies (published 2010-2016), incorporating a total of 929 patients, reported comparable
      short- and midterm functional outcomes between stemmed and stemless shoulder prosthesis.
      Otherwise, there are few well-conducted and adequately powered clinical studies.

      The objective of this study is to increase knowledge about shoulder function after operation
      with anatomical TSA by comparing the patient-reported outcome after stemmed and stemless
      anatomical TSA for glenohumeral osteoarthritis.

    <masking_description>Patients will be blinded to which implant type they are receive. This will be done by not sharing the operation chart files with the patient's online file records; the inserted shoulder prosthesis will be noted by a unique code in operation file, and the radiologist will be asked not to describe the post-operation x-ray controls.
The primary investigator will conduct the blinded statistical analysis supervised by the biostatistician.</masking_description>

    <measure>Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder Score (WOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The WOOS is a patient-administered, disease-specific ques¬tionnaire for measurement of the quality of life of patients with osteoarthritis. It provides scores for four domains: (1) physical symptoms; (2) sport, recreation, and work; (3) lifestyle; and (4) emotions. Patients answer each question using the visual analogue scale. The WOOS score is calculated by measuring the distance from the left side of the line and calculating the possible score ranging from 0 to 100 (recorded to the nearest 0.5 mm.) It consists of 19 questions, and the total score ranges from 0 to 1900. A maximum score of 1900 signifies that the patient has an extreme decrease in shoulder-related quality of life, whereas a score of 0 signifies that the patient has no decrease in shoulder-related quality of life. The questionnaire has been translated into Danish and validated and tested on patients with shoulder osteoarthritis.</description>

    <description>Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) is a measurement tool for the assessment of outcomes of shoulder surgery. It has been tested and validated in patients with primary or secondary osteoarthritis. The OSS is a 12-item questionnaire, with each item scored from 0-4; thus, the overall score is the sum of the scores received for individual questions. This results in a continuous score ranging from 0 (most severe symptoms) to 48 (least severe symptoms). For simplicity of presentation, the raw scores will be converted to a percentage of the maximum score. We will use a validated Danish version.</description>

    <time_frame>3 and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D, the health status component of the EuroQol assessment (EuroQol Group, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), is a generic instrument for describing and evaluating health-related quality of life. The EuroQol instrument has been designed for self-completion by the respondent.
The EQ-5D is a descriptive system comprising five dimensions in each of which the respondents describe their health state: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The patient choose one of five levels for each dimension, and thus a five-digit number (EuroQol Group 1990) can define the resulting health state. We received permission to use the Danish version (permission ID number 27296).</description>
