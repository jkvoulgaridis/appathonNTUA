  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipid Storage Diseases (LSD) is a group of metabolic diseases that are manifested by exercise
      intolerance or muscle weakness, sometimes accompanied by systemic findings, which develop in
      some stages of muscle contraction due to necessary lipid transfer or destruction pathways.
      Exercise intolerance in LSD can limit not only physical activity but also daily activities.
      In the literature, no study evaluated the activities of daily living in patients with LSD.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exercise capacity and daily living
      activities on the clinical features of LSD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary functions are affected negatively in Lipid Storage Diseases (LSD). It was shown
      that respiratory muscle strength and peak cough flow decreased in these cases. Other
      respiratory system problems can be listed as; diaphragmatic dysfunction, hypoxemia, and
      hypercapnia. Routine evaluation of respiratory function in LSD is recommended. A limited
      number of studies have shown that exercise tolerance is limited by the blockage of fat
      oxidation on the basis of muscle weakness and fatigue in LSD. Although the assessment of
      exercise capacity is also an important indicator of heart-lung capacity monitoring, exercise
      capacity is not routinely measured in patients with LSD. Exercise intolerance can limit not
      only physical activity but also daily activities. In the literature, the investigator's did
      not find any study evaluating the activities of daily living in patients with LSD. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the effect of exercise capacity and daily living activities on
      the clinical features of LSD patients.
