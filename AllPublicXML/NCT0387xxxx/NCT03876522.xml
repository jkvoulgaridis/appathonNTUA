    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented genetic diagnosis of Lafora disease based on mutations in both alleles of
             either the EPM2A or the EPM2B gene and a sibling with a known mutation in EPM2A or
             EPM2B.

          2. Able and willing to comply with the study protocol, including travel to Study Center,
             procedures, measurements and visits, including:

               1. Adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the
                  Investigator

               2. Caregiver/trial partner committed to facilitate patient's involvement in the
                  study who is reliable, competent, at least 18 years of age.

               3. Adequate visual and auditory acuity for neuropsychological testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any known genetic abnormality, including chromosomal aberrations that confound the
             clinical phenotype

          2. Subjects with:

               1. complete absence of speech OR

               2. inability to perform any activities of daily living OR

               3. who are completely bedridden.

          3. Current participation in an interventional or therapeutic study

          4. Receiving an investigational drug within 90 days of the Baseline Visit

          5. Prior or current treatment with gene or stem cell therapy

          6. Any other diseases which may significantly interfere with the assessment of Lafora
             disease.

          7. Have any other conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor would
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion, or could interfere with the subject
             participating in or completing the study.
