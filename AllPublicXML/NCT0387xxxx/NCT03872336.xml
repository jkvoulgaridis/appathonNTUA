  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if administration of a personalized dose of the
      anti-hypertensive medication, labetalol, based on patient's body-mass index, will be more
      effective at controlling severe hypertension during pregnancy, compared to the current
      standard dosing.

      The investigators seek to asses the effect of obesity (BMI&gt;30) on severe hypertension control
      in patients with preeclampsia with severe features. The investigators hypothesize that
      successive administration of 40-60-80 mg of labetolol will reduce time to blood pressure
      control versus the standard dosing, 20-40-80 mg labetolol, recommended by the American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2015.

    <description>Subjects who have sustained severe hypertension (SBP≥160 mmHg and/or DBP≥110 mmHg), 15 min apart receive the experimental dosing of labetolol. Subjects in both groups are managed following the standard guidelines established by ACOG (Committee Opinion #623). For each successive episode of hypertension treatment, patients are asked a set of questions to monitor for adverse medication side-effects. The fetus is electronically monitored for four hours after the last IV dose.</description>
