  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants often receive respiratory support and supplemental oxygen for a prolonged
      period of time during their admission in the NICU. While maintaining the oxygen saturation
      within a narrow target range is important to prevent morbidity, manual oxygen titration can
      be very challenging. Automatic titration by a controller has been proven to be more
      effective. However, to date the performance of different controllers has not been compared.
      The proposed randomized crossover trial Comparing Oxygen Controllers in Preterm InfanTs
      (COCkPIT) is designed to compare the effect on time spent within target range. The results of
      this trial will help determining which algorithm is most successful in controlling oxygen,
      improve future developments in automated oxygen control and ultimately reduce the morbidity
      associated with hypoxemia and hyperoxemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both hypoxemia as hyperoxemia can potentially be harmful to premature infants. Oxygen
      titration during respiratory support is vital to prevent these conditions but is very
      challenging. In the investigator's neonatal intensive care unit preterm infants routinely
      receive automatic oxygen titration performed by a controller. The currently used controllers
      are both proven to be more effective than manual titration, however which of the two
      controllers is most effective in keeping oxygen saturation within target range remains
      unclear.

      This randomized crossover trial tests tests both controllers within every study patient to
      determine which controller is most effective and thereby would hopefully reduce morbidity
      associated with hypoxemia and hyperoxemia the most. The primary outcome measure is the
      proportion of time spent within target range, each controller will be tested for 24 hours
      within the same study subject. This is excluding a 1-hour wash-out period after a change in
      ventilator.

      Eligible infants are randomized to start with either the Oxygenie algorithm or CLiO2
      algorithm and will switch to the other study arm after 24 hours of measurement.
