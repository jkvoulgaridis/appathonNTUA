  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Does stepping training with or without external feedback change functional ability of
           ambulatory patients with iSCI immediately after training?

        -  Are there significant differences between the immediate effects of stepping training
           with or without external feedback in ambulatory patients with iSCI?

      feedback on functional ability relating to walking in ambulatory patients with iSCI
      (between-group comparison).

      Secondary objective To compare immediate effects in a group of stepping training with or
      without the utility of external feedback on functional ability relating to walking in

    <measure>Change of walking balance using Timed up and go test [TUGT]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after complete one section training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test was designed to measure mobility and dynamic balance control related to walking. Subjects will be instructed to stand up from a standard chair, walk at a fastest and safe speed for 3 meters, turn around a traffic cone, walk back and sit down on the chair with or without a walking device. Then the average time required for the 3 trials will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of walking speed using 10 meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after complete one section training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test assessed the time required over the 4 m in the middle of the 10-m walkway at a comfortable and fastest speed with or without an assistive device. The time was converted to a walking speed using the formula:
velocity (m/s) = distance (m)/ time (second).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of lower limb muscle strength using Five times sit-to-stand [FTSST]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after complete one section training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test has used to quantify lower extremity motor strength. The time taken to complete 5 chair-rise cycles at a fastest and safe speed will be recorded for each subject. Then the average time required for the 3 trials will be used for data analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of lower limb support ability [LLSA] on more and less affected legs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after complete one section training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test was assessed to reflect a risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Participants stood upright with placing the tested leg on the digital load cell (Model L6E3-C, accuracy up to 0.1 kg, and uncertainty of the measurement ± 0.082 kg: patent application number 1701004050) and the other leg posterolaterally to the tested leg. Participants were instructed to shift their body-weight anterolaterally onto the tested leg as much as they could, and step the other leg forward, with or without using the arms according to their ability. Then the LLSA data was reported in term of percent of the participant's body-weight. These data were presented for the less and more affected limbs as identified using the sensorimotor scores. Each participant performed five trials per leg, the first two trials served as practice trials, and an other three trials were used for data analysis.</description>

    <description>Subjects stand in a step standing position with placing one leg on the load cells of the device and the other leg at the posterolateral direction to the trained leg outside the load cells. Then subjects will be instructed to shift/take their body-weight onto the trained leg as most as they can. If the subjects can take a proper level of their body-weight onto the trained leg, the subjects can step the other leg forward to the marker. Then they have to do the same when steps the leg backward.</description>

    <description>Subjects stand in a step standing position with placing one leg on the load cells of the device and the other leg at the posterolateral direction to the trained leg outside the load cells, look at the displayed section which will be positioned at their eye level. Then subjects will be instructed to shift/take their body-weight onto the trained leg until the green zone of the displayed section is lightened. When the subjects can take a proper level of their body-weight onto the trained leg, the beep sound will be alarmed to trigger the subjects and therapist that the subjects can step the other leg forward to the marker. Then they have to do the same when steps the leg backward.</description>
