      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the SGLT2 inhibitor
      dapagliflozin, as compared with standard care of diabetes, on left ventricular (LV)
      functional change in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patient.

      The ELUCIDATE trial is a prospective, open label, randomized, active-controlled 'proof of
      concept'single centre study conducted in Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. It is
      designed to clarify the LV remodeling by using Speckle-Tracking echocardiography to measure
      cardiac global longitudinal strain (GLS).

      A cohort of 90 type 2 DM patients with normal LV ejection fraction will be randomized to
      either dapagliflozin 10 mg/die or to standard of care group as an active comparator. The
      study consists of 5 visits (see Table 1) and will last half an year, which has been ongoing
      since February 2019.

      The primary outcome is to detect a change in cardiac GLS from baseline to 6 months after
      treatment initiation. The secondary outcomes include changes from baseline to 6 months in
      anthropometric measures, atrial-ventricular mechanics measurements, HbA1C,Homeostatic Model
      Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), epicardial fat and plasma biomarkers regarding
      cardiomyocyte remodeling and inflammation.
