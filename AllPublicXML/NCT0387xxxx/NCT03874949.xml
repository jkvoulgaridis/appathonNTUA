  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of a zinc oxide eugenol sealer containing Enoxolone, a
      non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID) on the pain relief after endodontic treatment.

      The study design is a multicenter, doubled blinded randomized controlled trial. The
      comparator is the equivalent zinc oxide eugenol sealer without NSAID (allocation ratio is
      1:1). The conventional endodontic treatment, using gutta percha and sealer, is done. Patients
      assess their pain for 7 days after permanent root obturation.

    <measure>Postoperative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the efficacy of Enoxolone contained in the SEALITE Ultra formula compared to the SEALITE Regular formula, the pain is assessed by patients on a diary using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS : 0-100 mm) 24 hours after the root canal obturation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain response profil</measure>
    <time_frame>0 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, Day 2, Day 3, Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Patients reporte their pain in a diary at different times after endodontic treatment using a VAS : T0 (at the end of the surgery), 6h post-op, 12h, 24h, Day 2, Day 3, Day 7, and at any other time if necessary. The maximum pain felt is compared between the 2 groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of oral pain treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients reporte the consumption of analgesic treatment in a diary. The proportion of patients who took oral pain medication and the treatment categories are compared between the 2 groups.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events reported by patients on a diary from Day 0 to Day 7 and clinically observed by the dental surgeon will assess the safety and tolerability of sealers and endodontic procedures.</description>

    <description>Patients are treated with SEALITE Regular sealer (zinc oxide eugenol sealer). The SEALITE Regular powder is mixed with SEALITE Liquid according to the manufacturer instructions and added to gutta percha in the root canal for permanent obturation. The apical obturation is assessed by a postoperative radiographic control.</description>
