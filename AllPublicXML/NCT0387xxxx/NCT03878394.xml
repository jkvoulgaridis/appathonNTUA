  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is defined as a functional change in the organism which is not reversible with time
      progression. With this change in the organism, physical and cognitive functions are
      decreasing, and the potential of the individual to establish a balance between the systems
      decreased. For this reason, the aim of this is to investigate the effects of different home
      exercise programs on cognitive function, balance and daily living activities in healthy
      individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 healthy individuals between the ages of 60-80 who agreed to participate in the study will
      be included in the study. Participants will be divided into 2 groups randomly. Both groups
      will be given balance exercises with aerobic exercise. The second group will be given second
      additional cognitive task besides doing usual exercises that the first group is performing.
      Exercises will be given in the form of a home exercise program and the treatment will last
      for 6 weeks. The continuity of the exercises will be controlled by telerehabilitation method.
      The participants will be evaluated before and after the treatment.

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was developed by Nasreddine et al. to distinguish healthy individuals from individuals with mild cognitive impairment. MOCA evaluates 8 different functions including attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visual-spatial skills, calculation and orientation and abstract thinking. The highest score is 30. 21 points and above are considered normal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Test measures the speed of information processing, the ability to suppress a customary behavior, focused attention, the ability to perform an unusual behavior, and the ability to change perceptual setup under varying demands and under a disturbing effect. The standardization studies of Stroop Test in our country were performed by Karakaş et al. The Turkish form was named Stroop Test TBAG Form. The Stroop Test TBAG Form consists of four white cards. Each card has 6 rows sorted randomly and 4 items per line. These cards contain the stimulants of the test.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Benton Face Recognition Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The face recognition test was developed by Benton in 1969. It is standardized to determine the capacity to identify and distinguish unrecognized human faces. This test consists of 22 pages of A4 size and there are face pictures on these pages. Only one page of pages is numbered. There is a stimulant picture on pages with no page numbers. Numbered pages have 6 pictures to select from among the responses. The application period of the test is 5-15 minutes and the time factor is not evaluated separately.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The reliability and validity of the Turkish form was performed by Şahin et al. The Berg Balance Test was designed to assess the balance in elderly adults and to determine the risk of falling. It is performed using a five-point scale to give scores to the subjects performing the fourteen functional activities. The maximum score in the Berg Balance Test is 56.A score below 40 indicates a reduction of approximately 100%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6DYT) was adapted by American Thoracic Society (ATS) from the &quot;12-Minute Cooper Test&quot; developed by Cooper et al. It is used to evaluate the functional capacity of the person. This test measures the distance a patient can walk on a flat and hard surface for 6 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Geriatric Depression Scale was developed in 1983 by Yesavage et al. Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted in 1997 by Ertan et al. Geriatric Depression Scale consists of 30 questions based on self-report and questions are answered yes or no. Each response with a symptom of depression is evaluated as one point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36 Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a general health screening survey designed in America. The reliability and validity of the SF-36 were performed by Koçyiğit et al. in 50 patients with osteoarthritis and 50 patients with low back pain. Questions examine 8 different subgroups of health. It also includes the physical activity limitations perceived by the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time up and Go Test was developed in 1991 by Diane et al. This test evaluates the risk of falling and mobility in the elderly. Time up and Go Test is a balance and gait index that requires the patient to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, return to the chair and sit down. The time required to complete the task is measured in seconds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental Durum Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental Test (MMT) was developed in 1975 by Folstein. It consists of 11 questions evaluating cognitive functions such as test, recall, language, record memory, calculation, orientation. The applicability and reliability of this test has been enhanced by the Standardized Practice Guide developed by Molloy et al. The MMT is divided into two parts, the first part only requires a voice response and includes orientation, memory and attention; the highest score is 21. The second section tests name capability, follow verbal and written commands and single-handedly write the sentence . It involves copying a complex polygon similar to the Bender-Gestalt Figure. The maximum score is 9.</description>
