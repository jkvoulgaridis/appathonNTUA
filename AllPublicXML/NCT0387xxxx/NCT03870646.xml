  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheostomy is an important tool in the management of respiratory failure in the critically
      ill patient under mechanical ventilation. Although mechanical ventilation can be a lifesaving
      intervention, it is also known to carry several side-effects and risks. Among the most
      frequent complications of mechanical ventilation, obstruction of the airway secondary to a
      mucus plug is both life threatening and a prevalent phenomenon related to mucociliary system
      dysfunction, artificial airway itself and the loss of strength that prevents adequate airway
      clearance. The main indication of tracheostomy is the need for prolonged mechanical
      ventilation that usually occurs in more severe patients, this circumstance having also been
      related to the development of intensive care unit (ICU) acquired weakness. Currently, the
      approach to secretion clearance in critical patients is focused on rehabilitation therapy and
      humidification. Hypertonic saline (HS) is largely used in cystic fibrosis to increase airways
      clearance while little evidence is available in other settings although promising results
      have been reported. In this sense, the use of HS could be beneficial in the prevention of
      airway obstruction in tracheostomized critical patients.

The treatment will be applied through a jet nebulizer located in the inspiratory branch in patients under mechanical ventilation and in the sole tubulant of patients under T-piece oxygen regimen. Salbutamol 100 micrograms / dose, suspension for inhalation in pressure pack: 2 inhalations through the tracheostomy cannula 10 minutes before the application of the nebulization with hypersaline in order to avoid bronchospasm.</description>
