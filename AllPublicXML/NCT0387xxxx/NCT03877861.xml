  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess feasibility and to obtain initial estimates of efficacy of Sleep
      Activity and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) model, which can accurately estimate the impact of
      scheduling factors and sleep history on both safety and productivity. The SAFTE model will be
      used to asses cancer-related fatigue and study potential associations of change in sleep
      patterns to tumor recurrence in patients with high grade glioma. Data will be collected using
      the Readiband™ Sleep Tracker (https://www.fatiguescience.com/sleep-science-technology/). The
      Readiband device captures high-resolution sleep data, validated against the clinical gold
      standard of polysomnography with 92% accuracy. Sleep data is transmitted to the cloud
      automatically for SAFTE Fatigue Model analysis. We will correlate clinical progression data
      obtained from the patient's electronic medical record with SAFTE data.

    <description>Once a patient has consented to study progression, a Readiband™ Sleep Tracker device will be provided to the patient, along with necessary instructions. Patients will return home with the device and fatigue data will be obtained from the device at subsequent standard care follow-up visits. In addition, surveys related to fatigue and quality of life will be administered via secure electronic survey to participants.</description>

        Patients with Grade IV gliomas treated at Abbott Northwestern Hospital's Givens Brain Tumor
        Center will comprise the study population. Patients enrolled in this study must intend to
        complete post-surgery chemoradiation as part of their standard treatment. Twenty-five
        patients will prospectively be included in the study. Aggregate fatigue data and sleep
        patterns for a group of 30 healthy controls will be procured from FatigueScience in a
        de-identified manner for data analysis purposes.
