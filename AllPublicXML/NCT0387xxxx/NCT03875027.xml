    <textblock>
      retrospective review of all patients who underwent PFR for either bipolar hemiarthroplasty or
      total hip replacement will be conducted All patients that fall in the selection criteria from
      2009 to 2018 will be included as part of this study will be selected Patients are identified
      using medical record numbers. A questionnaire containing questions on demographics of the
      patients which includes their age, sex and co morbids. Furthermore, the cause of fracture,
      time from the fracture to presentation in the emergency room, time from the presentation to
      ER to the time patient was in the operating room would be noted. Duration of the surgery.

      The weight bearing status in the ward and follow-up would be noted. Functionality of the
      patient; which is that how much patients are able to carry their normal daily routine work
      would also be noted from the medical records.

      Collected data will be analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, Inc,
      Chicago, IL, USA). Results will be recorded as frequencies, means, Standard Deviation (SD)
      and p-values while statistical tests will be applied for comparative reasons. For all
      purposes a p-value of 0.05 will be considered as the level of significance.
