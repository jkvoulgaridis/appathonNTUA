  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive distracting devices (Virtual
      Reality (VR) headset, Augmented Reality (AR) Headset) are more effective than the standard of
      care (i.e., no technology-based distraction) for improving clinical outcomes in patients
      requiring acute rehabilitation due to deconditioning and surgery. Measures will include
      include range of motion, gait progression, strength progression, time to first out of bed,
      time to first step.

    <measure>Aggregate Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of physical therapy, approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Aggregate movement will be measured by either sensors in the VR/AR headset or by a physical therapist during the participants session</description>

    <measure>Patient and Physical Therapist Feedback</measure>
    <time_frame>Survey of patient and PT satisfaction will be administered after the physical therapy session, duration of survey should take approximately 15 minutes or less</time_frame>
    <description>Survey of patient and PT satisfaction will be administered after the session. Example of survey questions, to which patient answered 'Yes or No,' for patient include 1) 'The VR game helped me during physical therapy' 2) 'I felt less pain when I moved using the VR game' The survey administered to physical therapists will be rated 1-5 (1=Not at all, 5= A lot) with questions such as 1) 'The technology was helpful to my patients during physical therapy' and 2) 'I would like my patient to have access to this technology for future physical therapy sessions'</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>OMNI PRE Questionnaire will be administered after the physical therapy session, duration of questionnaire should take approximately 15 minutes or less</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will self-report fatigue according to the Adult OMNI-Walk/Run RPE Scale (OMNI RPE) scale after both the VR and standard of care portion. The OMNI RPE is an 11-category perceived exertion rating scale with a numerical rating from 0 to 10 (0= Not Tired at All, 10= Very, Very Tired).</description>

    <intervention_name>Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality Headset</intervention_name>
    <description>A virtual reality (VR) headset is a device the participant will wear over his/her head and eyes like a pair of goggles. It blocks out all external light and shows him/her an image on high-definition screens in front of his/hers eyes. It implies a complete immersion experience that shuts out the physical world.
Augmented reality (AR) headset is a device that the participant will wear over his/hers head and eyes and it adds digital elements to a live view.</description>
