      Objective: To assess the frequency of fibromyalgia among women with impaired fasting glucose.

      Materials and Methods: The sample was selected from the patients who applied to the Internal
      Medicine clinic and whose fasting blood glucose level were â‰¥100 and &lt;126 mg/dL in their
      routine examination [Group1 ] and patients whose fasting blood glucose were less than 100
      constituted the control group [Group2 ]. Oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT ] has been applied
      to patients with impaired fasting glucose and whose 2nd hour OGTT levels were under 140 has
      been included. Patients were evaluated in terms of fibromyalgia according to modified 2010
      ACR Fibromiyalgia Criteria. Functional status was assessed by using the Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire [FIQ ].

    <description>Experimental group subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (Group 1) underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and patients with levels &gt; 140 mg/dL at the 2nd hour were excluded because they were diagnosed with &quot;impaired glucose tolerance&quot;</description>

    <description>The control group (Group 2) comprised 73 patients whose fasting blood glucose level was &lt;100 mg/dL and who agreed to participate in the study.</description>

    <intervention_name>oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Implementation of OGTT: The patient was seated in a quiet room after 10-12 h of overnight fasting, and blood samples were drawn. Thereafter, 75 g glucose solution dissolved in 300 mL of water was administeredwithin 5 min. Two hours after this,another blood sample was drawn. During the test, the patient wasn't allowed to rest and eat, but not smoke.</description>
