  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of dexamethasone to enhance labor epidurals when
      administered as an adjunct to local anesthetics via an epidural catheter. Patients undergoing
      elective cesarean sections will be randomized into three groups, each receiving the same
      combined spinal epidural (CSE). At surgical closure, Group 1 will receive 10cc bupivacaine
      0.0625%, Group 2 will receive 10cc bupivacaine 0.0625% +4mg dexamethasone, and Group 3 will
      receive 10cc bupivacaine 0.0625% + 8mg dexamethasone (4mg). VAS, sedation, nausea, and
      satisfaction scoring will be measured on patient follow-up to compare the outcomes of the
      different treatment groups.

      This study will evaluate the ability of dexamethasone to enhance labor epidurals when
      administered as an adjunct to local anesthetics via an epidural catheter. Patients undergoing
      elective cesarean sections will be randomized into three groups using a random allocation
      table. Group assignment will be performed by opening a previously prepared numbered opaque
      envelope containing the assignment. Each group will receive the same combined spinal epidural
      (CSE) containing 10-12mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, 150mcg preservative-free morphine, and 15mcg
      fentanyl. At surgical closure, Group 1 will receive 10cc bupivacaine 0.0625%, Group 2 will
      receive 10cc bupivacaine 0.0625% +4mg dexamethasone, and Group 3 will receive 10cc
      bupivacaine 0.0625% + 8mg dexamethasone (4mg). In order to maintain this as a double-blinded
      study, the patient will not be told which medication was administered and the drug will be
      given by one anesthesiologist and the patient follow-up will be performed by a different
      anesthesiologist. VAS, sedation, nausea, and satisfaction scoring will be measured on patient
      follow-up to compare how these outcomes compare between the different treatment groups.

    <measure>Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale for Pain, uses the Wong-Baker method of presenting faces with different reactions to pain and scales the patient based on the patient selection of a face. The range goes from 0-10. 0 is pain-free and 10 is excruciating pain.</description>

    <measure>Nausea/ Vomiting Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Baxter Retching Faces. (BARF) pictorial faces of someone wrenching that is used to scale a patient nausea and vomiting. The range goes from 0-10. 0 is nausea-free and 10 is intractable nausea and vomiting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pruritus Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus Scale is also a visual analog scale that has a patient rate their discomfort on a number line that gradates the severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sedation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). Its a well known and utilized scale that gradates a patients level of sedation based on various responses to stimuli. The Score goes from -4 to +5. -4 represents a combative and violent patient and +5 represents a patient unresponsive to physical stimuli.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Function</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Bromage scale is a scoring system that assesses lower extremity motor function based on ones ability to flex and extend various parts of the leg. Score is 1-4. 1 is no motor block and 4 is complete motor block.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 hours post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Customer Satisfaction score (CSAT) is a scoring system that scores satisfaction on a 1-5 basis. 1 is very unsatisfied and 5 is very satisfied.</description>
