    <textblock>
      The study will assess if Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) represents a better tool to
      guide healthcare providers in adjusting insulin therapy, by providing a more complete 24-hour
      assessment of glucose values compared to Point of Care (POC) testing, during hospitalization
      and after hospital discharge in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D and T1D

    <time_frame>During hospitalization (up to 10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MARD reflects accuracy of the CGM glucose reading compared to the reference POC reading. This is the current standard for assessing accuracy of glucometer readings. Lower MARD indicates smaller differences between the CGM and meter value; a higher MARD value indicates larger differences. A three way and direct head-to-head comparison of data from the abdomen, upper arm and POC BG will be compared.</description>

    <description>Patients will wear a real-time Dexcom G6 CGM, which provide BG readings every 5 minutes for up to 10 days. In addition, patients will undergo POC testing before meals and bedtime per hospital protocol. Insulin therapy will be titrated based on daily CGM printouts, which will include BG readings, glycemic excursions, hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia values throughout the day. Patients will wear a CGM in the current approved insertion site, the abdomen, and in the upper arm.</description>

    <description>Glucose monitoring by POC testing will be performed before meals and at bedtime. Results will be uploaded in the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The research team together with the PCP team will adjust daily insulin orders based on POC readings (standard of care). In addition, patients will wear a 'blinded' CGM (no results will be visualized by patients, nursing staff, PCP or research teams).</description>

    <description>A blinded factory-calibrated continues glucose monitoring sensor system Dexcom G6 will be placed shortly after admission. Two CGM devices will be inserted in all patients - one in the abdomen and one in the arm to also assess differences in blood glucose readings between upper extremity and abdominal insertion sites. Information on CGM readings will be collected daily during the hospital stay up to 10 days using the Dexcom Studio software to download the Dexcom receiver data.</description>
