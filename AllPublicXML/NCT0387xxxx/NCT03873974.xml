      The clinical data from the clinical trial will be used to assess the performance, sensitivity
      and specificity of the experimental DualDur In Vitro Diagnostic System.

        -  The sensitivity of the DualDur in Vitro Diagnostic System will be examined in subjects
           whose physician indicates drug therapy for Lyme borreliosis (positive arm).

        -  The specificity of the DualDur in Vitro Diagnostic System will be examined in healthy
           volunteers declared Lyme borreliosis negative by their physician and all the standard
           laboratory tests prove that they are free of Lyme borreliosis (negative arm).

      The diagnostic system developed by Lyme Diagnostics Ltd. is planned for application in the
      diagnosis during the entire life cycle of Lyme borreliosis.

        Positive trial arm: At least 18-year-old, treatment-naive or treatment-experienced men and
        women with Lyme borreliosis, whose physician indicates drug therapy for Lyme borreliosis.
        Furthermore, they consent to the collection and processing of their data during the
        clinical trial, and to blood sampling for the assessment of the DualDur IVD System, and to
        the diagnostic analyses of these samples in the central laboratory of the trial.

        Negative trial arm: At least 18-year-old healthy volunteers without the symptoms of either
        acute or chronic Lyme borreliosis, who have not been treated for Lyme borreliosis, and all
        the standard laboratory tests prove that they are free of Lyme borreliosis.

        Furthermore, they give their consent to blood sampling for the purposes of the clinical
        trial, to the collection and processing of their data, and to the analyses of their blood
        samples in the central laboratory of the trial.
