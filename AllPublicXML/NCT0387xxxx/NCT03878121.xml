      Background:

      Researchers want see if three new HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) vaccines are safe. Two
      vaccines are carried by live adenoviruses, which are natural and typically cause cold
      symptoms or an eye infection. Researchers want to see if all the vaccines help fight HIV and
      if the adenoviruses are contagious.

      Objectives:

      To test the safety and effects of three new HIV vaccines.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults 18 49 years old (vaccinees)

      Their household and intimate contacts 18 65 years old

      Design:

      Vaccinees will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood and urine tests

      Questions about HIV risk

      Vaccinees will learn how to prevent spreading the viruses and about required contraception
      during the study.

      Vaccinees will get consent forms for their household and intimate contacts. All contacts must
      be age 18 65. All intimate contacts must sign a consent form. Contacts will have 4 visits
      over 8 months for blood tests and a physical exam.

      All applicable participants will have a pregnancy test at every visit.

      Vaccinees will have about 9 visits over 12 months. They will repeat screening tests and get:

      1 of the 2 adenovirus vaccines sprayed in the nose at 2 visits

      The booster vaccine by needle in an arm at 1 visit

      Nasal swabs taken at some visits

      Vaccinees will note their temperature and symptoms for at least 1 4 weeks after each vaccine.

      Vaccinees may choose to have:

      Leukapheresis. Blood will be removed by needle in a vein in one arm. A machine will remove
      white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into the other arm.

      Small pieces of the tonsil removed

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of adenovirus serotype 4
      (Ad4)-based HIV vaccines when administered via the intranasal route to healthy human
      volunteers. It is hypothesized that the vaccines will be safe for human administration and
      will elicit immune responses to the HIV components. All study activities will be carried out
      at the NIH.

      Each study vaccinee will receive 5x10^8 viral particles of either Ad4-Env150KN or
      Ad4-Env145NFL, administered as an intranasal spray at months 0 and 2. An intramuscular
      protein booster vaccination with the heterologous soluble trimeric protein
      VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) with alum will be administered to all vaccinees at month 6.
      Specimens to evaluate immunogenicity will be taken at baseline and at specified time points
      through month 12. The HIV-specific immune responses will be assessed by cellular immune
      function assays (intracellular cytokine analysis, flow cytometry-based killing assays), as
      well as measures of humoral immunity (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and
      neutralization assays).

      The overall goal will be to compare the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad-HIV vaccine
      regimens. Participants who have previously received another HIV vaccine and/or are Ad4
      seropositive will be enrolled into an exploratory arm to be analyzed separately.

      Household contacts willing to participate and all intimate contacts (current and/or those
      expected within the first 4 weeks after vaccination) will also be enrolled and monitored for
      transmission of the vaccine virus by serology.
