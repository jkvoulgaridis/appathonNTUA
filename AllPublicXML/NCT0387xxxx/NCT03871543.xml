      This is a 2-Part, 8-Visit, single-center, open-label, bilateral and dispensing clinical
      study. In Part 1 (Visits 1-4) all subjects will be Test Lens 1, in Part 2 (Visits 1-4)
      eligible subjects will be dispensed Test Lens 2 based on their responses to the CLDEQ-8
      questionnaire. Subjects scoring between 11 and 19 on the CLDEQ will not continue into Part 2

    <measure>Subjective Grade of Lid Margin Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 14 hours of contact lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Lid margin staining of the upper and lower eyelids will be performed in the left eye (OS) only using lissamine green. The following will be graded subjectively for each eyelid: Horizontal length of staining, Sagittal width of staining, and Average staining grade - this is the average of the horizontal and sagittal grades for each eyelid. A final grade will be calculated which is the average of each eyelid's average staining grade.</description>

    <time_frame>Approximately 6 hours of contact lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Images, using Confocal Microscopy will be taken in both eyes for both the upper and lower eyelid in the central lid area. These images will be used to determine the mean density of inflammatory white blood cells.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beginning Day Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes post lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Contact lens comfort will be assessed at the beginning of day using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 - 100, where 0 is uncomfortable and 100 is comfortable.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the criteria listed to be enrolled in the
             study.

               1. They are 18-45 years of age (inclusive).

               2. They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to
                  sign a Statement of Informed Consent.

               3. They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

               4. They agree not to participate in other clinical research while enrolled on this
                  study.

               5. They currently use daily disposable soft daily wear contact lenses (worn
                  bilaterally) (within the last six months) which may be spherical, toric or
                  multifocal.

               6. They agree to wear their lenses for at least 12-14 hours per day.

                  study visits or during the wear of any study lenses.

               5. They have had cataract surgery.

               6. They have had corneal refractive surgery.

               7. They are pregnant or breast-feeding.

                  disease (e.g. HIV) or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions.

               9. They are an employee or immediate family member of an employee of the clinical
                  site (e.g. Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).

              10. They have taken part in any other clinical trial or research within two weeks
                  prior to starting this study.

              11. History of allergy to sodium fluorescein or lissamine green.

              12. They have any corneal distortion e.g. as a result of previous rigid lens wear or
                  have keratoconus.

              13. They any slit lamp findings of Efron Grade 3 or greater (e.g. corneal edema,
                  corneal neovascularization, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) or
                  findings of &lt; Grade 3 which in the investigator's opinion would contraindicate
                  contact lens wear.
