  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, open-label study of to evaluate the long-term safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of VTS-270 (2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) in participants
      transitioning from Study VTS301 in participants with Neurologic Manifestations of
      Niemann-Pick Type C1 Disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-clinical studies and a Phase 1 clinical trial suggest that intrathecal administration of
      VTS-270 in patients with neurologic manifestations of Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease has
      the potential to slow the rate of progression of their neurologic disease. Niemann-Pick Type
      C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative, inherited, autosomal recessive lysosomal
      lipid storage disorder primarily in children and teenagers. The disease is characterized by
      the inability to properly metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within the cell due to
      mutations in the NPC1 gene causing unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in the brain, liver
      and spleen.

      Eligible participants who transition into this study will receive treatment with VTS-270 at
      the last dose level administered in Study VTS301, administered IT via LP infusion every 2
      weeks, for up to a total duration of 3 years or until the investigator considers VTS-270 to
      be no longer beneficial to the participant, VTS-270 receives marketing authorization, or the
      VTS-270 development program is discontinued.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. SAEs were AEs excluding non-serious AEs.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 26, 52, 78, 104, 130, 156, 182 and at end of study (3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The clinician-CGIC is to be conducted by a clinician, trained in performing neurological examinations. This rater will meet with the participant/parent or legal guardian (or caregiver) at the first visit (Baseline Visit) or first visit where this is scheduled if not done at the Baseline Visit, and establish a clinical assessment of the participant based on input from both subject and caregiver according to a standardized review of clinical status and functionality. This assessment, completed at the Baseline Visit prior to administration of the participant's first dose of study drug, is to allow the rater to establish an overall clinical baseline assessment of the participant's status and functionality. The clinician-CGIC, evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = marked improvement since baseline to 7 = marked worsening since baseline, will be assessed.</description>

    <description>The ABR will be used to assess functional integrity of the auditory nerve and auditory brainstem pathways in those participants in whom pure tone audiometry cannot be conducted. A hearing threshold will not be obtained, but the waveform morphology and latencies will be evaluated. NPC-SS scale is based on 9 domains- Eye Movement, Ambulation, Speech, Swallow, Fine Motor Skills, Cognition, Hearing (sensineural), Memory and Seizures. A Likert-like scale will be used to assign nine major domain scores of 0 to 5 (better to worst).</description>
