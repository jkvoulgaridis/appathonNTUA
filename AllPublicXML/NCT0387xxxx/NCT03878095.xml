  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib and ceralasertib (AZD6738) work in treating
      patients with IDH mutant cholangiocarcinoma or solid tumors. Cancer is caused by changes
      (mutations) to genes that control the way cells function. Laboratory studies have shown that
      olaparib and AZD6738 can shrink IDH mutant tumors or stop them from growing. Olaparib and
      ceralasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rates of olaparib and ceralasertib (AZD6738) in subjects
      with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant solid malignant tumors, who will be recruited to 2
      cohorts: a. Cholangiocarcinoma b. Other solid malignant tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of olaparib and AZD6738 in adults with
      recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant solid malignant tumors.

      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2- mutant
      solid malignant tumors.

      III. To determine the duration of response in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant
      solid malignant tumors.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of olaparib and AZD6738.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) concentration in plasma by mass spectrometry and
      correlate with treatment response.

      II. To evaluate 2HG levels in tumor biopsies prior to the beginning of treatment and while on
      therapy and correlate with treatment response.

      III. Correlate 2HG concentration in plasma and in tumor biopsies. IV. To evaluate
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double strand breaks (DSBs) as measured by mass cytometry time of
      flight (CyTOF)-imaging mass cytometry (IMC) in tumor biopsies before and after treatment with
      olaparib and AZD6738.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and ceralasertib PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able to understand the nature of this trial and provide written
             informed consent, prior to any study specific procedures. Patients with impaired
             decision making capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver or legally authorized
             representative (LAR) may be considered eligible for this study at the treating
             physician's discretion, provided that the physician is reasonably sure that the
             possible risks and benefits of the study are clear and that the patient will take the
             drug as prescribed

          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with a cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant tumor
             that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard
             therapy exists. Patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, e.g.
             glioma, are not allowed

          -  Patients must have biopsy-confirmed evidence of an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, confirmed in
             a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory, associated with
             neomorphic activity of the encoded proteins

          -  Previous treatment with a poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP)
             inhibitor is allowed

          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be
             willing to have serial biopsies. Tumor biopsies will be performed on the most
             accessible biopsiable site of disease. All possible precautions to avoid complications
             will be taken, including discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed. If a
             patient opts out of a pre-treatment biopsy, biopsy is not possible, or if a
             pre-treatment biopsy does not yield sufficient tissue for analysis, the patient must
             be willing to provide an archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen, if
             available, for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of 2HG.
             Permission of the study principal investigator (PI) is required in all of the above
             scenarios

               -  In order to maximize the availability of newly obtained specimens for 2-HG
                  analysis, at least 10 biopsies will be required in each group (cholangiocarcinoma
                  and other solid tumors) of 14 patients treated in the first stage of this Simon
                  two-stage design. Thus if 4 patients in an arm have already opted out, further
                  patients may only enroll on that arm (in the first stage) if they agree to
                  undergo the pre- and on-treatment biopsies. If a patient has agreed to undergo
                  the two biopsies and undergoes the pre-treatment biopsy, he or she may not opt
                  out of the second biopsy unless such a biopsy would not be safe (e.g.
                  inaccessible tumor). Permission of the study PI is required in this scenario

               -  All patients must be willing to provide 5 unstained archival slides, if
                  available, for pre-treatment 2-HG analysis and correlation with 2-HG levels in
                  pre-treatment frozen specimens

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo extra blood sampling for correlative studies

             resonance imaging (MRI) or &gt;= 10 mm with callipers by clinical exam OR at least one
             lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed by
             CT/MRI/clinical exam at baseline and follow up visits

          -  Subjects must have progressive cancer at the time of study entry

          -  Prior experimental (non-Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) therapies (other
             than drugs that target ATR) and immunotherapies are allowed. Patients must not have
             received these therapies for 30 days or five half lives of the drug (whichever is
             less) prior to the initiation of study treatment

          -  Toxicities from prior therapies should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, with the
             exception of stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that are not overlapping with presumed
             toxicities of olaparib

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of
             progression for at least 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed
             treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan)
             during the screening period

          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that
             immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required for at
             least 4 weeks (or scheduled assessment after the first cycle of treatment), and a
             risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the investigator favors
             participation in the clinical trial

             unless considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of
             clinically stable disease for 28 days

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment. Major surgeries typically
             require general anesthesia, are associated with an estimated blood loss of &gt; 500 mL,
             and require an overnight hospital stay. Examples include laparoscopic surgery, open
             resection of organs, joint replacements and other orthopedic surgeries, and vascular
             or intracranial surgeries. Examples of minor surgeries include those performed on an
             ambulatory basis, cataract surgery, dental surgeries, cutaneous, endoscopic, and
             arthroscopic procedures. Effects from major surgeries should have recovered to =&lt;
             grade 1, with the exception of stable chronic grade 2 toxicities that are not
             overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib and/or AZD6738

          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent and would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication

          -  Women who are actively breast feeding

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or AZD6738 or any of the excipients
             of the products. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to olaparib or AZD6738

          -  Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
             transplantation (dUCBT)

          -  Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red
             blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable within the last 28 days)

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with olaparib

          -  Receiving, or having received during the 14 days prior to first dose, corticosteroids
             (at a dose &gt; 10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) for any reason

          -  Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months (by New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) &gt;= class 2 where applicable):

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Congestive heart failure or known reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
                  (LVEF) &lt; 55%

               -  Acute myocardial infarction

               -  Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication e.g. complete
                  left bundle branch block, third degree heart block

               -  Significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias e.g. (patients with
                  chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac
                  abnormalities are eligible)

          -  Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., medical history of carotid
             stenosis or pre-syncopal or syncopal episodes, history of transient ischemic attacks
             (TIAs)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (grade 2 or above) requiring clinical intervention

          -  Any factors that increase the risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation or risk of
             arrhythmic events such as
