  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect data on the routine patterns of use, safety and effectiveness, including the
      clinical and technical performance of the CorPath GRX System, in the delivery and
      manipulation of coronary guidewires and stent/balloon catheters, and manipulation of guide
      catheters during PCI procedures in the first 231 patients treated with the CorPath device in
      Japan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center patient registry in Japan of the CorPath GRX
      System to examine its performance during PCI procedures and patient outcomes through 72 hours
      post-procedure or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first.
