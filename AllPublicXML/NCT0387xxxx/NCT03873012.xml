  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective and prospective follow-up study of patients who were
      participating in a randomized comparative study (DETECT-OCT trial) to determine the duration
      of dual antiplatelet therapy for neointimal hyperplasia after Biolimus stent and Everolimus
      stent insertion . The primary objective of this study was to determine the duration of double
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) based on OCT results at 3 months after percutaneous coronary
      intervention with OCT guide and percutaneous coronary intervention with guided angiography.
      After that, patients who were enrolled in the previous DETECT-OCT study will be followed up
      for a 10 years follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be followed for a long time until the 5th and 10th years of patients
      who have been registered for the DETECT-OCT study To assess the patient's status at 5- and
      10-year, follow-up visits are scheduled at the outpatient visit if they are currently
      followed-up at the registry. However, if there is no follow-up observation at the current
      registrar, we will follow-up the telephone survey and visit as much as possible. Patients who
      have already passed the 5-year follow-up period from January 2, 2013, the first time to
      register, will be followed up by medical records to confirm the progress. To track the
      progress to the 10-year follow-up, we will conduct prospective observations by telephone
      survey.
