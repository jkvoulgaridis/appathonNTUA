  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to identify the lowest dosage of mometasone furoate nasal spray
      (MFNS) that provided adequate efficacy with an acceptable safety profile for children (ages
      6-11) with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). The MFNS dose levels of 25, 100, and 200 mcg QD
      were compared with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), as an active control, and placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at Day 8 as Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change from baseline at study day 8 was calculated for TNSS as assessed by the investigator. TNSS was a composite of the individual nasal symptom scores of discharge (rhinorrhea), stuffiness, sneezing, and itching. The 4 individual nasal symptom scores were rated by the investigator at the visit as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual nasal symptom scores (range= 0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms). For each participant, individual scores were totaled and used to calculate the change from Baseline in TNSS at the visit. Participant changes were then used to calculate the mean change for each treatment group at that visit. Change from Baseline = visit score - Baseline score (Day 1 visit). Negative changes indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) [Average of Morning (AM), Evening (PM) Score] Averaged Over Days 1 to 15 as Assessed by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 1 through 15 (average over 15 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline (CFB) averaged over study days 1-15 was calculated for TNSS assessed by participants (with assistance from caregiver). Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, stuffiness, itching, sneezing) in diaries using the scale 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual scores (range=0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms.) CFD=the 15-day average score-baseline score. Scores were recorded twice daily, in the morning (AM) and evening (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to obtain the 15-day average score. If diary entries were missing, an average AM or PM score was not calculated. If neither average AM nor PM score were calculated, the total 15-day average score was not calculated. Baseline score=Mean of the Baseline AM (day of visit plus 3 preceding days) and the Baseline PM (3 preceding days) scores. Negative change indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) at Day 8 as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>The mean change from baseline at study day 8 was calculated for TNSS as assessed by the investigator. TNSS was a composite of the individual nasal symptom scores of discharge (rhinorrhea), stuffiness, sneezing, and itching. The 4 individual nasal symptom scores were rated by the investigator at the visit as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual nasal symptom scores (range= 0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms). For each participant, individual scores were totaled and used to calculate the change from Baseline in TNSS at the visit. Participant changes were then used to calculate the mean change for each treatment group at that visit. Change from Baseline = visit score - Baseline score (Day 1 visit). Negative changes indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) on Day 4 as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>The mean change from baseline at study day 4 was calculated for TNSS as assessed by the investigator. TNSS was a composite of the individual nasal symptom scores of discharge (rhinorrhea), stuffiness, sneezing, and itching. The 4 individual nasal symptom scores were rated by the investigator at the visit as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual nasal symptom scores (range= 0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms). For each participant, individual scores were totaled and used to calculate the change from Baseline in TNSS at the visit. Participant changes were then used to calculate the mean change for each treatment group at that visit. Change from Baseline = visit score - Baseline score (Day 1 visit). Negative changes indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) on Day 15 as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>The mean change from baseline at study day 15 was calculated for TNSS as assessed by the investigator. TNSS was a composite of the individual nasal symptom scores of discharge (rhinorrhea), stuffiness, sneezing, and itching. The 4 individual nasal symptom scores were rated by the investigator at the visit as follows: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual nasal symptom scores (range= 0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms). For each participant, individual scores were totaled and used to calculate the change from Baseline in TNSS at the visit. Participant changes were then used to calculate the mean change for each treatment group at that visit. Change from Baseline = visit score - Baseline score (Day 1 visit). Negative changes indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

For each participant, individual scores were totaled and used to calculate the change from Baseline in TNSS at the visit. Participant changes were then used to calculate the mean change for each treatment group at that visit. Change from Baseline = visit score - Baseline score (Day 1 visit). Negative changes indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) [Average of Morning (AM), Evening (PM) Score] Averaged Over Days 1 to 15 as Assessed by Participant</title>
        <description>Mean change from baseline (CFB) averaged over study days 1-15 was calculated for TNSS assessed by participants (with assistance from caregiver). Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, stuffiness, itching, sneezing) in diaries using the scale 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual scores (range=0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms.) CFD=the 15-day average score-baseline score. Scores were recorded twice daily, in the morning (AM) and evening (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to obtain the 15-day average score. If diary entries were missing, an average AM or PM score was not calculated. If neither average AM nor PM score were calculated, the total 15-day average score was not calculated. Baseline score=Mean of the Baseline AM (day of visit plus 3 preceding days) and the Baseline PM (3 preceding days) scores. Negative change indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) [Average of Morning (AM)/Evening (PM) Score] Averaged Over Days 16 to 29 as Assessed by Participant</title>
        <description>Mean change from baseline (CFB) averaged over study days 1-15 was calculated for TNSS assessed by participants (with assistance from caregiver). Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, stuffiness, itching, sneezing) in diaries using the scale 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. TNSS was the sum of the 4 individual scores (range=0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms.) CFD=the 15-day average score-baseline score. Scores were recorded twice daily, in the morning (AM) and evening (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to obtain the 15-day average score. If diary entries were missing, an average AM or PM score was not calculated. If neither average AM nor PM score were calculated, the total 15-day average score was not calculated. Baseline score=Mean of the Baseline AM (day of visit plus 3 preceding days) and the Baseline PM (3 preceding days) scores. Negative change indicated a decrease in symptom severity.</description>
