  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep sensors, wrist worn accelerometers, polysomnography (PSG), and associated data analysis
      platforms would provide quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the action of
      scratching and sleep quantity in a symptomatic atopic dermatitis (AD) population. The overall
      aim of this research is to validate the use of sensor technology and digital measures to
      quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate scratch and sleep in AD patients, and specifically
      in this study in children ages 2 to 11 years. To evaluate this experimental paradigm, the
      investigators propose using wearable accelerometers, a sleep sensor, PSG, videography and
      associated traditional patient-reported outcome measures/clinical outcome assessments
      (PRO/COA) in patients/caregivers with AD in a well-controlled in-laboratory and at-home
      study.

    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of quantifying scratch and sleep in children with Atopic Dermatitis
      (AD), children, age 2 to 11 years, with AD will be recruited. The subjects will complete
      specific questionnaires related to itch, sleeping habits and AD and continuously wear two
      wrist worn accelerometry devices. The EarlySense Sleep Monitor will also be placed underneath
      the mattress to measure additional sleep related activities.

      The study will be comprised of two overnight sleep laboratory site visits. The clinic visits
      will be followed by a continuous ~48 hour in-home environment assessment period (defined as
      the subject's daily routine environment). During the sleep lab site visit, the subject and
      accompanying parent(s)/guardian(s) will sleep overnight at the facility. The subject will be
      video-recorded during the in-sleep lab visit, wear the wrist accelerometry devices, use the
      sleep sensor and complete assessments (Depending on age, parent/guardian may complete some
      assessments). Upon the completion of sleep lab activities the subjects will then continue to
      wear the wrist accelerometry devices, utilize the sleep sensor and complete Patient Reported
      Outcome/Clinical Outcome Assessments (PRO/COA) assessments during the 48 hour in-home
      assessment. At the conclusion of the in-home portion of the assessment, the subject will
      return the device/s and assessments to the facility and undergo brief assessments/interview.

    <description>One GENEActiv watch will be used on each hand at a sampling rate of 100 Hz to measure movement in the x, y, and z direction. The movement will be analyzed using the algorithm described by Cole et al. to differentiate between periods of wakefulness and sleep.</description>

    <description>Polysomnography (PSG) will be used to report the number of sleep occurrences and appropriate sleep staging based on the scoring guide provided by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for children. The following sleep stages will be scored: Stage W (wakefulness), Stage N1 (NREM 1), Stage N2 (NREM 2), Stage N3 (NREM 3), Stage N (NREM), and Stage R (REM).</description>
