  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational study of a single cohort of the patients who will
      undergo a scheduled living donor liver transplantation.

      The investigators attempt to evaluate the association of intraoperative renal regional oxygen
      saturation and acute kidney injury in patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation.
      Near-infrared spectroscopy sensor will be attached to the skin near bilateral kidney areas in
      all patients and renal regional oxygen saturation will be monitored during the operation.
      Renal regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the patients who developed acute kidney injury
      postoperatively will be compared with rSO2 of the patients who did not.

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is a frequent complication after liver transplantation, which is related
      to poor prognosis and longer hospital stay. There is no sensitive or specific marker for
      predicting postoperative acute kidney injury, although studies of the biomarkers have shown
      promising results.

      Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive and real-time monitoring device for regional
      oxygen saturation measurement. Previous studies revealed that it could be applied to the skin
      near the kidney and be used to monitor renal regional oxygen saturation.

      Therefore, in this study, the investigators will apply near-infrared spectroscopy around
      kidney area to measure real-time renal regional oxygen saturation during liver
      transplantation surgery and investigate the association between the intraoperative renal
      regional oxygen saturation and the development of post-transplant acute kidney injury.
