    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effect of topical hyaluronic acid (HA) application on free gingival
      graft (FGG) donor and recipient sites during the early wound healing period with laser
      Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and to investigate the effect of HA application on the dimensional
      change of the graft.Participants were randomly classified into the test group (TG) and
      control group (CG). HA was applied to both donor and recipient sites in 20 patients who
      formed the TG, whereas HA was not applied to the 20 patients who formed the CG.

    <textblock>
      The healing of a transplanted tissue depends on the formation of blood support between the
      donor and recipient sites.

      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a biomaterial that creates a favorable environment for wound healing
      due to its unique hydroscopic and viscoelastic properties, and it is important for wound
      healing activities.HA induces angiogenesis following degradation and improves the wound
      healing environment.HA supports a mechanism that induces proliferation of capillaries, and
      components produced after HA degradation increase vascularization.Laser Doppler flowmetry
      (LDF) technique is frequently used in the field of plastic surgery for monitoring
      microvascular blood flow to detect insufficient circulation in the skin transplants and flaps
      in the early period and to thereby prevent and predict possible surgical complications.
