      A biospecimen collection study from individuals with EGFR mutant cancers resistant to EGFR
      TKIs or those harboring an Exon 20 insertion mutation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EGFR mutations are detected in approximately 15% of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer.
      There are several types of EGFR mutations including both the common L858R and exon 19
      deletions (accounting for 85%) or the rare exon 20 insertion (accounting for 5-8%) EGFR
      mutations.

      Different types of therapies are being used for these two groups of EGFR mutations.
      Osimertinib is an EGFR inhibitor approved for patients newly diagnosed with EGFR exon 19 or
      L858R mutations and for patients who have been treated with a prior EGFR inhibitor but have
      developed EGFR T790M as a resistance mechanism. In contrast, there are no approved EGFR
      inhibitors for patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations although several
      therapies are under evaluation in clinical trials.

      The Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute (ALCMI) would like to focus on studying the cancers
      of patients previously treated with osimertinib or those with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion
      mutations. The goal is to better understand how these tumors respond to drugs, and what
      happens when tumors stop responding to drugs. By studying these cancers ALCMI hopes to
      accelerate the development of new therapeutic approaches for patients with EGFR mutant lung
      cancer.

      The purpose of this study is the successful generation of at least ten (10), EGFR mutant PDX
      models with full characterization including whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing.
      The models will be generated from three major cohorts:

      A.) EGFR T790M patients who have progressed on osimertinib or other third generation (mutant
      selective) EGFR TKI therapy (n=20) and

      B.) EGFR exon 19 del or L858R patients who have progressed on first line osimertinib (n=20)
      and

      C.) patients with Exon 20 insertion mutations (n=10; regardless of drug therapy). Includes
      EGFR Exon 20 and up to two HER2 Exon20 patients.

      The estimates take into consideration an overall take rate of 20%. Models can be used as a
      resource for clinical and translational research to understand mechanisms of resistance and
      develop new therapies. For cohort B there is no requirement for a specific number of patients
      with either EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations.

        A total of fifty (50) implantations from approximately fifty (50) subjects, meeting all of
        the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria to establish a minimum of ten (10) PDX
        models.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a. Male or female greater than 18 years of age at the time of consent or the age of
             majority in their residing state.

             b. Confirmed diagnosis of EGFR mutant NSCLC.

               1. EGFR T790M patients who have progressed on osimertinib or other third generation
                  (mutant selective) EGFR TKI therapy or

               2. Patients must have an EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R and progressed on first line
                  osimertinib or

               3. Patients with an exon EGFR or HER2 20 insertion mutation.

             c. A clinically-indicated procedure (required by the patient's treating physician)
             scheduled no more than 30 calendar days from date of consent.

             d. A minimum of 21 calendar days between the last dose of systemic therapy and the
             clinically-indicated procedure is strongly requested but not required*.

             e. A minimum of 48 hours between the last dose of an osimertinib therapy or other
             targeted therapies and the time of the clinically-indicated procedure is strongly
             requested but not required*.

             f. Willingness to undergo all study collection procedures and follow up. g. Provision
             of written informed consent by the patient. h. Able to communicate (read, write and
             speak) in English. i. Clinically-indicated procedure to be performed within the US
             (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico), Canada, England, or Israel.

             *A treatment washout period is considered best practice for building a PDX from a
             tumor specimen. However, if this is not medically possible, material may still be
             accepted to attempt to build a PDX. This may have a significant impact on take rate
             therefore accepting tumor specimens with no washout period can impact the overall
             expected take rate of the program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  a. Less than 18 years of age or age of majority for their residing state, at time of
             consent.

             b. No confirmed diagnosis of EGFR exon 19 deletion, L858R or EGFR or HER2 exon 20
             mutation. Patients whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations other than an exon 19 deletion,
             L858R or exon 20 EGFR insertion or HER2 exon 20 insertions are not eligible.

             c. A biopsy or surgical procedure not scheduled for clinical/diagnostic purposes.

             d. Pleural effusion specimens collected outside of the US. e. A clinically-indicated
             procedure scheduled more than 30 calendar days from the date of consent.

             f. Unwilling to undergo all study collection procedures and follow up. g. Unable or
             unwilling to provide consent. h. Unable to communicate in English. j.
             Clinically-indicated procedure not scheduled within the US, Canada, England, or
             Israel.
