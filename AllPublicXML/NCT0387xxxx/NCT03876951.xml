  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in
      females in the world. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used in patients with
      operable breast cancer to enhance the likelihood of breast conservation. New generation of
      treatments or combinations lead to a high rate of pathological complete responses (pCR) in
      patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2) and triple negative
      tumours. Safe omission of surgery in patients who receive NAC and achieve radiologic complete
      response depends on the ability to accurately estimate pCR preoperatively.

      If pathological complete response after NAC could be accurately assessed by VAB, surgery
      could be avoided. In the context of new treatments or combinations with an increased pCR
      rate, this new strategy could induce major changes in clinical practice, leading to breast
      surgery de-escalation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 66 patients will be submitted to percutaneous vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB),
      followed by breast surgery. The primary endpoint of the study is the false negative rate of
      VAB procedure. This rate will be calculated by comparing the detection of invasive or in situ
      carcinoma on surgical specimen versus VAB samples. The secondary endpoints of the study are
      feasibility, VAB procedure technical complications and safety.
