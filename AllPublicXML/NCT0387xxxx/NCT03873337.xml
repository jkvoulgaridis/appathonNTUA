  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the feasibility, initial
      efficacy, and mechanisms of action of our PTSC-S intervention as compared to a time-matched
      intervention that does not address task persistence.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants will attend at least 60% of PTSC-S treatment
      sessions and that those attending the PTSC-S treatment sessions will have a larger percentage
      of abstinent days and larger rates of prolonged- and 7-day point prevalence abstinence (all
      biochemically verified with CO&lt;8ppm) at end-of-treatment and 3-months post quit-date as
      compared to those attending an active, time-matched control intervention based on the NCI's
      Clearing the Air intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that PTSC-S will result in greater task persistence than will a
      control treatment and that greater changes in task persistence will be related to greater
      abstinence rates. While a Stage 1b therapy development study such as this is likely to be
      underpowered to detect mediation, the investigators will nevertheless test an exploratory
      mediational hypothesis that PTSC-S has its effect on smoking abstinence primarily through its
      effect on task persistence.
