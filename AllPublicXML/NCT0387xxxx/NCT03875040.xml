  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the importance of regular physical activity in patients with knee osteoarthritis is
      known, and fear of movement is considered as one of the causes of physical inactivity and is
      widely researched in terms of its role in the pathogenesis of pain, there remains to be
      limited number of studies on kinesiophobia in these patients. In this study, we aimed to
      evaluate the levels of kinesiophobia and physical activity in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis and to investigate whether they were associated with demographic
      characteristics, body mass index, pain intensity, depression, disability, radiological grade,
      and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 96 female and male patients aged 50 to 75 years with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and
      knee pain lasting for more than three months (knee pain intensity over 20 mm on Visual Analog
      Scale-VAS) were included in the study. The severity of pain at night, pain at rest and
      activity-related pain was evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), kinesiophobia by Tampa
      Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Brief Fear of Movement Scale (BFOM), depression by the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), disability by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Arthritis Index (WOMAC), physical activity level by the International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form and quality of life by the Short Form 12 Health Survey
      Questionnaire (SF-12). Age, gender, marital status, educational status, additional disease,
      drug history, and sociodemographic data such as BMI were obtained from the patients and
      recorded in the evaluation form.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>4-8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Based on a four-point Likert type, this scale contains 17 items that evaluate fear and anxiety related to physical activity. A total score of greater than 37 is accepted as statistically significant and interpreted as a high level of kinesiophobia. Minimal and maximal scores could be between 17-68 points. Higher scores indicate higher levels of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of seven items that measure the duration of the participants' physical activity, walking and sitting within the last seven days in the metabolic equivalent (MET)-min/week unit. 3 or more days of vigorous activity of at least 20 minutes per day or 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day or 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-minutes/week are proposed to be moderate level. Vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days and accumulating at least 1500 MET-minutes/week or 7 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities accumulating at least 3000 MET-minutes/week are proposed to be high level.Some activity is reported but not enough to meet categories of moderate or high levels, it is proposed to be low level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 21-item questionnaire that investigates the characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. A score of 10 or higher indicates depression. Minimal and maximal scores can be 0-63 points. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for the Evaluation of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>0.5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For this evaluation, the patient is asked to mark his/her severity of pain on a horizontal 10-cm line with number 0 on one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and number 10 on the other end indicating &quot;very severe pain&quot;. Higher scores indicate higher levels of pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A scale used to evaluate the quality of life, consisting of 12 items inquiring general health, physical condition, physical limitations, mental status, social status, pain, energy and mental limitation over a total score of 100 points. SF-12 is an abbreviated version of SF-36 and has been proven to be reliable and valid. In this study, we evaluated the patients' total, physical and mental SF-12 scores</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A 24-item measure that was developed to evaluate pain, joint stiffness and physical functions in individuals with knee and hip OA. A higher score indicates a higher level of pain, stiffness and functional limitation. In our study, we used the WOMAC total score.</description>
