  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive and demyelinating disease that affects more
      than 2.5 million people in the world and is frequently seen in young adults between 20 and 40
      years of age, especially in women. Although the exact MS in Turkey is not known, it is
      estimated as 40/100,000. According to epidemiological studies in recent years, the prevalence
      and incidence of MS tend to increase. The most common clinical signs and symptoms include
      loss of sensation in the extremities, partial or total vision loss, acute or subacute motor
      dysfunction, cognitive impairment, double vision and gait dysfunction.

      Currently, MS has no definitive cure. Progressive symptoms related to the disease need to be
      managed in order to increase and maintain the quality of life of individuals with MS.
      Pharmacological, physiotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic methods are the most effective
      effective methods in the management of symptoms. However, the efficacy of these methods has
      been demonstrated in clinical trials. The outcomes cannot be generalized to the entire MS
      population because of the inclusion and exclusion criteria that exist in clinical trials. In
      addition, clinical trials are conducted at a specified time interval (usually a short time
      interval is selected) and generally, short-term results are provided. In order to better
      understanding the course of MS, it is of utmost importance that long-term follow-up studies
      are carried out where as many patients are included and patients are followed from the date
      of initial diagnosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the change of physical,
      psychosocial and cognitive characteristics over time and the correlated variables.

      The volunteers from MS patients who attend routine control of the MS outpatient clinic of
      Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Hospital will participate in the study. Physical and clinical
      assessments will be performed by physicians and physiotherapists, and cognitive evaluations
      will be performed by psychologists with 6-month intervals.

    <measure>Timed 25-Foot Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 6 Months, 18 Months, 30 Months, 42 Months, and 54 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. he patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. The score is the average of the two completed trials. Higher time represents slower walking speed and more walking impairment.</description>

During the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has sit down. Higher time represents more static and dynamic balance and mobility impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 6 Months, 18 Months, 30 Months, 42 Months, and 54 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The painDETECT Questionnaire is used to detect neuropathic pain components.The questionnaire consists of seven questions that address the quality of neuropathic pain symptoms; it is completed by the patient and no physical examination is required. The first five questions ask about the gradation of pain, scored from 0 to 5 (never = 0, hardly noticed = 1, slightly = 2; moderately = 3, strongly = 4, very strongly = 5). Question 6 asks about the pain course pattern, scored from -1 to 2, depending on which pain course pattern diagram is selected. Question 7 asks about radiating pain, answered as yes or no, and scored as 2 or 0 respectively. The final score between -1 and 38, indicates the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component. A score of &lt;=12 indicates that pain is unlikely to have a neuropathic component (&lt; 15%), while a score of &gt;= 19 suggests that pain is likely to have a neuropathic component (&gt; 90%).</description>
