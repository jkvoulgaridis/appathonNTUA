  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical benefit of a rapid test for fast diagnosis of bacteremia
      and fungemia from positive blood cultures in case of sepsis. This assay enables rapid
      identification of bacteria and fungi and allows to evaluate bacterial resistance to first
      line antibiotics. The clinical and medico-economic impact of this assay used in addition to
      the current diagnosis strategy (half of the patients) will be compared to the current
      diagnostic strategy alone (other half of the patient).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacteremia and fungemia are severe complications, sometimes life-threatening, of every
      sepsis. During septicemia, every hour matters to start an appropriate antibiotic or
      antifungal treatment as every hour of delay is associated to higher death rate.

      The rapid multiplex PCR assay that is evaluated in this study allows to identify in 60 to 90
      minutes, the bacteria or fungi that is present in the positive blood culture bottles and to
      identify resistance markers to first line antibiotics that are used to treat sepsis. This
      strategy allows quicker adaptation of antibacterial or antifungal treatment based on the
      species of the bacteria or fungi identified and on the results of the resistance markers
      compared to current diagnosis strategy of bacteremia or fungemia. This quicker adaptation
      could lead to improved survival rate, reduced complications of sepsis, reduced hospital stay
      length and could reduce the use of large spectrum antibiotics.
