      This study is conducted with the aim to compare the functional outcome, rate of dislocation,

      hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty with dual mobility cuff.

      This study is conducted with the aim to compare the functional outcome, rate of dislocation,
      complications and mortality after treatment of displaced neck of femur fracture with bipolar
      hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty with dual mobility cuff.

      A retrospective cohort study will be conducted at our tertiary care level 1 trauma center
      .ERC approval wwill taken from Ethical Review Committee of the hospital. Patients of age
      group more than 60 year who underwent hip arthroplasty (bipolar hemiarthroplasty or THA with
      dual mobility implant) between 2015 and 2017 for displaced neck of femur fracture with a
      complete follow up for one year were included.

      Both groups will be assessed for postoperative complications including surgical complications
      (dislocation, periprosthetic fracture and surgical site infection), one year mortality and
      functional outcome via Harris hip score at the latest follow up.

      Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 20.Chi-sqaure test was used to compare categorical
      variables whereas independent sample T-test was used to compare continuous variables. P-value
      of &lt;0.05 was considered significant
