    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well high dose vitamin A compound works in treating participants with
      non-small cell lung cancer that can be removed by surgery. Vitamin A compound may increase
      the number of germinal centers (immune centers that make antibodies mature) in tumor and
      lymph tissues which may be beneficial to patients with cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the percentage of resected cancers containing germinal centers (GCs) in
      patients who receive neoadjuvant vitamin A compound (vitamin A) to controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the abundance of GCs in adjacent lymph nodes in patients who receive
      neoadjuvant vitamin A to controls.

      II. To compare histopathologic responses based on tumor necrosis in lung cancer patients who
      receive neoadjuvant vitamin A to controls.

      III. To compare overall survival of patients who receive neoadjuvant vitamin A to controls.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe immunophenotypic changes of monocytes including myeloid derived suppressor
      cells (MDSCs) in pre- and post-treatment blood samples.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive vitamin A compound orally (PO) for 7 consecutive days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 21 days of completing
      treatment, participants then undergo surgical resection.

      GROUP II: Participants undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.
