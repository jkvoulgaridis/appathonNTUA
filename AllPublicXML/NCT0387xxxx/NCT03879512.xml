    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trials evaluates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of an individualized
      cancer vaccine, based on autologous, tumor-lysate loaded dendritic cells in children and
      adolescents with relapsed high-grade gliomas. In addition, regulatory T cells are depleted by
      a short cycle of metronomic cyclophosphamide upfront of the vaccine in order to facilitate
      induction of immune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed high-grade gliomas (in the following addressed as high-grade gliomas = HGG) in
      children and adolescents represent a very bad prognosis group for which a recommended
      standard salvage therapy is currently not available.

      Combination of Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccination and metronomic cyclophosphamide will be
      investigated in the present trial as a new treatment strategy for these patients: metronomic
      cyclophosphamide has been shown to significantly reduce numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg)
      without inducing general leukopenia. DCs might induce tumour-directed immune responses
      thereby facilitating long-term remissions.

      Cyclophosphamide is an established drug used as an anti-cancer or immunosuppressive substance
      since decades, with extensive experience when used in low, non-myeloablative dosages. DCs
      represent an innovative new strategy in cellular immunotherapy. DCs in cancer patients have
      been used in a number of smaller studies, and in some of these trials, promising results
      could be obtained. Several studies showed a trend towards a prolonged overall survival with a
      few long-term survivors which is otherwise extremely rare in this high-risk population.
      Results seemed to be more favourable in paediatric than in adult patients. Furthermore, in a
      phase III trial of DCs in castration-refractory prostate carcinoma patients, a median
      survival benefit of 4.1 months could be measured. In most of these trials, DCs were generated
      based on non-GMP protocols. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to implement a common
      strategy for DC generation in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-conform fashion and to test
      feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this approach in multiple vaccination centers across
      Germany. The immunostimulatory capacity of DCs will be augmented by simultaneous depletion of
      Treg with metronomic cyclophosphamide.

      In conclusion, this study will evaluate feasibility and safety of DCs generated under GMP
      conditions after Treg depletion in patients with relapsed HGG.
