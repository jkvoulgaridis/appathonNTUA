  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the prevalence of taeniosis and (neuro)cysticercosis in two
      districts in the southern (Gwembe) and eastern province (Chipata) of Zambia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The true prevalence of Neurocyticercosis in Zambia is not well known. Only one study which
      was a pilot study done in Katete district of eastern province demonstrated the prevalence of
      NCC among people with epilepsy. There is need to provide an accurate estimate of the
      prevalence of NCC among people with cysticercosis in Zambia as well as understand the
      clinical manifestations of the disease in humans. Data on the full range of clinical
      characteristics of NCC is essential to accurately estimate the burden of the disease in the
      community.

      The epidemiology work package within the human health sector will create awareness of the
      size of the problem by delivering scientifically generated prevalence data on TSCT and NCC in
      various population groups (adults, children, and those living with epilepsy) in two provinces
      of Zambia. This will form an essential prerequisite for the development of public health
      policy guidelines for the control/elimination of TSCT/NCC in the country.

      Further, environmental factors that could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of
      T. solium eggs will be studied. This will provide essential data in understanding the
      epidemiology of the parasite in endemic regions.

        Study participants will be sampled from villages of two districts in Sambia (Gwembe and
        Chipata). Villages of these districts will be selected at random and all people from these
        villages will be invited to take part in the study. No selection apart from the exclusion
        criteria will take place.
