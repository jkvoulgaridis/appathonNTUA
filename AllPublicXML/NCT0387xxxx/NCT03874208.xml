  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of the comaScore project is to provide an external validation of the
      accuracy of the comaScore, a score derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to predict
      1 year outcome of patients unresponsive to simple orders after traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages (aSAH) and cardiac arrest (CA) in the day 7 - day 45
      period post brain injury.

      The general objective of the comaScore project is to provide an external validation of the
      accuracy of the comaScore, a score derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to predict
      1 year outcome of patients unresponsive to simple orders after traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages (aSAH) and cardiac arrest (CA) in the day 7 - day 45
      period post brain injury. As recent studies reported late awakeners cases, even in cardiac
      arrest and, in contrary, that around 10% of patients with acute brain injury remain with
      permanent disorders of consciousness (DOC), the need of reliable prognosis tool at the early
      phase, while the patient is still in the ICU, is critical. ComaScore, based on the
      quantitative analysis of diffusion tensor imaging, was developed from a derivation cohort of
      506 patients. It is much more performing than existing tools (IMPACT, OHCA) in this respect.

      This study aims to prospectively validate the predictive accuracy of comaScore to predict
      unfavorable outcome at 1-year after the first insult, in an independent sample (external
      validation). Unfavorable outcome is defined as a Glascow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) of 1
      to 3. This scale ranges from 1 to 8. Scores of 1 to 3 correspond to death, vegetative state,
      minimally conscious state or bedridden.
