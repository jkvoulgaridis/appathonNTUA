      A multicenter, open, one-arm clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Jinyouli in
      preventing neutropenia after chemotherapy in elderly lymphoma patients who met the criteria
      for admission. Chemotherapy regimen: The investigator selected according to the specific
      condition the corresponding standard chemotherapy regimen, the chemotherapy regimen used, FN
      risk ≥ 20%, or 10% &lt; FN risk &lt; 20% with at least one high risk factor for FN, from the first
      cycle of chemotherapy, 24-72 after chemotherapy hour subcutaneous injection of Jinyouli.
