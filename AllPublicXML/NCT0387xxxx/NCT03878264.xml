  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the absolute bioavailability of CORT118335 and determine the mass
      balance recovery, absorption, metabolism and elimination, and metabolite profile and
      identification of metabolite structures following a single oral dose of CORT118335 in healthy
      male participants.
