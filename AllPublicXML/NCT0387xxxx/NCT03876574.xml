      A retrospective clinical trial to study the safety and effectiveness of hepatic arterial
      infusion (HAI) in treating patients who have nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastatic to the
      liver. Hepatic-direction drug administration improves the control power for intra-hapatic
      lesions.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of hepatic arterial infusion with gemcitabine,
      floxuridine and dexamethasone in combination with standard treatment (radiotherapy and
      systemic chemotherapy) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastases to liver.

      II. Determine the objective response of intrahepatic lesions of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Determine the median survival time or overall survival time in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-center retrospective study.

      Patients receive DSA-guided implantation of HAI catheter system. HAI is initiated the next
      day. Gemcitabine intra-arterially for 30 minutes on day 1,8, floxuridine, dexamethasone
      intra-arterially continuously on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of
      serious technical catheter-related problems, progression of intrahepatic lesions or
      unacceptable toxicity. Standard treatment of NPC, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy
      (induction chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy) was performed as
      desired.

      Patients are followed every 2 HAI cycles or when necessary.

    <description>Patients undergo DSA-guided implantation of hepatic artery infusion pump. All patients receive the intervention &quot;Hepatic artery infusion of gemcitabine and floxuridine&quot; the next day after pump implantation. The HAI therapy is initiated on day 1, 8: Gemcitabine 1g/m2 for 30 minutes, followed by a blended solution which comprised floxuridine (FUDR) at 0.15 mg/kg/day, dexa-methasone (DXM) at 1 mg/m2/day, low molecular heparin 3200U and saline, lasted for 7 days continuously.Standard treatments of NPC, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy (induction chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy) are performed as desired.</description>
