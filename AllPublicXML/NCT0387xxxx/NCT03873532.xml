  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multi-center, phase IIb/III clinical study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib vs. Capecitabine as a second-line therapy
      in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). About 298 subjects
      are randomly assigned to two study treatment groups in the ratio of 1:1 by Interactive Web
      Response System (IWRS).

        -  Active group: 300 mg of surufatinib，once a day for 3 weeks as a cycle;

        -  Control group: In each 3-week cycle, Capecitabine is given at 1250 mg/m2 by oral
           administration twice a day for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest period (equivalent to
           2500 mg/m2 total daily dose).

      All patients will be treated based on the arm to which they have been randomized. Treatment
      on study will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other
      criteria for discontinuation from study treatment. The tumor assessments are performed with
      imaging every 6 weeks (+3 days) until progressive disease (RECIST v1.1) or death on the study
      treatment period, and the treatment and survival of the patients after progressive disease
      are recorded. Safety indicators include adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and
      changes in electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.

        -  Active group: 300 mg of surufatinib is given by oral administration once a day (QD)
           every 3 weeks;

        -  Control group: In each 3-week cycle, Capecitabine is given at 1250 mg/m2 by oral
           administration twice a day (BID) for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest period (equivalent
           to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose).

      Patients are randomized with the following stratification factors:

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (0 or 1);

        -  Years from the first diagnosis of BTC to the randomization date (≤ 1 year or &gt; 1 year);

        -  The primary site of the tumor (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or extrahepatic
           cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer).

      All patients will be treated based on the arm to which they have been randomized. Treatment
      on study will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other
      criteria for discontinuation from study treatment. The tumor assessments are performed with
      imaging every 6 weeks (+3 days) until progressive disease (RECIST v1.1) or death on the study

             by progressive disease during the treatment or within 6 months after the last
             treatment, or intolerable toxicity during the treatment.

             Note: a. The time of first-line medication is ≥ 1 cycle of combination chemotherapy;
             b. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed in the early stage, and should be
             considered failed as a first-line systemic chemotherapy for progressive disease if
             progressive disease/recurrence occurs during the course of the neoadjuvant/adjuvant
             therapy or within 6 months after the end of treatment; c. The previous first-line
             standard chemotherapy does not contain any small molecular anti-angiogenesis agents or
             monoclonal antibodies, or any drugs related to tumor immunity;

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (Annex 1);

             after the last dosing of the investigational drug. All female patients will be
             considered fertile unless they have had natural menopause, or artificial menopause or
             sterilization (such as hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy or ovarian radiation).
