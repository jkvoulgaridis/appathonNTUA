      The purpose of this study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab, plus pemetrexed and
      carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance
      of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the
      prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. IBI308 (sintilimab) is a recombinant humanized
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab,
      plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating
      patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

    <description>Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy included four drugs. IBI308 was given 200 mg iv infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles; bevacizumab was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg; pemetrexed was given 500 mg/m^2 i.v. injection on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles; carboplatin was given dosed to an area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 i.v. on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles. Surgery will be performed at least 21 days after the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy.</description>
