  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether EC treatment is effective in delaying the progression of
      high-grade lung lesion(s) to invasive lung cancer. Half of participants will be randomised to
      receive either electrocautery (EC) treatment with autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB)
      surveillance (=intervention), or AFB surveillance alone (=control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung develops through a transition of progressive cytological
      aberration, from normal to metaplasia, mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia and then
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) before becoming an invasive cancer. Progression rates to invasive
      carcinoma can vary depending on the initial grade of lesion and it is generally accepted that
      high-grade lesions are more likely to progress to invasive cancer than low-grade lesions.
      Early detection and treatment of these lesions is critical to improving survival. There is no
      evidence base examining how, or whether these high-grade lesions (HGLs) should be treated,
      resulting in diverse treatment practices both nationally and internationally. This is the
      first randomised clinical trial of a bronchoscopic intervention in treating HGLs using EC.

      EARL is a phase II/III multicentre 2:1 randomised controlled trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of electrocautery (EC) in the treatment of high-grade lesions of the lung. All
      patients consented/registered onto the trial will have an autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB)
      to check for high-grade lesions (HGLs) in the lung, as verified by tissue biopsy. Only
      patients with ≥1 lung histologically confirmed lung HGL will be randomised to receive either
      electrocautery ablation (EC) treatment and AFB surveillance (= intervention), or AFB
      surveillance (= control).

      The principal objective of the main phase II trial is to demonstrate that airway High-Grade
      Lesions (HGLs) that are treated with electrocautery are less likely to progress to lung
      cancer compared to HGLs that are not treated with electrocautery.

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm will receive up to three rounds of EC treatment (no more than one round annually) to all their HGLs identified at baseline. Follow-up is the same as for Control Arm patients: an AFB surveillance visit at 6, 12, 24, and at 36 months post-randomisation; with further AFB surveillance visits at 18 and/or at 30 months post-randomisation (dependent on lesion appearance).</description>

    <description>For the purposes of the trial, one round of EC treatment consists of two individual EC treatments with a post-EC AFB in between to check for a response to the 1st EC treatment. Within each round, the second EC treatment will only be administered if the post-treatment AFB confirms presence of persistent high grade disease. Patients in the intervention arm will receive up to three rounds of EC treatment (no more than one round annually) to all their HGLs identified at baseline.</description>
