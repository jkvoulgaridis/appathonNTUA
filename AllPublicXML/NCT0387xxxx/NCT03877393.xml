  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more evidence confirms the relationship between the gut-brain-microbiota axis and
      the symptoms of mood disorders. A potential pathway connecting the intestines and the brain
      in depression is inflammation. Interventions for reducing inflammation and restoring the
      integrity of the intestinal mucosa are promising approaches in patients with major depressive
      disorder (MDD). Gut dysbiosis and the diet containing gluten are potential factors may be
      factors that negatively affect the communication between intestinal and brain. Gluten has a
      high immunogenic potential and affinity for the intestinal mucosa layer. In patients with an
      abnormal reaction to gluten, the elimination diet led to improved mood symptoms. However, the
      relationship between gluten and depression is still poorly understood. Intestinal microbiota
      can affect the digestion of gluten and reduce its immunogenic potential. Studies have shown
      that probiotic supplementation has an anti-inflammatory effect, can lead to changes in
      intestinal permeability and alleviate the symptoms of depression. This evidence supports the
      need for co-therapy, including the elimination of gluten and the restoration of intestinal
      eubiosis to reduce inflammation and modulate the gut-brain-microbiota axis. The objective of
      the SANGUT study is to determine the impact of interventions concerning the
      gut-brain-microbiota axis (probiotic supplementation, gluten-free diet and their combination)
      on the mental state, markers of inflammation and markers of intestinal permeability in adult
      patients with MDD. The study will last 12 weeks and consist of four visits (V): V0 -
      Screening (Day 0), V1 - Baseline (up to 1 week after Screening), V2 (six weeks after
      Baseline), V3 - End of the study (12 weeks after Baseline). The main hypothesis is that
      probiotic supplementation and/or a gluten-free diet will reduce the symptoms of depression,
      lower the level of inflammatory markers and favourably affect the integrity of the intestinal
      mucosal barrier.

    <description>A 10-item questionnaire to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals with mood disorders. The assessment is performed by an experienced clinical psychiatrist. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 (overall score ranges from 0 to 60). The higher score indicates a higher severity of the depressive episode.
MADRS cut-off points include:
0 to 6: symptom absent
7 to 19: mild depression
20 to 34: moderate depression
more than 34: severe depression</description>
