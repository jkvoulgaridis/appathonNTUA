      Analyze the epidemiology and outcome of all patients with heart failure with reduced ejection
      fraction (HFrEF) presented to Asyut university hospital (AUH) and to identify factors
      associated with mortality and all-cause hospitalization at a duration of 6 months follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is nowadays an important health problem and associated with high use of
      resources and healthcare cost, but the prevalence of heart failure is increasing due to
      better care and treatment of HF and to the aging of the population. Epidemiology of HF is
      changing and shifting towards a higher prevalence of patients with HF with preserved ejection
      fraction. Moreover, the outcome of HF is grim. The mortality rate is high and
      hospitalizations are frequent and associated with worse outcomes. The majority of studies
      that analyzed HF outcomes have focused on HF hospitalizations. However, in patients with HF,
      all-cause hospitalizations can affect up to 23-58% of the patients at 1-year follow-up and
      non-cardiovascular hospitalizations are associated with risk of subsequent mortality similar
      to cardiovascular hospitalizations. Despite the evidence that all-cause hospitalizations are
      detrimental in HF patients, few studies have analyzed whether the factors associated with
      all-cause and HF-hospitalizations are different in HF patients.

      However, the characteristics and outcome of HF patients are not well described in developing
      countries like Egypt. Documenting patients' characteristics and the outcome might improve
      management of comorbidities associated with heart failure patients in Egypt as well as the
      disease outcome, However, characteristics and outcome of HF patients are not well described
