    <textblock>
      Aluminum phosphide poisoning (ALP) is a global public health problem, and self-poisoning
      accounts for one-third of the world's suicide rate. In fact, in some parts of developing
      countries, pesticide poisoning causes more deaths than infection. ALP is very common in our
      government and the prognosis of the cases is usually so bad. Toxicity by ALP is caused by the
      liberation of phosphine gas, which causes cell hypoxia due to inhibition of oxidative
      phosphorylation leading to circulatory failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aluminum phosphide poisoning is a major problem, accounting for many Emergency Unit visits
      and hospitalization, the incidence of aluminum phosphide poisoning increasing in the last few
      years.

      ALP is used as pesticides for many years to protect grains in stores and during its
      transportation. The availability of these tablets and their low cost make it an easy and
      common method of suicide in our country with the increasing incidence of social and financial
      problems that face the youth.

      In management, the main objective is to provide effective oxygenation, ventilation, and
      circulation until phosphine is excreted. All patients of severe ALP poisoning require
      continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring and early resuscitation with fluid and vasoactive
      agents. N- acetylcysteine as an antioxidant and cytoprotective agent reduces myocardial
      oxidative injury and increase survival time. Magnesium sulfate helps in scavenging free
      radicals through glutathione (GSH) recovery hence is effective as a parenteral antioxidant in
      this poisoning as well as has been tried for its general membrane stabilizing effect in
      cardiac cells .

      Death after 24 hours occurs usually owing to shock, cardiac arrhythmia, metabolic acidosis,
      and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
