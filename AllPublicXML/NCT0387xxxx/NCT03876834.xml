    <textblock>
      Forty male leukemic patients receiving chemotherapy were selected from National Cancer
      Institute, They were randomly assigned into two groups. Group (A) included 30 patients who
      were trained by Inspiratory muscle trainer for 4 weeks ;5 sessions/week and Group (B)
      included 10 patients as a control group.

      The following measures were taken before and after the study period : Maximum voluntary
      ventilation(MVV) , 2 min walk test, FACT-G questionnaire

      Forty male leukemic patients receiving chemotherapy for at least one cycle and their mean
      ages 37.1 Â± 4.89 years.The patients were selected from National Cancer Institute, Cairo (
      inpatient ward). The study lasted from March 2018 to June 2018. Patients were randomly
      assigned into two groups.Group A (30 patients) who received inspiratory muscles training for
      4 successive weeks, 5 sessions/week; and Group B (10 patients) acted as a control group on
      chemotherapy only. Data obtained from both groups regarding (MVV), 2 min walk test and
      Quality of life questionnaire (FACT-G) were statistically analyzed and compared
