    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot a mobile health intervention, originally designed for
      HIV retention in care, for use in aiding patients with medication refills. The study will
      implement the PositiveLinks Rx app with the Henrico Health department. The study will assess
      user engagement and satisfaction with the app as well as preliminary impact on patient refill
      compliance.

      The study will enrolled provider and patient participants at the Henrico Health Department in
      Virginia who either receive or provide medication refills through the AIDS Drug Assistance
      Program (ADAP). Patient participants will be provided access to a mobile app that allows them
      to track their mood, stress, and medication adherence, access an anonymous online community,
      securely message providers, and receive medication refill alerts. Provider participants will
      be able to view the information entered by enrolled clients, securely message clients, and
      track medication refill processes. Study participants will be asked to provide feedback on
      usability, utility, impact, and effectiveness of the program. Additional assessments will
      evaluate for impact on medication refill adherence and patient-provider communication.
