  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients with cancer have a certain amount of genetic
      mutations in their blood. If certain levels of mutations are found in specific genes,
      patients may have a condition known as ARCH. The prevalence of ARCH is higher in cancer
      patients who received prior chemotherapy or radiation. Studying ARCH from your blood samples
      may also help researchers predict which patients are more likely to be prone to heart
      disease. Patients who are about to start chemotherapy/radiation, and patients who have
      completed chemotherapy/radiation will be approached to measure the incidence of ARCH. 5-10mL
      blood samples will be collected before and after treatment, and if ARCH is detected in a
      laboratory analysis, another blood sample will be collected. Patients with ARCH will repeat
      the blood collection yearly, and also be referred to a cardiology clinic for follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, single-centre, observational study assessing the incidence of ARCH
      in cancer survivors. Patients over the age of 60 who had or will receive chemotherapy and/or
      radiation therapy for solid or hematologic malignancies at the Princess Margaret Cancer
      Centre will be considered. Based on the time point of treatment, patients will either fall
      into a post or prior chemotherapy/radiation cohort. Peripheral blood will be taken and will
      be sequenced for ARCH DNA mutations. Patients who have ARCH-related mutations at a VAF of at
      least 0.5% we will repeat the genetic sequencing yearly to assess changes in mutational
      spectrum and VAF over time.

        -  Age ≥ 60

          -  Completed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and are being followed at Princess
             Margaret Cancer Centre i) Patient must be in remission for &gt; 3 months after completing
             chemotherapy or radiation ii) Predicted 5 year survival of &gt;75% iii) Peripheral blood
             counts must have returned to normal as defined by:

               1. Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L

               2. PMN ≥ 1 x 109/L

        Or

          -  Prior to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

          -  All histologically/cytologically proven tumour types (solid tumours and hematologic
             malignancies) will be eligible.

          -  Received or will receive regimens of chemotherapy or radiation with doses expected to
             produce transient myelosuppression (PMN&lt;0.5x109/L) in at least 80% of treated patients
             (The identification and definition of appropriate myelosuppressive chemotherapy and
             radiation regimens will be at the discretion of the treating physician and will vary
             among disease sites).

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and provide
             written informed consent, which includes authorization for release of protected health
             information

          -  Patient must be willing to provide a peripheral blood sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures.
