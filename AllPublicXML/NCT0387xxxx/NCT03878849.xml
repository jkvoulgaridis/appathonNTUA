    <textblock>
      This study is to be performed as an open label, multicenter, single arm study of 2X-121 to
      evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of 2X-121 as single agent therapy in a 28-days cycle in advanced
      ovarian cancer patients. 2X-121 will be supplied for oral administration once daily as 600 mg
      (3 x 200 mg) capsules in a 28 days cycle. Patients with predicted high likelihood of
      responding to the drug (2X-121) using drug response prediction (DRP®), will be included in
      the study.
