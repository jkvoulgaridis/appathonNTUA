  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The level of fibre consumption in France is lower than the national and international
      recommendations (mean 18.8 g/d for men, 16.4 g/d for women (INCA 2007 Study) instead of 30g/d
      recommended). Fibre have beneficial effects on health and interact with the intestinal
      microbiota diversity: a diet fortified with different structure fibres increase of 25 % the
      dysbiotic intestinal microbiota in obese patient (Cotillard et al, Dietary intervention
      impact on gut microbial gene richness. Nature, August 2013). The study aim is to evaluate the
      impact of daily consumption of bread (150 g ) enriched with a mixture of fibres of different
      structure (15g) during two months on the intestinal microbiota composition in metabolic risk
      subjects (abdominal overweight or obese) and also, to assess the correlation between the
      microbiota change and their metabolic profile improvement.It is a mono centric study with a
      centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Rhône-Alpes)
