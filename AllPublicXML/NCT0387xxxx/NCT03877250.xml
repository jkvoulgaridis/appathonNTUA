  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to attempt to obtain an on-treatment biopsy in participants with
      non-small cell lung cancer who are receiving standard treatment with a drug that targets the
      PD-1 or PD-L1 protein.

    <intervention_name>Pre-Treatment Biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants screened for participation will include those with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC who have undergone a pre-treatment biopsy prior to start of therapy with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor or who are medically able to undergo a biopsy if (1) no pre-treatment biopsy has been obtained and (2) no PD-(L)1 inhibitor has been started.</description>

    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>On-Treatment Biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>All participants who receive at least 1 dose of PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be referred for a biopsy. The biopsy should be obtained within 4 weeks of first on-treatment imaging (usually performed ~6-9 weeks after beginning therapy) and will be performed in participants regardless of radiologic response.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Biopsy at Disease Progression</intervention_name>
    <description>All participants who develop disease progression after initial response to PD-(L)1 blockade will be considered for an additional, optional biopsy. Biopsies at disease progression are often obtained per standard of care within 4 weeks of documented progression on imaging and prior to the initiation of further systemic therapy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Peripheral Blood-Based Studies</intervention_name>
    <description>All participants will have peripheral blood obtained on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 (0, 3, 6, and 9 weeks). At each time point, peripheral blood sample will be collected pre-treatment and used for analysis of T cell subsets and TCR sequencing.</description>
