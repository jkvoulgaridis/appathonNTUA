  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To document usage of the Urovac device among 30 initial users of the device in an acute
      rehabilitation facility, with analysis of whether and how patients benefitted, challenges
      encountered, and how benefits and challenges varied by patient type.

      The Urovac device holds the promise of improving care for many of these patients in a manner
      that may also significantly decrease costs. The aim of the study is to determine if this
      device may increase quality of life for patients by reducing urine spills, reducing falls by
      avoiding urgent situations where patients try to ambulate to the bathroom to avoid wetting
      sheets, reducing skin breakdown by avoiding urine spills, reducing excoriation of the glans
      penis, and reducing urinary tract infections.

      The Urovac is simply a regular plastic handheld urinal attached by tubing to a pump that
      evacuates urine to a reservoir. There is also a removable cloth-covered platform to reduce
      spills. Allowing for the evacuation of urine from the urinal significantly improves its
      functionality. The Urovac can be left in place without risk of overflow or other spillage,
      such that a patient with UI requires less assistance. Improving the handheld urinal in this
      manner should thus allow for reduced usage of diapers, catheterization, and
      institutionalization. For patients with UI requiring hospitalization or institutionalization
      for other reasons, the Urovac could potentially reduce the associated labor and complication
      costs. Despite the clear clinical promise of the Urovac, it has only been used by a small
      number of patients to date. This study will document usage of the Urovac among 30 of the
      initial users of the device to better understand the benefits and challenges.
