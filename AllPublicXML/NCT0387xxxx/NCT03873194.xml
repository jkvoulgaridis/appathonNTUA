  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy relates to arterial hypertension; it is an aggravating factor for pre-existing
      chronic arterial hypertension or a trigger for preeclampsia in normotensive women. The
      gestational hypertensive disease is managed conventionally with the pregnant woman's
      hospitalization and/or the use of antihypertensive medications. Nevertheless, this treatment
      may present some risks. The investigators seek to determine whether the intervention compared
      to the control can reduce the increase in blood pressure that pregnant women in the
      transition from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester.

    <intervention_model_description>The objective of this study is assess the effect of meditation as a complementary therapy in hypertensive pregnant women.
The method used will be a randomized, controlled and blinded clinical trial, where meditation is going to be offered between March 2019 and July 2020 at the Obstetrics Clinic of Hospital of Clinics, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo. Patients are going to be randomly assigned to two groups: Group I, patients who are going to practice meditation and Group II, patients that will receive only the usual outpatient care.
The allocation will be performed according to CONSORT criteria and sequential within two classifications of diastolic blood pressure values.
Differences between the means of the variables (blood pressure levels and questionnaires about life quality, anxiety, resilience and mindfulness) will be compared between the groups. Values of p&lt;0,05 will be considered significant.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Blinding will be used in the following manner: after informed consent, an auxiliary researcher will randomly allocate participants to 2 research groups (Group A or Group B). After this step, the auxiliary researcher will collect data for the study and will refer the patient for the usual treatment or for the usual treatment and also meditation.
The lead researcher will not have access to the data that was collected at the beginning of the study by the auxiliary researcher before the end of the intervention step. He will analyse the results without knowing which patients were in which group (A or B). Only after statistical analysis the groups composition will be revealed.</masking_description>

    <measure>Assessment of quality of life with World Health Organization instrument for evaluating quality of life (Whoqol-bref) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Checking potential increases or decreases in the quality life indicator during pregnancy using the Whoqol-Bref questionnaire as a result measure.
The questionnaire will be applied at the entrance of the participant in the study and at the end of the 8 weeks.
This questionnaire is composed of four domains of quality of life, totaling 24 questions.
The answers follow a Likert scale (from 1 to 5) and the domain scores for the WHOQOL-BREF were calculated by multiplying the mean of all items included within the domain by four. Potential scores for all domain scores, therefore, range from 4-20.
Only the total quality of life score will be considered in this study. For this study, a larger score on the Whoqol-Bref demonstrates a better outcome for the group performing the meditation intervention.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of anxiety and depression with The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Checking potential increase or decreases of anxiety and depression indicators during pregnancy using the HADS Scale as a result measure.
The questionnaire will be applied at the entrance of the participant in the study and at the end of the 8 weeks.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) consist of 14 questions. It was divided into an Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) consist of 07 questions and a Depression subscale (HADS-D) consist of 07 questions both containing seven intermingled items.
Each items can be scored from zero (0) to three (3), composing a maximum score of 21 points for each sub-scale.
HAD-anxiety: no anxiety from 0 to 8, with anxiety ≥ 9;
HAD-depression: without depression from 0 to 8, with depression ≥ 9.
For this study, a larger score on the Resilience Scale demonstrates a worst outcome for the group performing the meditation intervention.</description>

    <description>Checking potential increase or decreases of the capacity to adapt and restore equilibrium to their lives and avoid the potentially deleterious effects of stress, during pregnancy using the Resilience Scale as a result measure.
The questionnaire will be applied at the entrance of the participant in the study and at the end of the 8 weeks.
The Resilience Scale is the scale that consist of 25 questions concerning the capacity to adapt and restore equilibrium to their lives to be rated on a 7-point scale
The Likert scale ranged from (1) disagree to (7) agree, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of trait mindfulness.
Possible scores range from 25 to 175 with higher scores reflecting higher resilience.
For this study, a larger score on the Resilience Scale demonstrates a better outcome for the group performing the meditation intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will be instructed to find a comfortable position, with a straight back, feeling the general state of their bodies (tensions, pains, heat, cold, etc.), to relax and pay attention to their own breathing, being aware of the air that gets into and out of the lungs. The women will be told that whenever their attention disperses (to another focus such as a thought, a sound, a body sensation, a judgment, etc.) they should go back to the original focus (breathing) with no feeling/judgment about the loss of focus. The practice involves focus and attention exercises and the gradual insertion of other anchors (focus points) as participants improve their skills in this practice.</description>

    <description>Early prenatal care, when possible, is recommended as the first measure. Prenatal appointments usually take place fortnightly or weekly for hypertensive pregnant women. Extensive lab testing including specific tests for the first trimester, as well as tests for the diagnosis of superimposed pre-eclampsia and for the evaluation of lesions in target organs.
Drug treatment is only used when non-drug measures against hypertension are inefficient to decrease blood pressure levels and diastolic pressure is 90 mmHg or higher (in the first half of pregnancy) and over 100 mmHg (after 20 weeks).</description>
