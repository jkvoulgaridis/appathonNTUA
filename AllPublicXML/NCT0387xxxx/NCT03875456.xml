  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cephalohematoma is a common pathology of newborns. Observation is the primary treatment
      for the most of small uncomplicated cephalohematoma. However large cephalohematoma can lead
      to calcification with anesthetic local deformation or deformational plagiocephaly. The
      objective of the study was to evaluate the iatrogenic risk associated with early puncture on
      local anesthesia.

      This is a retrospective study of 67 newborns followed at the University Hospital of
      Montpellier between 2010 and 2017. Treatment was puncture under local anesthesia between 2
      and 4 weeks of life.

      Any potential complication events were searched retrospectively during the month after the
      puncture. Analyze of the electronic medical record was made as followed: read of
      peri-operative and post-operative reports, looking for readmission in Pediatric Emergency
      department and finally read of the report of the clinical control 1 month after the procedure
