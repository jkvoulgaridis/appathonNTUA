  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, dose escalation, Phase I trial of the
      combination of the FAK inhibitor, VS-6063, and the dual RAF/MEK inhibitor, RO5126766 in
      patients with advanced solid tumours. RO5126766 is the same compound to CH5126766.

      There are two parts to this study, the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase. In
      the dose escalation phase, cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). This will be followed by a
      dose expansion phase to further characterise the safety and tolerability and to assess the
      pharmacodynamic activity of the combination.

      This is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, dose escalation, Phase I trial of the
      combination of the FAK inhibitor, VS-6063, and the dual RAF/MEK inhibitor, RO5126766 in
      patients with advanced solid tumours. RO5126766 is the same compound to CH5126766.

      There are two parts to this study, the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase. In
      the dose escalation phase, cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Up to 24 patients with
      solid tumours will be treated in the dose escalation phase of this study.

      This will be followed by a dose expansion phase of 56 patients to further characterise the
      safety and tolerability and to assess the pharmacodynamic activity of the combination.

      The dose expansion phase will be made up of 4 cohorts: 20 patients with KRAS mutant
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 6 patients with solid tumours (enriched for those with
      RAS mutations) willing to undergo biopsies at three time points throughout the study; 20
      patients with low grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) and 10 patients with colorectal cancer
      (CRC) that have consented.

      Patients will take the two investigational medicinal products (IMPs) as follows:

      RO5126766 will be administered orally twice a week on Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday at
      least one hour prior or two hours after a meal. The starting dose of RO5126766 will be 3.2mg
      once a day, twice a week and can be escalated to a maximum of 4mg once a day, twice a week.

      VS-6063 will be administered orally twice a day immediately after a meal. The starting dose
      of VS-6063 will be 200mg twice daily and can be escalated to a maximum of 400mg twice daily.

      A cycle length is 4 weeks (28 days). Combination dosing (RO5126766 and VS-6063) will commence
      on Cycle 1 Day 1 for 3 weeks followed by one week without either drug in week 4 (i.e. 3 weeks
      on, 1 week off).

      For patients consenting to optional biopsies, a run-in dose of RO5126766 will be administered
      on a single day anywhere between Days -7 to Day -3 in order to facilitate pharmacodynamic
      (PD) biomarker analysis. Therefore, for patients undergoing biopsies the first cycle will be
      5 weeks long and subsequent cycles will consist of 4 weeks.

      If this schedule is not tolerated, alternative schedules may be explored following discussion
      by the Safety Review Committee.

          3. Known untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (progressing or
             requiring corticosteroids for symptomatic control). Patients with a history of treated

               -  Radiographic demonstration of improvement upon the completion of CNS-directed
                  therapy and no evidence of interim progression between the completion of

             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree
             to use two medically approved forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal contraception and condom, have an intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm
             with spermicidal gel and condom) from time of consent, during the trial and for six

             measures not to father children by using one form of medically approved contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or
             neonate.

          6. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to entry to the study (excluding placement of
             vascular access), or minor surgery within 2 weeks of entry into the study and from
             which the patient has not yet recovered.

          7. Treatment with warfarin. Patients on warfarin for DVT/PE can be converted to LMWH.

         11. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         12. Patients with the inability to swallow oral medications or impaired gastrointestinal
             absorption due to gastrectomy or active inflammatory bowel disease.

         13. Concurrent ocular disorders:

               1. Patients with history of glaucoma, history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO),
                  predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled
                  diabetes

               2. Patient with history of retinal pathology or evidence of visible retinal
                  pathology that is considered a risk factor for RVO, intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mm
                  Hg as measured by tonometry, or other significant ocular pathology, such as
                  anatomical abnormalities that increase the risk for RVO.

               3. Patients with a history of corneal erosion (instability of corneal epithelium),
                  corneal degeneration, active or recurrent keratitis, and other forms of serious
                  ocular surface inflammatory conditions.

         14. Concurrent congestive heart failure, prior history of class III/ IV cardiac disease
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] - refer to Appendix 4), myocardial infarction

             the first dose.

             N.B. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information.

         16. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of RO5126766 in combination with VS-6063.
             Participation in an observational trial would be acceptable.

         17. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
