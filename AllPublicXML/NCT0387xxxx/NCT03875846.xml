  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether intraoperative physiologic measurements of blood flow to
      the leg during endovascular treatment of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) can predict future
      clinical outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) caused by atherosclerosis can cause cause
      leg pain, gangrene, and limb loss. PAD is a result of poor blood flow to the extremity, and
      the emerging most common initial method of interventional treatment is endovascular therapy,
      for example angioplasty or stenting. The poor blood flow to the extremity can be inferred by
      the hemodynamic pressure of blood in the leg. These toe or ankle pressure measurements are
      typically performed before surgery to diagnose PAD, and after surgery as surveillance.

      However, endovascular treatment has a high failure rate often exceeding 20% within a year.
      There is evidence that physiologic measurements prior to treatment and after treatment are
      closely related to clinical outcomes. This study introduces these physiologic measurements to
      the operating room, to determine if physiologic improvement can be detected instantaneously
      during endovascular revascularization. Patients will be followed for a year following surgery
      to detect hemodynamic and clinical outcomes. The rationale of these intraoperative
      measurements would be to potentially guide future surgery, by providing real-time hemodynamic
      feedback to the operator.
