  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled study designed to assess whether digital virtual
      reality (VR) models, created from existing CT scans and MRIs, provide surgeons with an
      improved understanding of their patients' anatomy, resulting in more efficient operations
      (robotic prostatectomy) and improved patient care.
