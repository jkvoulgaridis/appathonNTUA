      Study assessing efficacy and safety of concomitantly dosed naproxen sodium with
      acetaminophen, compared with naproxen sodium, hydrocodone/acetaminophen and Placebo in a
      postoperative dental pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group study to
      evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of concomitantly administered naproxen sodium 440
      mg with acetaminophen 1000 mg and concomitantly administered naproxen sodium 220 mg with
      acetaminophen 650 mg, compared with a fixed combination of hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen
      650 mg, naproxen sodium 440 mg, and placebo over a twelve-hour period after surgical
      extraction of four third molars.
