  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are: 1) to identify biomarkers using neuroimaging that are associated
      with progression rate using statistical methods, and 2) to identify biomarkers that are
      associated with the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of patients with parkinsonian symptoms has two critical gaps: (1) there are no
      clinically accepted biomarkers that may be used to inform disease progression rate in an
      individual with Parkinson disease (PD), and (2) no biomarkers exist to inform differential
      diagnosis of conditions that exhibit parkinsonian symptoms and signs. This 2-year study aims
      to develop a multi-modal neuroimaging biomarker that enables the prediction of disease
      progression rate in PD, and a biomarker that enables the differential diagnosis of PD,
      multiple systems atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and healthy controls.

      This study consists of two parts; neuroimaging of a defined population of mid to late stage
      PD subjects currently followed at UT Southwestern Medical Center, and recruitment of new
      subjects with PD, MSA, and PSP who will be followed clinically over 2 years and who will
      undergo neuroimaging.

      Participants will be asked to undergo several types of neuroimaging which will be analyzed
      using machine learning techniques.

      At each study visit of the newly recruited cohorts, appropriate clinical scales will be
      performed based on their diagnosis and used to track and measure disease severity and
      progression.

    <measure>Change from baseline in MDS-UPDRS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 Month Visit, End of Study Visit (12-16 Month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Disorder Society revision of the Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is the standard measure of PD severity used in multiple trials. This consists of four sub scales, Part I: non-motor experiences of daily living (13 items), Part ll: motor experiences of daily living (13 items), Part III: motor examination (18 items), and Part IV: motor complications (six items). Each subscale has a ﬁve-point scale ranging from 0-4, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The total score is the sum of the subscale scores for all four parts and ranges from 0 (no disability) to 200 (total dependence). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Uniﬁed Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 Month Visit, End of Study Visit (12-16 Month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Uniﬁed Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) is the standard scale for measuring disease severity in MSA. This scale is composed of 2 sub-scales: Part I: Historical Review that includes 12 items and Part II: Motor Examination that includes 14 items. All items range from 0 to 4. Each subscale score is the sum of its items and the total UMSARS score is the sum of all 26 items. Hence the total UMSARS score can range from 0 to 104, with 0 meaning no impairment and 104 indicating severe impairment. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 Month Visit, End of Study Visit (12-16 Month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Scale (PSPRS) is the standard scale used to quantitate severity in PSP. This is a quantitative measure of disability in participants with PSP. The PSPRS comprises 28 items in 6 areas. The available total score ranges from 0 (normal) to 100. Six items are rated on a 3-point scale (0-2) and 22 are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). The History/Daily Activities area includes 7 items with ta total maximum of 24 points, the mentation area 4 items with 16 points, the bulbar area 2 items with 8 points, the ocular motor area 4 items with 16 points, the limb motor area 6 items with 16 points, and the gait area 5 items with 20 points. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 Month Visit, End of Study Visit (12-16 Month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) assesses to what degree PD subjects experience difficulties across 8 dimensions of daily living. The 39-question PDQ provides scores (expressed as a percentage) for each of the 8 scales: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. individual items are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). Higher percentages represent worse quality of life, and a reduction in score over time represents improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 Month Visit, End of Study Visit (12-16 Month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (S&amp;E) is a commonly used measure of daily function for Parkinson's disease (PD). The S&amp;E Scale rates a PD patient's function on a scale from 0 indicating worst possible function to 100 indicating no impairment. An increase in the score over time indicates clinical improvement.</description>

    <description>For Aim 2, we will recruit subjects with PD, MSA, and PSP. We will also recruit healthy age/sex-matched controls. All subjects will complete a series of clinical assessments at three different time points, roughly 6-8 months apart:
Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose
Parkinson disease questionnaire
Schwab and England ADL Scale
MDS-UPDRS (PD and healthy controls only)
UMSARS (MSA subjects only)
