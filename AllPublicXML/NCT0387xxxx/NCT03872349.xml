  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overaccumulation of apolipoprotein (apo)B-48-containing lipoproteins of intestinal origin
      observed in patients with insulin-resistance is now thought to be attributable to both
      elevated intestinal production and reduced clearance of these lipoproteins. Substantial
      evidence exists indicating that elevated plasma levels of these lipoproteins are associated
      with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Therefore, reduction of atherogenic plasma
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins à (TRL) levels of intestinal origin appears to be crucial to
      improve CVD risk associated with insulin-resistance. In this regard, there is some evidence
      that the clinical recommendation to replace dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) by
      monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) reduces CVD risk in the general population. Although the
      beneficial impact of PUFAs on CVD risk has been related primarily to favorable changes in
      plasma LDL-cholesterol levels, recent data suggest that chronic MUFA consumption may also
      exert beneficial effects on CVD risk by reducing postprandial lipemia. The impact of
      substituting SFAs by MUFAs on postprandial lipid response may be of even greater significance
      in dyslipidemic patients with insulin-resistance among whom intestinal TRLs represent a large
      proportion of the atherogenic lipoproteins. The general objective of the proposed research is
      to investigate how dietary MUFAs in place of SFAs modify intestinal lipoprotein metabolism in
      men and women with dyslipidemia associated with insulin-resistance. The investigators
      hypothesize that the intestinal secretion of apoB-48-containing lipoproteins will be lower
      following a diet rich in MUFAs than after consuming a diet rich in SFAs. The investigators
      also hypothesize that substitution of SFAs by MUFAs will be associated with significant
      alterations in expression of key genes and proteins involved in intestinal lipoprotein
      metabolism.
