  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the long-term safety and hemostatic efficacy of recombinant von
      Willebrand factor (rVWF) (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis in adult and pediatric participants (aged
      12 to &lt;18 years) with severe von Willebrand disease (VWD) with the option of once weekly
      dosing, and to further assess the safety and efficacy of rVWF in on-demand (OD) treatment of
      bleeding episodes, and in perioperative management of surgical bleeding.

      22 JUN 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the
      COVID-10 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries/sites, and the study is now again
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of
      new patients due to the pandemic.

        episodes or acute illness (eg, influenza, flu-like syndrome, allergic
        rhinitis/conjunctivitis, and non-seasonal asthma) the screening visit will be postponed
        until the participant has recovered. For all other participants, end of study (EOS) visit
        for 071102 or 071301 will be completed per protocol and the completed EOS in Study 071102
        or 071301 will also serve as the screening visit for this continuation study (SHP677-304).
