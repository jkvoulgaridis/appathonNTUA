  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 316 subjects with a wide spectrum of PCI indications
      (stable angina as well as ACS), who are considered to be at high risk of bleeding. Patients
      will undergo PCI with implantation of the EluNIR stent, followed by shortened duration (1
      months in stable patients, and up to 3 months in ACS patients) of DAPT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center (Up to 20 sites), single-arm, open-label post marketing
      clinical trial.

      The objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of shortened DAPT duration (30 days in
      stable patients and up to 90 days in ACS patients) following PCI using the EluNIR stent, in
      patients considered to be at high bleeding risk (HBR).

      Patients will be enrolled to the study prior to the PCI procedure.Once a patient has signed
      an informed consent, met all general and angiographic eligibility criteria, and a guidewire
      has successfully been passed beyond the target lesion and lesion preparation (if indicated)
      completed, the patient will be enrolled into the trial.Data collection commences after the
      subject has signed the informed consent form. Data collection including subject demographic
      information, laboratory tests, and procedural data as well as follow-up visits or telephone
      contacts will be captured by the Investigator or site coordinator who has been trained on the
      CIP and Case Report Forms (CRF).

      After discharge from the hospital, each subject will be followed with an in-clinic follow-up
      visit at 30 days, and follow-up by phone at 6 months and 1year post procedure. Patients with
      recurrent ischemic events within the first 30 days as well as patients in whom the initial
      presentation was ACS and in whom the investigator has decided to continue DAPT beyond 30 days
      will have an additional phone follow-up at 3 months.

      The clinical investigation will last for the expected duration of each subject's
      participation.

      Each subject will remain in the clinical investigation for approximately 1 year from the time
      of the study stent implantation until the last follow-up telephone contact.

      The trial population will consist of approximately 316 male and female subjects undergoing
      PCI for angina (stable or unstable), silent ischemia, non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) considered
      at HBR.

    <description>DAPT will be stopped at 30 days in non-ACS subjects while at ACS Patients it may be maintained for up to 3 months. In patients with ACS or with an ischemic event during the first 30 days, DAPT may be continued at the discretion of the investigator. In ACS patients DAPT should be continued for a maximum of 3 months. For patients with recurrent ischemic events duration of DAPT therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation with either a Vitamin K inhibitor or a NOAC/DOAC will receive either single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel, or DAPT for 30 days (triple therapy) followed by single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel (75 mg QD) will be given to these patients post procedure for 6 months in stable patients and 12 months in ACS patients.</description>
