  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of an experimental drug PC945 in people with cystic fibrosis
      whose lungs are infected by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.

      PC945 may be useful in treating patients infected with Aspergillus fumigatus as, unlike the
      usual treatments, it is inhaled into the lung and has been designed to stay there and treat
      the infection. Participants will continue to be treated with their usual cystic fibrosis
      treatment and will also receive PC945. The amount of fungus in the patients' phlegm will be
      measured over the course of the study. The study will take place at multiple sites in UK and
      will include approximately 18 participants. The maximum study duration will be about 16
      weeks.
