    <textblock>
      The non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS) can avoid intubation-related
      complications and for a smoother postoperative recovery. Successful results are accumulating
      not only from anecdotal case reports of difficult and high-risk patients not suitable for an
      intubated general anesthesia. However, in spite of safety and feasibility, there were still
      three main concerns: 1. how to maintain spontaneous breathing with optimal anesthetic depth;
      2. How to analyze the components of general anesthesia and regional anesthesia; 3.what's the
      benefits on the recovery and the risk of aspiration risk with NIVATS? The traditional monitor
      or methods such as BIS system, SpO2, and follow-up aspiration signs could not offer
      sufficient evidence to resolve the three main concerns. Recently, there have been many new
      methods to monitor these concerns. The density spectral array (DSA) BIS system could analyze
      the change of the anesthetic component. The ORI is a dimensionless index that reflects
      oxygenation in the moderate hyperoxic range (PaO2 100-200 mmHg).

      Background: The non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (NIVATS) can avoid
      intubation-related complications and for a smoother postoperative recovery. In recent years,
      investigator have completed more than 1000 NIVATS. However, the benefits on recovery
      including swallowing and esophageal function have nerver been demonstrated. The anesthetic
      components include an intravenous general anesthesia with an intraoperative nerve blocks.
      Monitoring and analyzing the components of anesthesia have rarely been studied. In this
      study, the investigator plan to do a radomized control study to demonstarte the differences
      between NIVATS and intubated VATS, and to investigate the differences on recovery and
      anesthetic components. Patients schedured for VATS operation, suitable for NIVATS will be
      included and randomized into NIVATS or VATS groups. DSA and Ce will be monitored throughout
      the surgical procedures. swalowing test, esophageal function and postoperative qustionare for
      food intake will be recorded, collected and analyzed.
