  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A third of people over 65, and half of people over 80, fall at least once a year. Falls are
      the most common cause of death from injury in the over 65s and result in a significant
      financial burden on the whole society. Shoes directly influence balance, gait, and the
      subsequent risk of slips, trips and falls by altering somatosensory feedback to the foot and
      ankle. Minimal shoes, that is shoes lacking a firm heel cup, a rigid sole or longitudinal
      arch support, have shown advantages in strengthening muscles and improving balance as
      compared to conventional shoes. However, limited research has studied the effect of minimal
      shoe in older people at risk of falls. The aim of the project will be to assess the effects
      of minimal shoes in older people at risk of falls, compared to conventional shoes and
      barefoot.

      Study participants will attend a one-day testing session at the Movement Laboratory,
      University of Liverpool. Participants will be subjected to several standing and walking tests
      while wearing three types of footwear in a randomised order: (i) a minimal shoe, (ii) a
      conventional shoe, and (iii) barefoot. Participants' physical function, stability during
      standing and walking and an activity of lower leg muscles will be assessed in each of those
      three footwear conditions. Participants will also be asked about perceptions of footwear,
      regarding a minimal shoe and a conventional shoe. At the end of assessments, participants
      will be asked to complete several walking bouts while wearing a minimal shoe with &quot;smart&quot;
      shoe insoles, to determine &quot;smart&quot; insoles' validity in obtaining gait characteristics
      against a gold standard measure. Finally, those participants who volunteer to take part in a
      two-week follow-up study, will be asked to wear the minimal shoes with &quot;smart&quot; insoles during
      daily life for two weeks, After two weeks, they will be asked to fill in an online
      questionnaire asking them about total time they used the minimal shoes and insoles and about
      how satisfied they were with them.
