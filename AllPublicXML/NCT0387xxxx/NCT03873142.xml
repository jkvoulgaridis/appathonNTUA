    <textblock>
      This study investigates the impact of a mindful parenting intervention on parents of children
      with psoriasis or eczema. More specifically, this study will investigate the impact of the
      group on both the child and the parents mental health and quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis and eczema are chronic inflammatory skin conditions that affect up to 2% and 20% of
      children respectively (Mahe, 2016; Plötz, Wiesender, Todorva &amp; Ring, 2014). These skin
      conditions are associated with poorer mental health in the children themselves and in their
      parents (Megna et al., 2015; Hammer-Helmich et al., 2016). Little research has investigated
      ways of reducing parental stress in parents of children with chronic health conditions, such
      as psoriasis and eczema.

      &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot; interventions offer one potential way of improving mental health and
      quality of life in parents and their children. Mindful parenting refers to a parenting style
      which involves paying close, non-judgemental attention to the child (Duncan et al., 2009).
      However, no research has investigated the impact of mindful parenting interventions on
      children with skin conditions and their parents.

      The main aim of the current study is to investigate whether a mindful parenting intervention
      can improve mental health and quality of life in children with psoriasis/eczema and their
      parents. A single-group case-series design will be adopted, whereby participants will act as
      their own control; data collected from participants during and after they have received the
      intervention will be compared to data collected before they have received the intervention.
      Interviews will also be conducted after the intervention, to explore participants experience
      of the group.

      The investigators predict that the intervention will improve mental health and quality of
      life in children with psoriasis/eczema and their parents. More specifically, we predict:

        -  There will be a reduction in negative parental idiosyncratic measures of stress
           throughout the intervention phase, in comparison to baseline phase, that will be
           maintained in the follow-up phase.

        -  There will be an improvement in positive parental idiosyncratic measures of stress
           during the intervention phase in comparison to baseline phase that will be maintained in
           the follow-up phase.

        -  There will be a significant increase in levels of mindful parenting following the
           intervention phase, in comparison to baseline phase, that will be maintained in the
           follow-up phase.

        -  There will be a significant decrease in levels of parental stress at end of intervention
           phase compared to baseline phase that will be maintained in the follow-up phase.

        -  There will be a significant increase in parental quality of life and paediatric quality
           of life at the end of intervention phase compared to baseline phase that will be
           maintained in the follow-up phase .

        -  There will be a significant improvement in psoriasis severity and itch at the follow-up
           phase compared to the baseline phase.

    <description>The primary outcome measures for the proposed study are idiosyncratic measures of stress which will be assessed daily by text message. Participants will be asked to identify one stress-related positive target (something the participant would like to improve) and one negative target (something the participant would like to reduce). Participants will respond to the daily text messages with a score on a 0-100 scale.</description>

    <description>The Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting scale (IM-P; Duncan, 2007) will be used to ascertain the level of mindful parenting of the parents. This self-report questionnaire measures affective, cognitive and attitudinal aspects of parent-child relationships. There are 10 items covering one higher order mindful parenting factor and four first-order factors: 1) present-centered attention in parenting; 2) present-centered emotional awareness in parenting; 3) non-reactivity/low-reactivity in parenting; and 4) non-judgmental acceptance in parenting. Items are rated on five-point Likert scales (from &quot;never true&quot; to &quot;always true&quot;).</description>

This self-report measure comprises 10 items assessing a range of ways that a family member's skin condition may impact upon an individual's quality of life, covering two factors (psychosocial impact and physical impact). Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;).</description>

    <description>There is only one arm in this study. A range of variables will first be measured (daily and weekly) over a baseline period in a group of participants. Following this baseline period, participants will be take part in a mindful parenting intervention whilst the same variables are measured. Following the intervention, there will be an 8-week follow-up period, and mindful parenting groups will not run during this time.</description>

    <description>The mindful parenting intervention is an adaption for parents of the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for depression (Kabat-Zinn, 1990), and the Mindful-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1990). The mindful parenting intervention will follow the manual developed by Bögels and Restifo (2014). The intervention consists of 9x3hour sessions. Eight of these sessions are run on consecutive weeks and the final session is run eight weeks after the eighth session. These groups involve group discussions around parenting, meditation exercises, and yoga, amongst other things.</description>
