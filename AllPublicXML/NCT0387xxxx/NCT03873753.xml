  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known regarding the effectiveness of neonatal oral hygiene and its relationship to
      colonization by Candida spp. in edentulous oral cavities. Thus, the objective of this study
      is to evaluate whether the oral hygiene of edentulous infants favors colonization by Candida
      spp. Newborns with up to 48 hours of life will randomly allocated to two groups. The mothers
      will instructed to clean the oral cavity with gauze and mineral water three times a day, in
      the test group, and not to clean, in the control group.
