  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defunctioning ileostomy has demonstrated its benefits (rate and seriousness of anastomotic
      leakage) in cancer for low colorectal and coloanal anastomoses, whereas there are no such
      good quality evidences in case of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) performed for
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, most surgical teams do protect systematically IPAA
      by an ileostomy.

      Total proctocolectomy with IPAA is the gold standard for surgical management of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). This demanding procedure is often performed in 2 or 3 stages, namely subtotal
      colectomy, completion proctectomy with IPAA and defunctioning ileostomy closure. Subtotal
      colectomy with double stoma is first performed to allow nutritional support, reduce
      inflammation and stop immunosuppressive agents. Completion proctectomy with IPAA is then
      performed on a healthier patient. Hence, the need for a systematic defunctioning ileostomy is
      questioned. No study addressed specifically the question of completion proctectomy, whereas
      it concerns 36% to 42% of patients undergoing IPAA. Globally, the overall 6-month morbidity
      rate is 55% in case of stoma creation vs. 30% otherwise in IPAA.

      Moreover, defunctioning ileostomy has several drawbacks including an additional surgical
      procedure (stoma closure), a worse quality of life before closure, and the risk of
      dehydration that may require readmission. Following stoma closure, the risk of anastomotic
      leakage is around 4%. Overall, during the stoma period, 8% of patients will require
      reoperation. Finally, the risk of incisional hernia is 15-20% at the ex-ileostomy site.

      Therefore, the aim of this trial is to assess the need for a systematic defunctioning
      ileostomy after completion proctectomy with IPAA.
