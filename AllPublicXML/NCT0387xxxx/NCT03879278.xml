  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single center, placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) study in a maximum of 3 cohorts of 8 healthy male and female subjects
      each. Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 will receive ascending multiple IV doses of NPT189 or
      matching placebo.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, dose
      escalation safety, tolerability and PK study of NPT189 in healthy subjects. Three dose
      cohorts are planned each with a maximum of 8 subjects (6 active: 2 placebo) enrolled per
      cohort. Eligible subjects will be administered NPT189 by IV infusions at the dose specified
      for their cohort (i.e., 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg) or a matching placebo. Subjects
      will receive a total of 5 doses of NPT189, with doses administered at weekly intervals.
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by analysis of adverse events (AEs), vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECG), laboratory and physical examinations. PK will be assessed by
      analysis of serum NPT189 concentrations.
