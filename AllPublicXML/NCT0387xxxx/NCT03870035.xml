    <textblock>
      -  Nesfatin-1 is an 82-amino acid polypeptide derived from the nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2)
           precursor proteins.

        -  It is a newly identified peptide. It is released from several tissues including
           forebrain, hindbrain, brainstem, spinal cord and adipose tissues.

        -  It plays an important role in hypothalamic pathways such as feeding inhibition,
           locomotion, stress modulation, thermogenesis, and reproduction.

        -  Several studies had demonstrated that nesfatin-1 associated with body mass index (BMI),
           insulin resistance and inflammatory response disorders.

        -  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of infertility in
           women. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, multiple ovarian cysts,
           oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Many mechanisms had been reported to be responsible for the
           pathophysiology of PCOS. The condition is thought to be interactions between
           hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and metabolic
           disorders.

        -  The circulating level of nesfatin-1 in PCOS patients is controversial. Some studies
           reveal lower nesfatin-1 serum levels while others reveal higher level.

        -  Women with PCOS may have reduced dopamine production from the hypothalamus and elevated
           prolactin concentrations and this mechanism may be responsible for reproductive
           disorder.

        -  In PCOS, stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from mononuclear cells
           (MNCs) by hyperglycemia . The superoxide radical in particular is a ROS that is
           generated by the activity of membrane-bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
           (NADPH) oxidase.

        -  Dopaminergic (DA) neurons are highly susceptible to ROS. DA is relatively unstable
           molecule and undergoes auto-oxidative metabolism in nigro striatal tract system, leading
           to ROS production. Nicotinamide can reduce hypothalamic dopamine in postnatal brains
           results in dopamine-deficient phenotypes. Nicotinamide prevents DA release induced by
           long-term perinatal asphyxia.

        The PCOS patients included in this study will be selected from out patient's clinic of the
        department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Assiut university hospital, Assiut, Egypt,
        during one year after the study begins. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient
        before the examination after explaining the aim of the study to each participant, and the
        study will be approved by the ethical committee of our institution. The gathered
        demographic information and complete data will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PCOS patients in the age range 18 - 40 years old.

          -  Diagnosis of PCOS is based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM diagnostic criteria, according to
             which patients who had at least two of the following conditions are accepted as having
             PCOS:

               1. Oligo or anovulation, defined by the presence of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea,
                  confirmed by luteal progesterone and normal serum follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) levels (1.0-10.0 IU/L).

               2. Clinical hyperandrogenism signs which was defined as the presence of at least one
                  of the following three features: hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia.
                  Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined as a serum testosterone (T) level &gt;60
                  ng/dL (&gt;2.08 nmol/L).

               3. PCOS manifestation was defined as the presence of &gt;12 unilateral follicles 2-9 mm
                  in size on the ovary or having the least unilateral ovary volume of 10 cm3 by
                  ultrasonography (the measurement was performed when there was no follicle &gt;10
                  mm). Ovarian volume was calculated by the formula [0.5× ovarian length ×
                  thickness × width]. In the case of transabdominal ultrasonography, the presence
                  of at least 10 unilateral antral follicles was required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (age &lt;18 or &gt; 40years),

          -  Other endocrinology diseases as diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorders, Brain
             disorders as pituitary adenoma or tumour or brain tumours or masses,

             hypertension, and cancer,
