  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study (including patients with an intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric
      fractures type 31A1, 31A2 and 31A3) is to assess the effect of an educational intervention
      for operating surgeons with respect to an improvement of the quality of reduction and
      internal stabilisation of intertrochanteric fractures. A historic cohort of patients operated
      at the University Hospital Basel for an intertrochanteric fracture from 2014-2015 will be
      used for comparison.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intertrochanteric fractures are one of the most frequent fracture type in the elderly
      population usually occurring in patients older than 60 years of age. Almost all fractures are
      treated operatively with reduction and stabilisation of the fracture using either a dynamic
      hip screw or an intramedullary nail. The reduction of the fracture and positioning of the
      implant are surgeon dependent factors and can be influenced by educational interventions. The
      investigators hypothesized that a structured educational program on the optimal use of
      intraoperative fluoroscopy to control the quality of reduction and the position of the
      implant, as well as the provision of a practical algorithm intraoperatively guiding reduction
      and stabilisation of intertrochanteric fractures would improve the radiologic outcome.
