  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the use of ProChondrix Cryopreserved
      Osteochondral Allograft to obtain evidence of effectiveness, defined as an improvement in
      physical function and pain, when used on a symptomatic cartilage defect on the femoral
      condyle or patella in a mechanically stable knee.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will use a multi-center, prospective design, to evaluate ProChondrix CR
      in approximately 80 patients who are scheduled to undergo treatment of a cartilage defect on
      the femoral condyle or patella.Patient follow-up will include a period of 60 months after
      surgery. During this follow-up period, each patient will be evaluated seven (7) times at: 3,
      6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after surgical intervention.
