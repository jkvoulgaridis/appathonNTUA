  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the best ways to prevent anxiety and depression in
      older Latino adults who are at risk for developing anxiety and depression. Participants will
      be randomized to either a health promotion intervention or a healthy lifestyles education
      program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the prevalence and morbidity of depression in later life, the inadequacies of current
      treatment approaches for averting years living with disability, the inequities in access to
      the mental health care delivery system, and the workforce shortages to meet the mental health
      needs of older Latinos, development and testing of innovative strategies to prevent
      depression and anxiety are of great public health significance and have the potential to
      change practice.
