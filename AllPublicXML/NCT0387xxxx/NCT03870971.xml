  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, prospective, comparative, multi-center study. All participants will get an
      introduction to the invasive component of the TENSORTIP COG by means of the instructions for
      use in English language only (incl. an illustrated short manual) and will be asked to perform
      a reading without further device training. Thereafter, a healthcare professional will perform
      an additional reading with the reference method (YSI 2300 STAT plus). In addition, blood will
      be drawn for determination of hematocrit. In the study, a minimum of 10 test strip vials that
      cover a minimum of 3 strip lots will be used. In addition multiple devices will be employed.
      After completion of the study the study participants will be given a questionnaire to fill
      out.

    <description>After the patient has performed the manual reading, the investigator or staff member will obtain another capillary blood sample and a reference reading by means of the YSI 2300 Stat plus analyzer will be performed and recorded. If patients need more than one attempt to get a successful blood glucose reading, the number of attempts will be documented. A questionnaire needs to filled by the participant</description>
