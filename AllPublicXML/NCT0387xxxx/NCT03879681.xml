  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting in children is a common phenomenon, particularly after ear
      nose and throat (ENT) surgery. While it affects up to 80% of patients who do not receive
      preventative medication during their operation, more than 1 in 5 children still suffer from
      postoperative nausea and vomiting after tonsillectomy even when given 2 medications to
      prevent it. Nausea and vomiting after an operation (postoperatively) particularly following
      tonsillectomy can be very painful and distressing for the child and their carer. Vomiting may
      also increase the risk of postoperative bleeding, a serious complication after the surgery.
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting is not only one of the main reasons for prolonged hospital
      stay or re-admission in children; it is also one of the main reasons for dissatisfaction with
      anaesthesia in children and their families. In adults, a pilot study has found that chewing
      gum postoperatively can significantly reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. Chewing and
      swallowing, results in increased activity in the gut and lessens the effects of medications
      given under anaesthesia that tend to slow the gut.

      However, for young children particularly following anaesthesia, chewing gum may not be a safe
      option. Therefore, in this pilot study the investigators will investigate if chewing a large
      jelly confectionary snake after the anaesthetic will help to reduce nausea and vomiting. The
      children who are enrolled in the study will be randomised to receive a jelly snake or no
      jelly snake to chew once awake after the surgery. There will be no other changes to the
      standard management which will be in accordance to institutional guidelines. The
      investigators will then compare the rates of vomiting between the children who did and did
      not receive a jelly snake to chew. We will also monitor other oral and food intake and
      requirements for painkillers, as well as for other potential problems (e.g. delayed
      discharge) after surgery.

      The advantage of using a jelly snake is that it is a simple, inexpensive, non-drug treatment.
      Parents are very keen to avoid the use of drugs for their children and so would be open to
      the use of this new approach. For children the jelly snake offers something familiar and an
      enjoyable solution to their discomfort. The use of jelly snakes could also be a simple
      intervention that parents could do at home following day case surgery for other procedures.
      While the jelly snakes are high in sugar, they are comparable to the sugar content of a glass
      of fruit juice, flavoured milk or soft drinks. Generally, in the investigators' experience,
      the willingness of parents to allow their children to receive treats in the postoperative
      period is very high, particularly since all children have a significant time of fasting (at
      least 6 hours, often longer) for solid foods prior to surgery.

      Primary Hypothesis Chewing large jelly snakes will significantly reduce the development of
      postoperative vomiting in paediatric patients in the first 6 hours after volatile
      anaesthetic-based general anaesthesia for tonsillectomies +/- adenoidectomies.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. Jelly snakes will reduce the incidence of nausea in the first 6 hours after
           tonsillectomy +/- adenoidectomy surgery

        2. Jelly snakes will reduce rescue treatments for PONV in the first 6 hours

        3. Jelly snakes will reduce the incidence of PONV in the first 24 hours or up until
           discharge in case of tonsillectomies (whatever occurs first)

        4. Jelly snakes will reduce rescue treatments for PONV in the first 24 hours or up until
           discharge in case of tonsillectomies (whatever occurs first)

      Safety Hypotheses:

      Children will be able to chew and swallow jelly snakes post-surgery. No jelly snake or parts
      thereof will be inhaled in those receiving treatment.

      Aims This pilot study aims to investigate if chewing jelly confectionary snakes after
      tonsillectomies +/- adenoidectomies will significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative
      nausea/vomiting (PONV) in children.

      Study Design One site pilot trial of the effectiveness of chewy jelly snakes in the
      prevention of POV involving the Royal Aberdeen Children Hospital, UK.

    <description>The participants will be randomized by computer generated randomisation to receive either the jelly snake (n=120) or no intervention (n=120) apart from standard institutional management.
All children randomised into the snake group will be offered a chewy jelly snake once alert and cooperative in PACU or on the ward once University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) is 025,26. The UMSS is a simple observational tool that assesses the level of alertness on a five‐point scale ranging from 1 (wide awake) to 5 (unarousable with deep stimulation).
The children randomized into the control group will receive a chewy jelly snake as a treat at discharge.</description>
