    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase I study to be conducted in patients with non-MSI-high
      advanced/metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) or colorectal cancer (CRC) and is
      divided in two Parts.

        -  Dose escalation Part :To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended
           Dose for Phase 2 (RP2D) of Debio1143 when combined with a fixed dose of Pembrolizumab.

        -  Extension Part: To evaluate preliminary efficacy data of the proposed combination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patient wil receive a combinaison of Pembrolizumab and Debio 1143. Pembrolizumab is a
      potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype
      designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.

      Debio 1143 is an investigational, oral monovalent second mitochondrial-derived activator of
      caspases (SMAC) mimetic designed to promote programmed cell death (apoptosis) in tumor cells
      and anti-tumour immunity. By antagonizing the activity of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins
      (IAPs (X-linked IAP [XIAP], cellular IAP 1 [cIAP1], cellular IAP 2 [cIAP2] and
      melanoma-linked IAP [ML-IAP])), Smac mimetics are an interesting treatment approach for
      cancer that may foster better tumor responses to chemo/radiotherapy- and/or immuno-therapy.

      A Dose escalation part (n= up to 18 patients ) aiming to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      and the the Recommended Dose for Phase 2 of the proposed combination. A classical 3+3 design
      will be used with a fixed dose of Pembrolizumab (200 mg, intravenous , to be administered on
      Day 1 of every 3-week cycle i.e. Q3W) and 3 escalating dose level of Debio 1143 administered
      daily for 14 days over a 21-day cycle period.

      There will be a 24-hour delay between the first and subsequent patients enrolled in each DL
      cohort to maximize the safety of enrolled patients.

      An extension part (n=28 patients: 14 patients per cohort) aiming to evaluate the clinical
      activity of the proposed combination.
