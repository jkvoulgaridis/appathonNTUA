  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a preventive, knowledge enhancement and tailored quality building
      intervention to promote development and mental health in 1 and 2 year-olds. Half of the
      participating childcare centers will get the intervention (intervention group) and half will
      get the intervention after 1 year (waitlist-control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mental health problems manifest already in preschool age and continue into middle and late
      childhood. However, research strongly indicates that mental health problems appear even among
      1-2 year olds. Because 80% of Norwegian under 3 years attend childcare, and stay there for
      long hours, interventions targeting caregiver-child interactions may prove an important
      avenue towards universal prevention of mental health problems.

      Since requirements for high quality is not sufficiently met in many Norwegian childcare
      centers today, a cost-efficient, sustainable model of intervention is called for to enhance
      and track the quality of childcare for 1-3 year olds. The investigators in the study will
      break new grounds by, conducting a cluster randomized control trial of a newly developed
      comprehensive intervention for promoting mental health among toddlers in childcare, the
      Thrive by Three. Because, high quality childcare is in a unique position to prevent
      developmental trajectories leading to mental health problems and to early identify children
      in need of help, effective quality enhancing interventions will be of great value for the
      Norwegian society, both on individual, family, community and national level. The primary
      objective of the project is thus to investigate whether the intervention Thrive by Three will
      improve childcare quality, and strengthen children's mental health and development. It is
      hypothesized that the intervention will prove superior to the wait-list control after the 10
      month intervention period and at 12 months follow-up with respect to childcare quality and
      children's mental health, development and well-being. Our secondary objective is to
      investigate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and whether effects are moderated by
      characteristics of the children, caregivers and/or implementation outcomes. In a subsample of
      approximately 300 children the investigators will sample cortisol at two time points (pre and
      post intervention) to investigate whether quality enhancement alters the cortisol level in
      children in childcare, compared to cortisol secretion at home. User perspectives and
      experience with Thrive by Three will be captured through qualitative interviews.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Classroom Assessment Scoring System - Toddler (CLASS) (la Paro, M., Hamre, B., &amp; Pianta, R., 2012)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 months, 10 months and 22 months (one year follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>CLASS is used to measure change in process quality from pre-intervention (baseline) to half way through the intervention (5 months) period, post-intervention (10 months) as well as at 12 months follow up (22 months). CLASS is a multidimensional observational measure of process quality in daycare, for toddlers. Trained observers observe each group of children and staff for 3 loops of 15 minutes. Quality is assessed along 8 dimensions and 2 quality domains. Scores are given on a scale from 1-7 with 7 indicating higher quality, except on the dimension negative climate, where 1 indicates higher quality. The dimension score of negative climate is reversed when domain scores are calculated. Scores of 1-2 indicates low quality, 3-5 mediocre, and 6-7 high. Scores for each cycles are calculated, and averaged to give the dimension scores. Domain scores are then calculated based on the averaged domain scores.</description>

    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist for preschool children (CBCL)(Achenbach, T. M., 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 months and 22 months (one year follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>100 item parent report of child behavioral, emotional and social problems. each item is rated as 0 (Not True),1 (Somewhat or Sometimes True), or 2 (Very True, or Often True). Low scores indicate fewer problems. The measure is used to measure change in problem behavior during the intervention period (from baseline to end of intervention), and used as an outcome measure at post intervention (10 months) to see whether children in childcare center where the quality has positively changed during the intervention period will have less problem behavior.</description>

    <description>100 item teacher report of child behavioral, emotional and social problems. Each item is rated as 0 (Not True),1 (Somewhat or Sometimes True), or 2 (Very True, or Often True). Low scores indicate fewer problems. The measure is used to measure change in problem behavior during the intervention period (from baseline to end of intervention), and used as an outcome measure at post intervention (10 months) to see whether children in childcare center where the quality has positively changed during the intervention period will have less problem behavior.</description>

    <measure>The Brief Infant-Toddler Social and emotional Assessment (BITSEA) (Briggs-Gowan, M. J., Carter A.S. , Irwin J.R., Wachtel K. &amp; Cicchetti D.V., 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 months and 22 months (one year follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>BITSEA is a 42 item instrument to assess social-emotional/behavioral problems and delays in social-emotional competence in toddlers. The BITSEA is completed both by parents and child care staff. We use BITSEA to measure change in problem behavior during the intervention period (from baseline to end of intervention), and BITSEA is also used as an outcome measure at post intervention (10 months) and at 12 months follow up (22 months) to see whether children in childcare centers where the quality has positively changed during the intervention period will have less problem behavior.</description>
