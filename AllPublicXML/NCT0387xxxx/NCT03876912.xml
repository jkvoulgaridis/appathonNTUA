  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-five men with newly diagnosed, metastatic prostate cancer are scanned with 18F-PSMA
      1007 PET/CT at baseline, 2-3 weeks after the initiation of GnRH-antagonist and at the time of
      castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The aim of the study is to classify metastatic
      lesions into those with PSMA-flare and those without and determine their potential to
      progress during the follow-up until CRPC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In metastatic prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been traditionally used
      as a first line approach. Based on histological studies, animal models and PSMA-PET imaging,
      it is known that administration of ADT increases prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
      expression.

      Preliminary results of our previous prospective clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov
      identifier: NCT03313726) with nine men demonstrated a heterogenous flare in PSMA expression
      2-3 weeks after ADT, more evidently in bone metastases. Our hypothesis is that metastatic
      lesions having PSMA-flare respond differently to ADT and have different outcome than those
      without PSMA-flare. Therefore, the objective of the study is to demonstrate the PSMA-flare
      seen in bone lesions 2-3 weeks after ADT and then determine the potential predictive value of
      the phenomenon in the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

      Thirty-five men with newly diagnosed, metastatic PC will undergo 18F-PSMA 1007 PET/CT before
      and 2-3 weeks after the initiation of sub-cutaneous injection of GnRH-antagonist (Degarelix,
      Firmagon®). A subgroup of ten patients will receive an additional FDG PET/CT scan before ADT
      to investigate whether lesions with PSMA flare show a different metabolic behaviour on FDG
      PET. During the follow-up, 18F-PSMA 1007 PET/CT will be also performed once a year. Finally
      all patients will repeat 18F-PSMA 1007 PET/CT at the time of CRPC. In addition to imaging,
      PSA is measured, and blood drawn for androgen levels and biomarkers in three months interval.
