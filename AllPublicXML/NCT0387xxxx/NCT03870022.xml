      A clinical study enrolling 70 subjects to:

        -  evaluate the user performance of the Pivot Breath Sensor

        -  compare measurements from the Pivot Breath Sensor to a similar device

        -  assess user documentation comprehension

        -  obtain feedback on the Pivot Breath Sensor via rating scales. No medical decisions will
           be made related to test results.

      The objectives of this performance study are to:

        -  Non-invasively measure carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the exhaled breath of study
           subjects using two different types of measurement devices.

        -  We will assess the correlation between the measured CO levels (in parts per million, or
           ppm) of the study CO breath sensor (Carrot Inc.) and a similar device.

        -  assess user documentation comprehension

        -  obtain feedback on the Pivot Breath Sensor via rating scales.

    <measure>User performance of Pivot Breath Sensor.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Assess user performance of the study device at a single visit. Participants will be observed if they can set up the Pivot Breath Sensor, use the device and interpret results. Observer ratings include 'Successful' and 'Unsuccessful'. Specific attention will be given to assess if any harms can occur from observed use errors.</description>

    <description>Compare study device performance with a similar device at a single visit.
Participants will then be asked to use a similar CO breath sensor device. The correlation between the measured CO levels (in parts per million, or ppm) of the study CO breath sensor (Carrot Sense) and the similar breath sensor will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User documentation assessment with observer ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participant understanding of user documentation will be assessed at single visit. User documentation includes packaging information, quick start guide and user manual. Observer ratings include 'Successful' and 'Unsuccessful'.
Participant will be asked to assess the user documentation throughout the study session and will take approximately 10 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant feedback using rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 minutes per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participant will be asked to provide ratings on the following:
How would you rate the ease or difficulty using the device?
How clear or unclear was the Quick Start Guide? Why?
How clear or unclear was the Packaging? Why?
How clear or unclear was the User Manual on the iPad? Why?
Overall, how clear or unclear were the provided reference materials? Why?
How easy or difficult was it to understand and interpret the test results? Why?
The participant will use the following rating scale:
5 - Very Easy 4 - Easy 3 - Neither Easy nor Difficult 2 - Difficult
1 - Very difficult Not Applicable
Participant will provide the ratings prior to the conclusion of the study session. Participant assessment with questionnaire rating scales will take approximately 1-2 minutes each.</description>
