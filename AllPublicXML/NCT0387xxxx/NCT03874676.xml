  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A qualitative design using the thematic analysis method is proposed to answer the research
      question &quot;What is the patient care provider's experience of PEACE rounds?&quot; By establishing
      salient themes pertaining to the experience and identifying the most significant variables,
      the study results will also contribute to more generalizable quantitative studies. This
      information can be used to inform best practice in the standardization and delivery of
      modified PEACE Rounds.

    <textblock>
      Qualitative data about participants' experiences throughout the PEACE Rounds will be
      collected using semi-structured interviews and participant observation. This data will be
      analyzed to describe and explain the perceptions that emerge from participant experience.

      Qualitative Sampling Purposive samples are identified to initiate data collection and
      analysis, and then are used to select participants who are likely to clarify, verify, or
      contradict data as it is collected. Sampling concludes when the data are &quot;saturated,&quot; which
      means the coded categories are well-defined and no new significant insights are emerging from
      additional interviews.

      Semi-structured Interviews

      The study team will conduct semi-structured interviews, which will be recorded and
      transcribed, following a consented subject's participation in at least one PEACE round.
      Open-ended questions, intended to elicit participants' perspectives on their experience of
      PEACE Rounds, will frame the interview. These are:

      &quot;What/who do you remember most vividly?&quot; &quot;What was most meaningful to you? &quot;What would you
      change about the experience, if you could? &quot; &quot;Would you do it again? Why or why not?&quot; &quot;What,
      if anything, changed after PEACE rounds?&quot;

      Observation PEACE Rounds will be observed by the PI to collect data that will provide further
      insight to participants' experiences. Observations of interactions and reactions in real time
      will be documented and the data will be coded and analyzed using thematic analysis methods.
      Observational data will not be integrated into interview data but will be used to confirm or
      contrast reported data.

      Qualitative Data Analysis Qualitative methodology does not seek to verify hypotheses based on
      logical assumptions, as quantitative measures do, instead it is used to derive salient
      constructs directly from the data. This methodology allows inductive understanding of
      participants' perceptions of their participation in PEACE Rounds.

      The qualitative data will be analyzed according to the thematic analysis method based on that
      of Braun and Clarke . the researcher has become familiar with the data and generated an
      initial list of ideas that are relevant to the research objective, codes will be generated.
      The codes will reflect a specific feature of the data that further explicates it. After the
      data has been coded, the researcher will look for how different codes can be combined to
      create overarching themes. When there is essentially no new information coming from the
      codes, the data is considered saturated and no new themes are created. At this point, the
      researcher will review the themes and refine them, so they can be expressed in a data map
      expressing how they fit together to tell the story of the data.

    <description>Analysis of data collected throughout the study, using saturation sampling and documented coding techniques, will result in thematic descriptions of the aggregated experiences of clinical staff who participate in PEACE rounds. Semi-structured interviews will measure the extent to which PEACE Rounds are an effective component on self-help for clinicians and other healthcare workers who care for patients with difficult or controversial treatment plans. Interview questions will include: &quot;What/who do you remember most vividly?&quot; &quot;What was most meaningful to you?&quot; &quot;What would you change about the experience, if you could?&quot; &quot;Would you do it again? Why or why not?&quot; &quot;What, if anything, changed after PEACE rounds?&quot;</description>
