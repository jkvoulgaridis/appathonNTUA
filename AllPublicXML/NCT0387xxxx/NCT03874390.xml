    <description>As described by Silness&amp;Löe 1964; The measurement of the state of oral hygiene by Silness-Löe plaque index is based on recording both soft debris and mineralized deposits on the following teeth. Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3.
Scores 0: No plaque. scores 1: A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may be seen in situ only after application of disclosing solution or by using the probe on the tooth surface.
scores 2: Moderate accumulation of soft deposit s within the gingival pocket, or the tooth and gingival margin which can be seen with the naked eye.
scores 3: Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin.
score 0 considered good oral hygiene, score 3 bad oral hygiene habits. plaque index for a tooth=scores from 4 areas/4 plaque index individiual= scores from 28 tooth/28</description>

    <description>As described by Löe&amp;Silness 1963; The bleeding is assessed by probing gently along the wall of soft tissue of the gingival sulcus. Each of the four surfaces of the teeth (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) is given a score from 0-3.
score 0 — Normal, healthy gingival with sharp, non-inflamed margins. score 1 — Marginal gingivitis with minimal inflammation and edema at the free gingival. No bleeding on probing.
score 2 — Moderate gingivitis with a wider band of inflammation and bleeding upon probing.
score 3 — Advanced gingivitis with inflammation clinically reaching the mucogingival junction usually with ulceration.
score 0 considered healty gingiva, score 3 assesed advanced gingival disease. gingival index for a tooth=scores from 4 areas/4 gingival index individiual= scores from 28 tooth/28</description>

    <description>As described by Ainamo&amp;Bay 1975; The index is performed through gentle probing of the orifice of the gingival crevice. If bleeding occurs within 10 seconds a positive finding is recorded and the number of positive sites is recorded and then expressed as a percentage of the number of sites examined.
bleeding present (+) absent (-) bleeding surface/all surface *100=% bleeding absent recording is equivalent to gingival index scores 0&amp;1. bleeding present recording is equivalent to gingival index score 2&amp;3.
0: no bleeding on probing, healty gingiva
100: all gingiva bleeding on probing; diseased gingiva.</description>
