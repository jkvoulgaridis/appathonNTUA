    <textblock>
      This is to be one-centre, single ascending dose and double-blind multiple ascending dose two
      part study of CPL500036 compound in healthy volunteers.

      PART A is a single dose, open-label part with CPL500036 compound administered with dose
      escalation between cohorts.

      PART B is a multiple, double-blind part with CPL500036 compound administered for 14 days with
      dose escalation between cohorts. Participants in this part are to be randomized to receive
      Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) or placebo in 3:1 ratio.

      Safety and pharmacokinetic properties of CPL500036 compound is to be determined following
      different doses in single oral IMP administration in PART A and different doses of IMP
      administered orally for two weeks in PART B.
