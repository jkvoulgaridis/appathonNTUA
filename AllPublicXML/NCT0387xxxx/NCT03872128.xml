  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To use pregnenolone (PREG; 300; 500mg) daily versus placebo (PLA) as a probe to assess the
      role of neuroactive steroids in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effects of PREG on a) alcohol craving, mood and neuroendocrine
      reactivity to brief, guided imagery exposure to stress, drug cues and neutral situations in
      the laboratory and b) daily alcohol intake, craving, cognition and mood in men and women with
      AUD; and c) sex differences in all of these outcomes.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change compared to baseline in percent heavy drinking days and any drinking days as well as number of drinks per drinking day will be the main outcomes. These will be assessed by self report on the Substance Use Calendar, daily smartphone monitoring and corroborated by weekly urine toxicology and breathalyzer screening.</description>

    <description>Alcohol craving assessed in laboratory experiment with exposure to stress, drug cues and neutral control condition in week 2 of PREG (300mg; 500mg) vs. Placebo treatment. Alcohol craving will be assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) in which 0=&quot;not at all&quot; and 10=&quot;extremely high&quot;.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provoked negative emotion and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>in week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Differential Emotion Scale (DES). Subjects will be asked to rate their current emotional state for the following subscales: anger, fear, sadness, anxiety, joy, neutral-relaxed feelings. Each subscale includes five adjectives (a total of 30 items) and will be used to describe each affect state and subjects are required to rate on a 5-point scale the extent to which each word describes the way s/he feels at the present time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly alcohol craving</measure>
    <time_frame>weekly over the 8 week period</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol craving will be measured using the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), which is a brief 8-item self-report craving scale. Subjects are asked to rate on a Likert Scale ranging from 1-7 how strongly they disagree or agree with a statement regarding the urge for alcohol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Negative mood and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used; it is a 7 item, brief measure of generalized symptoms of anxiety and fear. Respondents indicate how they currently feel and responses are rated on a 4-point Likert scale and range from 0 to 3.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Systematic Assessment of Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) Questionnaire will be used to assess adverse events weekly during the trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol withdrawal severity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol withdrawal signs and symptoms will be measured weekly using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA), which is a 13-item scale assessment. Items on this scale include objective measures (e.g., pulse), participants' responses to questions, such as orientation to time and space (&quot;What day is this? Where are you? Who am I?&quot;), and observations by the interviewer (evidence of tremor or paroxysmal sweats). Item responses range from 0 indicating no evidence of the symptom to 4 indicating highest severity of symptoms and possible total scores could range from 0 to 67.</description>
