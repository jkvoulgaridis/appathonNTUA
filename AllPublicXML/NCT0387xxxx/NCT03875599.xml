      Recent updates on Pulmonary Rehabilitation highlight the importance of patients'
      self-efficacy on long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors. The Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE) is an adaptation of the General
      Self-Efficacy Scale. This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt and evaluate reliability
      and validity of PRAISE on Portuguese respiratory patients.Forward-backward translation and
      pilot testing were performed. Content validity was assessed by a multidisciplinary panel of
      expert judges. To evaluate reliability and validity, 150 respiratory outpatients on Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation participated on a cross-sectional study. Descriptive and reliability analyses,
      and exploratory factorial analysis using principal axis factoring, followed by oblique
      oblimin factor rotation were conducted to identify construct validity. IBM® SPSS® version 22
      was used to perform statistical analysis.

    <description>Vincent and co-authors (2011) proposed the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE). The PRAISE tool is composed by a total of 15 items, combining 10 items from the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) by Schwarzer and Jerusalem (1995), and 5 new specific items related to Pulmonary Rehabilitation. Each item is scored from 1 to 4 with a total range from 15 to 60, with higher scores indicating higher levels of self-efficacy. Araújo and Moura (2011) already validated a Portuguese version of the GSE, yet the assessment of self-efficacy remains to be explored on the Portuguese Pulmonary Rehabilitation setting. This study translated, culturally adapted and evaluated reliability and validity of PRAISE on Portuguese respiratory patients, with original author's permission. Hence, items 4, 7, 9, 12 and 15 were specific to Pulmonary Rehabilitation as proposed by PRAISE original authors, and the remaining items and answer key were in accordance with the portuguese GSE.</description>
