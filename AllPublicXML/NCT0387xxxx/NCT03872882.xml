      An evaluation and comparison of results between the 'Accuscreen New' currently in use and an
      'Accuscreen New' with different settings to see if the new settings reduce unnecessary
      referrals for babies from newborn hearing screening.

      Babies will be tested with the standard and modified equipment. Referrals for diagnostic
      testing will be based on the standard equipment. A comparison in referrals between the
      standard and modified equipment will be made.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All newborn babies undergo hearing screening, usually within the first few days of life and
      some are tested with the automated auditory brainstem response test (AABR). This involves
      recording activity from the hearing nerve and parts of the brainstem from three small sensors
      placed on the baby's head and neck when a series of clicking sounds are played in to the ear.

      In March 2015 we started using an 'Accuscreen New' to record the AABR, which is approved by
      the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP) and used widely across the UK. However, since
      introducing the new equipment the 'screen refer' rate increased significantly in very young
      babies (less than 48 hours old) and diagnostic testing showed they had satisfactory hearing.
      The impact of the increased referral rate caused increased delays on diagnostic testing and
      also lead to unnecessarily increased parental anxiety in relation to the hearing of their new
      born baby.

      The equipment suppliers (GN Otometrics) and the NHSP Programme centre have agreed to an
      evaluation and comparison of results between the 'Accuscreen New' currently in use and an
      'Accuscreen New' with different settings which we believe will reduce unnecessary referrals
      of so many young babies to Audiology (the modified equipment will test for up to 10 minutes
      to see if a response is present, instead of stopping after one or two minutes).

      Babies will be tested with the standard and modified equipment. Referrals for diagnostic
      testing will be based on the standard equipment. A comparison in referrals between the
      standard and modified equipment will be made.
