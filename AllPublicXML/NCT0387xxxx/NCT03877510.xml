  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and clinical utility of IPX203
      in the treatment of subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who have motor
      fluctuations.

      This is a 9-month, multicenter open-label safety extension study. Subjects who have
      successfully completed Study IPX203-B16-02 [A Randomized Controlled Study to Compare the
      Safety and Efficacy of IPX203 with Immediate-Release (IR) Carbidopa-Levodopa (CD-LD) in
      Parkinson's Disease Patients with Motor Fluctuations] may have the opportunity to enroll in
      this open-label study.

    <description>The NMSS is a 9 domain, 30 question scale rating symptom severity on a scale of 0-3 with 3 being most severe; and frequency on a scale of 1-4 with 4 being most frequent. Each question is answered with a severity and frequency rating which are then multiplied. The sum of the products gives the total score. Zero is the best score and 360 is the worst score.</description>
