    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study on safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood therapy for patients
      with Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS). This is an 1 year trial with 3 IV infusions
      (4 months apart from each infusion) of umbilical cord blood units with oral Sirolimus to see
      the safety and efficacy.

      This is a pilot study on safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood therapy for patients
      with Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS is a rare genetic disease where
      affected LMNA gene coding lamin A protein leads to premature aging and early death.

      Teenagers with HGPS are in high risk of atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke, and these are
      major reason of mortality in HGPS.Currently, there are no definite cure for this rare genetic
      disease. Among the potential drugs under investigation, Lornafarnib (farnesyltransferase
      inhibitor) lowered the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and also lowered
      mortality.

      Stem cell therapy has proven its efficacy in progeria mouse model. We are trying to study
      safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood therapy in human HGPS patients.
