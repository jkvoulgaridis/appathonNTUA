  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTERCEDE randomized trial will establish whether six-months of intermittent pneumatic
      compression combined with walking exercise improves walking endurance at six-month follow-up,
      compared to walking exercise + sham compression therapy, in people with lower extremity
      peripheral artery disease (PAD). The INTERCEDE trial will also determine whether intermittent
      pneumatic compression therapy improves walking endurance at 6-month follow-up, compared to a
      sham compression therapy. The trial will also determine whether benefits of intermittent
      pneumatic compression persist after intermittent pneumatic compression treatment is
      completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking exercise is first-line therapy for PAD. However, many PAD patients are unable or
      unwilling to exercise. Therefore, in people with PAD, the investigators will determine
      whether intermittent pneumatic compression augments the benefits of exercise and whether
      intermittent pneumatic compression alone improves walking performance compared to sham
      control. The investigators will conduct a randomized trial (2 x 2 factorial design) of 230
      PAD participants randomized to one of four groups: Group A: intermittent pneumatic
      compression + exercise; Group B: intermittent pneumatic compression+ &quot;no exercise&quot; control;
      Group C: sham control + exercise; and Group D: sham control + &quot;no exercise&quot; control. The
      intermittent pneumatic compression and sham interventions will be delivered for six months.
      The primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at 6-month follow-up. In secondary
      aims, the investigators will determine whether the benefits of intermittent pneumatic
      compression persist even after intermittent pneumatic compression is discontinued and
      delineate mechanisms by which intermittent pneumatic compression affects walking performance,
      by measuring changes in MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion and physical activity. The
      investigators will determine whether intermittent pneumatic compression improves systemic
      endothelial function, by measuring changes in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows: first, an ankle-brachial
        index (ABI) &lt; or = 0.90 at the baseline study visit is an inclusion criterion for PAD.
        Second, potential participants with an ABI &gt;0.90 who have vascular laboratory evidence of
        PAD. Vascular laboratory evidence consists of objective evidence of PAD, including toe
        brachial index (TBI) &lt; 0.70, Duplex measure showing 70% stenosis or greater, or ABI values
        &lt; 0.90. Abnormal waveforms or pulse volume recordings alone from a non-invasive vascular
        laboratory test will not be sufficient for enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Above- or below-knee amputation.

          2. Critical limb ischemia or ABI &lt; 0.30.

          3. Wheelchair-bound.

          4. Current foot ulcer on bottom of foot.

          5. Walking is primarily limited by a symptom other than PAD.

          6. Failure to successfully complete the study run-in.

          7. Major surgery, revascularization, or orthopedic surgery in the past 3 months or
             planned in the next 12 months.

          8. Major medical illness including Parkinson's Disease, renal disease requiring dialysis,
             lung disease requiring oxygen, cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years,
             or life-threatening illness with a life expectancy of less than six months.
             Participants who only use oxygen at night will be potentially eligible. [NOTE:
             potential participants treated for cancer in the past two years may still qualify if
             they have had treatment for early stage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis
             is excellent. Potential participants treated for basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer will not be excluded.]

          9. Already exercising at a level consistent with exercise intervention. Current or recent
             participation in exercise rehabilitation (within the past six months).

         10. Recently diagnosed (within the past three months) with acute lower extremity deep
             venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or severe heart failure (i.e. New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV).

         11. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score &lt;23 or dementia.

         12. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.

         13. Non-English speaking.

         14. Increase in angina in the past month, angina at rest,or abnormal baseline treadmill
             stress test. Potential participants may become eligible following an abnormal baseline
             treadmill stress test if they have evidence of an absence of coronary ischemia based
             on testing with their own physician and if they do not have symptoms of unstable
             angina.

         15. Ongoing infection of the toes, foot, or lower extremity or cellulitis

         16. Potential participants who started on cilostazol within the last three months. They
             may be evaluated for eligibility once three months have passed since beginning
             cilostazol.

         17. Significant peripheral edema, defined as 3+ or greater edema severity, as determined
             by the principal investigator.

         18. BMI &gt;45

         19. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.
