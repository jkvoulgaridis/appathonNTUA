  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib,single arm,open label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      CT053PTSA in patients with advanced and metastatic renal cell cancer who have progressed from
      previous treatment

      This study is being carried out in two parts,part 1 and part 2. Part 1: This is the
      dose-escalation part. The primary purpose of the part 1 portion is to determine the dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommend the appropriate doses
      of CT053PTSA for further study Part 2: This is the expansion part.The part 2 portion of this
      study will continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA at the appropriate dose
      recommended in Part 1,in patients with advanced and metastatic RCC
