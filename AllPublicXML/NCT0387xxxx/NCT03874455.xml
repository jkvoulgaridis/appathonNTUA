      Patients with following conditions are eligible to enroll in the EAP:

        -  Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES)

        -  Spindle cell sarcoma

        -  Sinonasal carcinoma

        -  Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary Hypercalcemic Type (SCCOHT)

        -  Thoracic sarcoma

        -  Poorly differentiated chordoma

      These conditions must be serious or life-threatening at the time of enrollment and
      appropriate, comparable, or satisfactory alternative treatments must have been tried without
      clinical success. Patients with conditions not listed above are not eligible for the
