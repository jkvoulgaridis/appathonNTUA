  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if there is any difference in the amount of weight gained by
      participants taking olanzapine with CORT118335 compared with olanzapine with placebo (a dummy
      test medicine which looks like CORT118335 but contains no active medicine). Safety and
      tolerability of CORT118335 when taken with olanzapine will also be evaluated.
