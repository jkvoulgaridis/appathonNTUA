  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and Becker Dystrophy, hereafter DMD and BMD, is a serious and
      progressive disease that affects 1 in 3,500-6,000 males born alive. Scale 6-minute walking
      test, is used for determine the inclusion of children with DMD in pharmacological studies.
      Furthemore, is used to verify a training effectiveness assessing muscular endurance and
      cardio-respiratory functions. This Research evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of a
      multimodal physiotherapist program with virtual reality glasses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition a physiotherapy program, virtual reality have a lot of importance advantages for
      train while motivated the kids.

      A cross over study will be applied. In the control time, patient will received a initial
      evaluation and a final without making the physiotherapy program and without virtual reality
      glasses. The data will be collected by principal examiner.

      In the intervention time the group will received 10 multimodal physiotherapy sessions, two
      per week, along five weeks. Also they are going to training walking in a treadmill with
      virtual reality glasses.

      Multimodal physiotherapist program describes the exercises to be performed, how long it will
      take, the number of repetitions and the way to do it with the physiotherapist.

      At the end of the multimodal physiotherapy program, variables will be evaluated by the
      principal examiner.

    <measure>Changes in six meter walking test (6-MWT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Six-meter walking test is a a well-established outcome measure in a variety of diseases. It is accurate, reproducible, simple to administer, and well tolerated. The 6MWT is a robust assessment tool for use in clinical trials given its ability to quantitatively evaluate ambulation in a controlled environment.</description>

It shows 11 numerical descriptors (0 to 10), 5 verbal descriptors located every 2 levels of intensity, and a set of illustrations that represent a child running at increasing intensities along a scale of bars of incremental height following a exponential type slope from left to right. The higher value represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>NSAA o North Star Ambulatory Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional scale for children with DMD. It is expressed in points and evidences the acquisition of functions or the loss of them. Whilst DMD children may generally present with recognizable adaptations to activity due to the underlying progressive muscular weakness, they may modify their activity to achieve functional goals in slightly differing ways. Generally, activities are graded in the following manner:
2 - 'Normal' - no obvious modification of activity
1 - Modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another 0 - Unable to achieve independently. The better punctuation is 34 point, what mean the higher outcome.</description>
