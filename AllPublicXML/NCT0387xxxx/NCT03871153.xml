    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-institutional, single arm Phase II trial. All patients will be
      treated with Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Durvalumab and Radiation. All patients with non-PD
      after induction therapy who remain surgical candidates will undergo surgical resection 4-12
      weeks following induction therapy.

      After surgical resection, all patients who remain eligible will be treated with adjuvant
      Durvalumab every 4 weeks for 6 cycles beginning 4-12 weeks after surgical resection.

             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative
             for HCV RNA. Subjects with HIV/AIDS with adequate antiviral therapy to control viral
             load would be allowed. Subjects with viral hepatitis with controlled viral load would
