    <textblock>
      NIH-Healing Experience in All Life Stressors (NIH-HEALS) is a 35 item self-report
      questionnaire developed by the NIH Clinical Center Pain and Palliative care. It assesses an
      individual's mechanisms for coping as a means to reach &quot;healing&quot; during life's difficult
      situations and/or life limiting challenges. The factorial structure of the tool has been
      recently re-examined with 200 patients. The three main factors are: Connection (including
      religious, spiritual, interpersonal), Reflection/ Introspection, and Trust/Acceptance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Clinical Center Pain and Palliative Care Service (PPCS) we have developed a
      pscyho-social-spiritual measure, the Healing Experience in all Life Stressors (HEALS), that
      focuses on the healing experience in people with severe and life limiting illness. We have
      validated this tool further in order to be able to identify those individuals who may benefit
      from additional interventions to cope with their illness and even assist them in reaching a
      healing experience that is possible even in the midst of their unfavorable circumstances.
      Identification of vulnerable individuals as well individuals who do have transformative
      experience after being diagnosed with severe and life limiting illness, has far-reaching
      impact on the quality of patient care for the very sick patients.

    <measure>National Institutes of Health- Healing Experience of All Life Stressors (NIH-HEALS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on our validation study (Ameli et.al., 2018), we now propose a 35-item, three-factor NIH-HEALS as a measure of psycho-social-spiritual healing. These three factors include: Connection, Reflection &amp; Introspection, and Trust &amp; Acceptance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Integration Scale (SIS) -V2</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>SIS is an 18 item self report measure with 2 factors: Healed and Co-dependent. As predicted NIH-HEALS positively correlated with the Healed and negative correlated with the Co-dependent factors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well being (FACIT-SP)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-SP is a 12 item self report that measures spiritual well being and is a part of the larger FACIT measurement system (www.FACIT.org). A 3 factor structure has been reported with cancer patients and include meaning, peace, and faith. As predicted, NIH-HEALS correlated positively with these 3 factors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>MAAS is a self report measure of trait mindfulness with 15 items. As predicted NIH-HEALS correlated positively with MAAS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) (10 item version)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>CD-RSIC is a 10 item self-report measure of resilience. As predicted NIH-HEALS positively correlated with CD-RISC</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Events Checklist 5 (LEC-5) (standard self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>LEC-5 is a 17 item self-report measure designed to screen for potentially traumatic events in a respondent's lifetime. The LEC-5 assesses exposure to 16 events known to potentially result in PTSD or distress and includes one additional item assessing any other extraordinarily stressful event not captured in the first 16 items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic Questionnaire (DQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>DQ collected information on gender, age, ethnicity, race, marital status, religious affiliation, education, employment status, medical diagnosis, length of illness, severity of illness, psychiatric co-morbidity, perceived stress level, perceived level of social support, overall health status, and overall quality of life.</description>
