      This study is designed to investigate whether using osteopathic manipulation can increase the
      milk supply in lactating women.

      The short and long-term benefits of breastfeeding to both the mother and infant are well
      established. Benefits for the child range from protection against common childhood
      infections, decreased rates of type-2 diabetes and systolic hypertension, lower rate of
      sudden infant death syndrome, increased performance on intelligence tests, and possible
      reduction in obesity. Maternal benefits include a reduction in the risk of breast cancer,
      diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, obesity, and ovarian cancer.
      Given this evidence the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Academy of
      Pediatrics recommend, exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first six months. WHO goes
      on to recommend breastfeeding to 2 years and beyond if mutually agreeable to both the mother
      and child. Despite these benefits and recommendations, according to the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States 81% of infants were started breastfeeding
      and only 51% continued at 6 months. Perceived or actual low milk supply is one of the most
      common reasons for discontinuing breastfeeding.

      This protocol is designed to investigate scientifically our current osteopathic standard of
      care. There is no available research data to date specifically on using osteopathic
      manipulation as an intervention to increase milk supply in lactating women.
