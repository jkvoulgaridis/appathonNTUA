  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective cohort study is to explore the clinical significance of sentinel
      lymph node imaging combined imaging examination evaluation in pelvic and peritoneal
      lymphadenectomy for endometrial carcinoma management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical data including surgical procedure, the situation of sentinel lymph node imaging
      and pathological results of patients with endometrial carcinoma treated in our hospitals
      between April 2019 and April 2021 will be analyzed in this study to clarify the homogeneity
      of imaging evaluation, sentinel lymph node development evaluation and pathological results.
