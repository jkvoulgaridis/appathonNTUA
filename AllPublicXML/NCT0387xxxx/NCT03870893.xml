  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research analyzes whether hippotherapy improves the physical activity, cardiopulmonary
      fitness, and attention in children with cerebral palsy and whether this enhances their
      general health and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to promote hippotherapy by scientifically proving its therapeutic effects
      and mechanism to contribute to improving the health and quality of life of the patients as
      well as reducing their global burden of disease by shifting the current passive
      &quot;therapy-oriented&quot; paradigm to a more proactive &quot;participation-oriented&quot; paradigm.

      Ever since physical activity and physical fitness have been reported to have an inverse
      relationship with the mortality rate, especially deaths due to cardiovascular disease,
      various efforts have been made to optimize physical activity and physical fitness among
      children with cerebral palsy. ADHD is one of the most common coexisting conditions of
      cerebral palsy. More participation in engaging sports activities like therapeutic riding is
      anticipated to improve patient health and their quality of life.

      Hippotherapy is expected to improve clinical symptom of ADHD in children with cerebral palsy
      while preventing possible ensuing psychiatric disorders, thereby bringing significant
      improvement in their health and quality of life.

    <description>Child Behavior Checklist; The Social Ability Scale consists of Sociality Scale and Academic Performance Scale. The Scale of Problem Behavior Syndrome consists of 113 items related to problem behavior, and 13 (Sociality, Learning Problem, Total Social Ability, Atrophy, , Depression, social immaturity, thinking problems, attention problems, flying, aggression, internalization problems, externalizing problems, total problem behaviors). For each question, the scale is to be rated as 3-point Likert scale, the raw scores of all subscales are converted to standardized T scores . The higher the score, the higher the tendency toward problem behavior.</description>

    <description>Quantitative electroencephalography; using Neuroscan Synamp2 amplifier(Compumedics USA, El Paso, TX, USA); EEG is measured in the closed eye state and the GO / NOGO task state respectively. For quantitative analysis, EEG without a handwriting is digitized by Fast Fourier Transformation. The square root of the magnitude of the EEG was calculated as the microvolt (uV) value, and the relative power is defined as the electrical force of the specific region divided by the electrical force in the whole region. The relative power of delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves and theta / beta ratio measured at the Cz electrode are used for the analysis</description>
