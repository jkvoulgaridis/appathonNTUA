      Introduction: Vaccination is a powerful weapon in the fight against infectious diseases,
      which has led to dramatic reduction in mortality and complications from some diseases. In
      this respect, vaccination is a real worldwide public health challenge (WHO). Thus, vaccine
      research benefits from an exponential development of knowledge in immunology and
      biotechnology. In particular, the advent of recent tools (&quot;omics&quot;, new cytometric assays) and
      the description of new categories of immune cells (Tfh, BReg...) have revolutionized the
      characterization of immune responses, particularly post-vaccination. To study of the immune
      response following vaccination remains essential in order to define the immunological
      correlates to vaccine protection. This response also varies according to parameters related
      to the vaccine (type, adjuvant, dose, regimen…) and to the vaccinated host (genetics, age,
      morbidity, treatment …). Analyzing with new generation immune assays, new data on
      immunological responses post-vaccination from a clinical cohort is therefore essential to
      better define these correlates.

      Objective: To develop new vaccines (HIV, emerging infectious diseases) the investigators use
      a &quot;System vaccinology&quot; method to decipher the mechanisms of immune responses set up against
      vaccines currently being developed or marketed, specifically in specific populations
      (patients with primary immune deficiency, sickle cell patients, solid organ transplanted
      patients, COPD).

      Method: Description of the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of the immune response
      to vaccines recommended for adults, in particular influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, but
      also other mandatory vaccines (MMR,...) or vaccine for travelers (yellow fever, ...) as part
      of routine care in different population categories (healthy subjects, HIV+ subjects, COPD
      patients, …), using qualitative and quantitative immunological assays: transcriptional
      analysis of the dynamic innate immune response, analysis of the lymphocytes B &amp; T responses
      (phenotype, repertoire analysis, functional analysis including T reg and TFH populations,
      antibody response), genetic analysis in the context of primary immune deficiencies)
      Conclusion: The data generated will allow the best possible analysis of vaccine responses
      according to vaccines and vaccinated populations, providing important information for the
      research developed within the department.
