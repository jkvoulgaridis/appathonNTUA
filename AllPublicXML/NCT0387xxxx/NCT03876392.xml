  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the value and feasibility of magnetic resonance
      imaging in detection of bone marrow metastases
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient was diagnosed as bone metastasis by pathology. CT showed no bone marrow biopsy
      site metastasis (anterior iliac spine or posterior iliac spine). After functional magnetic
      resonance examination, bone marrow biopsy was performed. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging includes conventional SE sequence, T2W SPAIR, e-THRIVE,DWI,IVIM. With bone marrow
      biopsy as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and coincidence rate of functional
      MRI in the diagnosis of bone marrow metastasis were evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with malignant tumors (solid tumors or hematological malignancies) were
             definitely diagnosed by pathology or cytology.

          2. patients with bone metastases confirmed by more than two imaging examinations.

          3. Age 18-75.

          4. ECOG score: 0-2.

          5. The expected survival time is more than 3 months.

          6. Sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Imaging findings suggest that bone metastases are present at the bone marrow puncture
             site.

          2. The patient refused bone marrow puncture.

          3. Puncture site with infection.

          4. Severe coagulation dysfunction.

          5. There are implanted instruments in the body, so magnetic resonance imaging can not be
             performed.
