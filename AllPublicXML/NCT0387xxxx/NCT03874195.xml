  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the usability of PCforMe, a web-based preparation and
      engagement tool about palliative care, during a pre-visit pilot trial in outpatient
      palliative care at the Duke Cancer Institute Palliative Care Clinic.

      The Investigator will 1:1 randomize patients to an Active Control arm or Intervention arm.
      Both arms will receive a tablet computer (iPad or Galaxy Tab based on preference) connected
      to the internet with disposable headphones to use for up to 30 minutes. Subjects in the
      Active Control arm will receive a list of three nationally-recognized websites to receive
      information on palliative care - www.palliativedoctors.org; getpalliativecare.org; and
      Wikipedia &quot;Palliative Care&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care). Intervention Arm
      subjects will receive access to PCforMe.

      PCforMe is an online, web-based, interactive tool to prepare patients for a clinical
      palliative care encounter. PCforMe is accessible through www.pcforme.org. It does not collect
      any patient information, including identifiers (e.g. name, email address, disease, location)
      or health information (e.g. disease, symptom severity or location). The system uses a
      combination of animated videos and user-answered questions to generate a &quot;Palliative Care
      Passport&quot;, which is a summary of information entered into the system. Research staff will
      print out the Passport for patients and hand it to them prior to the appointment.

      Queries for users include standard-of-care questions asked by palliative care clinicians,
      including areas that patients want to more learn about. No diagnoses, medication advice, or
      clinical assessments are made or given.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System usability as measured by the system usability scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To determine usability, the System Usability Scale will be administered to each participate. As described by usability.gov: &quot;The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking. Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average, however the best way to interpret the participant's results involves &quot;normalizing&quot; the scores to produce a percentile ranking.&quot; The original scale is a 10-item, 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Palliative Care knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Regarding the change in knowledge outcome, Two-side P value of &lt;0.05 will infer significance. The Palliative Care Knowledge instrument is a 4-item, multiple choice assessment of palliative care knowledge. Only one answer is correct. A change in knowledge of Palliative Care will be determined based on the answer provided in the follow-up assessment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Efficacy for the Patient-Physician Interaction (PEPPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PEPPI will be determined using 5-point Likert response - 1 being Not at all Confident and 5 being Very Confident</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in single-item Prepared item</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
