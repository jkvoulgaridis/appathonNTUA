    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to facilitate uptake of and adherence to HIV pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Kenya. The investigators
      will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial at 24 health facilities in Kisumu, Kenya
      of a clinical training intervention using standardized patient actors. The hypothesis is that
      the training will improve quality of PrEP service delivery, defined as adherence to national
      guidelines and non-judgmental communication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite global gains in female-controlled HIV prevention strategies, the incidence of HIV in
      adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) continues to rise. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
      has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in trial settings, however real-world
      effectiveness at scale is limited by poor adherence.

      An important barrier to uptake and adherence to HIV prevention services among AGYW is the
      experience of judgmental, and non-empathetic interactions with health care workers (HCWs).
      New strategies are needed to improve provider counseling and communication skills to support
      PrEP adherence among AGYW. Standardized patient actors (SPs) have been used in a variety of
      settings to improve clinical assessment and care skills, as well as patient outcomes.

      The &quot;PrIYA-SP&quot; study aims to improve HCW communication skills and adherence to PrEP
      guidelines through a cluster randomized trial of a SP actor training intervention.
      Twenty-four facilities that currently offer PrEP to AGYW in Kisumu County, Kenya will be
      selected. The first phase will include a cross-sectional assessment by unannounced SPs who
      will present to clinics portraying AGYW seeking PrEP, according to case scripts. Following
      the baseline assessment, 12 facilities will be randomized to the SP training intervention.
      The two-day intervention consists of didactic sessions covering national guidelines and
      communication skills, values clarification exercises, role playing sessions with SPs, and a
      group debriefing with HCW participants. Following the intervention, unannounced SPs will
      repeat the cross-sectional assessment.

      The primary outcome is quality of counseling, defined as adherence to national guidelines for
      PrEP delivery and use of non-judgmental communication skills. An intention-to-treat (ITT)
      analysis will be used to evaluate whether the SP training intervention resulted in higher
      quality counseling at intervention compared to control facilities, adjusted for relevant
      baseline characteristics and quality measures. The investigators hypothesize that this SP
      training intervention will improve quality delivery of PrEP to AGYW compared to standard of
      care.

      Results from this study will directly inform operational guidelines for PrEP delivery to AGYW
      in low-resource settings and offer a potentially scalable strategy to improve PrEP service
      delivery and adherence among AGYW.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of PrEP counseling provided by health care workers delivering PrEP to adolescent girls and young women for HIV prevention in Kenya</measure>
    <time_frame>Unannounced standardized patient actor visits take approximately 15 minutes each, taking place over 3-4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality is assessed as total score from a checklist provided by the SPs after each unannounced visit including domains of communication skills and adherence to national guidelines. Communication quality is assessed in an adapted version of the Bayer-Fetzer Kalamazoo Consensus Statement; scores range from 7-28 with higher scores indicating higher quality communication. Guideline adherence is assessed in a scoring system adapted from the Kenyan National AIDS &amp; STI Control Programme guidelines; scores range from 0-13 with higher scores indicating higher PrEP competency. The total quality score will be a combined continuous score per unannounced SP visit. Mean scores among all SP encounters taking place in facilities randomized to the clinical intervention will be compared to mean scores among those randomized to standard of care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Competency score measuring quality of PrEP counseling provided by health care workers during clinical training intervention [among intervention arm only]</measure>
    <time_frame>Standardized patient actor training interactions take approximately 15 minutes each and will occur during a two-day training intervention. Trainings will be conducted over a period of 2-3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome is PrEP competency among HCWs in interactions with SPs during the clinical training intervention, assessed as sub-scores for interpersonal skills, communication quality, and guideline adherence. Interpersonal skills are assessed using the Interpersonal skills (IPS) assessment tool (Van Zanten 2007); scores range from 1-16 with higher scores indicating better interpersonal skills. Communication quality is assessed in an adapted version of the Bayer-Fetzer Kalamazoo Consensus Statement; scores range from 7-28 with higher scores indicating higher quality communication. Guideline adherence is assessed in a scoring system adapted from the Kenyan National AIDS &amp; STI Control Programme guidelines; scores range from 0-13 with higher scores indicating higher competency. The total competency score will be a combined continuous score per SP interaction during the clinical training intervention.</description>
