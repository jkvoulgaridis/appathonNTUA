    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between cortical hyperexcitability,
      abnormalities of brain network function, and cognitive dysfunction in human patients with AD
      and whether administration of the antiepileptic medication levetiracetam (LEV) normalizes
      these measures and improves cognition.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants with early Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) will be tested in a double-blind crossover design with placebo, low-dose
      levetiracetam (LEV) 125 mg twice daily or high-dose LEV 500mg twice daily. These results will
      be contrasted with results from a demographically similar control group who will undergo
      baseline testing only, without any intervention, to establish a comparison norm for the AD
      group.

      Each subject will undergo four screening and baseline visits consisting of a baseline
      neurological, medical, and cognitive evaluation. If amyloid status is unknown in AD patients,
      the participant will have an amyloid PET scan. Additional baseline measures include: a high
      density electroencephalogram (EEG); a 24 hour ambulatory EEG; functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI); neuropsychological testing; and transcranial magnetic stimulation with
      electromyogram (EMG) and EEG measures to assess cortical excitability. AD participants will
      be randomized to one of six possible groups that consists of a varying order of 3 treatment
      periods (LEV 125 mg, LEV 500 mg and placebo). The group assignments will be counterbalanced
      across subjects. Each treatment period will last for 4 weeks with a 4 week washout between
      treatments. All participants will be assessed prior to initiation of a treatment period (with
      the initial assessment occurring as part of the baseline assessment) and at the end of each
      treatment period. The following measures will be repeated as done at baseline at these time
      points: fMRI; neuropsychological testing; and TMS-EMG-EEG. AD participants will be enrolled
      for approximately 5 months.

          -  Diagnosis of epilepsy, or immediate (1st degree relative) family history epilepsy with
             the exception of a single seizure of benign etiology (e.g. febrile seizures) in the
             judgment of a board-certified neurologist. Evidence of epileptiform discharges and
             electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities will be included;

          -  Current or past history of any neurological disorder other than dementia, such as
             epilepsy, stroke (cortical stroke), progressive neurologic disease (e.g. multiple
             sclerosis) or intracranial brain lesions; and history of previous neurosurgery or head
             trauma that resulted in residual neurologic impairment. Non-cortical disease such as
             scattered white matter changes (including lacunar infarcts &lt; 1 cm) and asymptomatic,
             subacute, cerebellar infarcts may be included upon review of a medically responsible
             neurologist. However, subjects with significant vascular disease, as defined by a

             filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30

          -  Medications will be reviewed by the responsible covering physician and a decision
             about inclusion will be made based on the participant's past medical history, drug
             dose, history of recent medication changes or duration of treatment, and combination
             with other central nervous system active drugs. Current use of an antiepileptic drug
             will be an absolute exclusion.

             (cortical stroke), progressive neurologic disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis) or
             intracranial brain lesions; and history of previous neurosurgery or head trauma that
             resulted in residual neurologic impairment.

          -  Any current diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar
             disorder, major depressive disorder).

          -  Abnormal Neurologic or Cognitive exam

          -  Use of medications that could alter cortical excitability, as determined by the

             migraine prevention.

          -  History of fainting spells of unknown or undetermined etiology that might constitute
             seizures.

          -  Chronic (particularly) uncontrolled medical conditions that may cause a medical

             asthma, etc.).

          -  Any metal in the brain or skull (excluding dental fillings) or elsewhere in the body
             unless cleared by the responsible covering MD (e.g. MRI compatible joint replacement).
