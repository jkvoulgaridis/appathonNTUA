      Postural control is the ability to control the body position in space for the purpose of
      postural stability.

      Full-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) comprises 36 items and evaluate all components
      of postural control. Full-BESTest classifies postural control across six domains as:
      Biomechanical constraints, Stability Limits/Verticality, Transitions - Anticipatory Postural
      Adjustment, Reactive Postural Response, Sensory Orientation and Stability in Gait. Items in
      each domain are scored from 0 (worst performance) to 3 (best performance), all requires 30
      minutes (maximum score is 108).

      Because of the clinical time limits, MiniBESTest is a shortened version of BESTest was
      developed with 14 tasks. MiniBESTest still addresses almost all components of postural
      control and can be performed 15 min. MiniBESTest is one of the most common methods practiced
      for adult patients. Recently BESTest and miniBESTest had modified by Dewar et al for 8-14
      aged children which termed Kids-BESTest and Kids-Mini-BESTest.

      The aim of this study is to present the Turkish version of Kids-BESTest and Kids-Mini-BESTest
      and practice of validity and reliability on school-aged children will be performed by
      utilizing the Turkish version of Kids-BESTest and Kids-Mini-BESTest in this study.

    <description>It has 14 items and four domains as Anticipatory Postural Adjustments, Reactive Postural Response, Sensory Orientation and Stability in Gait, to focus on the construct of 'dynamic balance'. Mini-BESTest is scored from 0 (worst performance) to 2 (best performance) with a maximum of 28 points.</description>
