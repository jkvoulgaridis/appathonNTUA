  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to demonstrate improvement of daily life functioning and improvement of
      cognitive tests in post traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients suffering from working memory
      deficit, by a 3-month specific cognitive rehabilitation program, in comparison with patients
      with usual non-specific rehabilitation of same duration.

      As secondary objectives, the study aims to:

        -  demonstrate improvement of specific neuropsychological tests of working memory;

        -  demonstrate improvement of non-specific tasks involving working memory;

        -  assess the evolution in not-targeted domains by the specific rehabilitation, which would
           give evidence of a global cognitive stimulation effect;

        -  demonstrate improvement of social integration ability and quality of life;

        -  demonstrate persistence of effects at 3 months and 6 months after the end of treatment;

        -  demonstrate the acceptability, the tolerance and the feasibility of rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Working memory is an essential cognitive function which allows to store briefly and treat
      simultaneous informations, but is often altered after a moderate to severe TBI. This
      alteration results in disabilities and social integration difficulties in the post TBI
      patients. The study team had developped a standardized and hierarchized rehabilitation
      program of working memory. Several experiments have shown the efficacy of the program which
      is now used in routine care by speech-language pathologists and neuropsychologists. However
      it is necessary to provide a robust demonstration of its efficacy in improving function in
      daily life.

      This randomized multicenter study will be performed in 6 centers in the area of
      Île-de-France. 54 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either specific rehabilitation
      of working memory or non-specific rehabilitation. A 10-month follow-up is planned for
      patients of the two arms.

Proportions will be calculated of patients simultaneously improving on the Working Memory Questionnaire (WMQ) and the Brown-Peterson Task:
increase of at least 12 points on WMQ scale,
at least 13% score improvement on the verbal or visuo-spatial Brown-Peterson Task.</description>

    <description>The Working Memory Questionnaire (WMQ), an auto-questionnaire elaborated by the study team, will be used.
The WMQ is a self-administered scale, addressing three dimensions of working memory: short-term storage, attention, and executive control.
It is a self-assessment questionnaire comprising 30 questions scored on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;no problem at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very severe problem in everyday life&quot;). The total score will be used.</description>
