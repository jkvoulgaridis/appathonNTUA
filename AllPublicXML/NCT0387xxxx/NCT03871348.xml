    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Dose Escalation: To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose
           (MAD) and overall safety and tolerability profile of SAR441000 when administered
           intratumorally as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab in patients who have no
           alternative standard treatment options.

        -  Dose expansion (Monotherapy): To determine the objective response rate of SAR441000
           administered intratumorally as monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma whose
           disease has progressed after prior therapy based on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1.

        -  Dose Expansion (Combination): To determine the objective response rate of SAR441000
           administered intratumorally in combination with cemiplimab in patients with melanoma,
           cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR441000 administered as
           monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab.

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of SAR441000.

        -  To characterize the safety of SAR441000 when administered intratumorally as monotherapy
           and in combination with cemiplimab.

        -  To determine the disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR) and progression
           free survival (PFS) of SAR441000.

        -  To determine the recommended dose of SAR441000 for the expansion phase.

      The expected duration of treatment for patients who benefit from study intervention may vary,
      based on progression date. Median expected duration of study per patient is estimated as 9
      months in monotherapy and 12 months in combination therapy.

      The maximum treatment duration for non-progressive patients is up to 52 weeks.
