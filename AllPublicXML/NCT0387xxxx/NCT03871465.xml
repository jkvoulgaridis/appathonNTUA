  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate whether combination of ultrasound-guided
      subdeltoidcorticosteroid injection and physiotherapy is more effective than either treatment
      alone in treatment of patients with chronic subacromial (or subdeltoid) bursitis (SAB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subacromial bursitis (SAB) is a common shoulder disorder characterized by chronic
      shoulder pain with a painful arc of motion, and/or pain on active or passive motions. The
      diagnosis of SAB requires confirmation by an infiltration with local anesthetic. Previous
      study showed that corticosteroid injection is more effective than hyaluronic acid in
      treatment of chronic SAB, however, some (about 20%) patients were not responsive to
      corticosteroid injection, and some responsive patients may have recurrence of symptoms. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether combination of corticosteroids SASD
      injections and physiotherapy is more effective than either treatment alone in chronic SAB.

    <measure>The pain VAS score</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 8 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS score is obtained using a 100-mm-long horizontal line, with 0 mm on the left indicating no pain and 100 mm on the right indicating very severe pain.</description>

    <measure>The scores of the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 8 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The total SPADI score, which ranges between 0 and 100, is calculated by averaging the scores from the pain and disabilities subclasses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The active ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 8 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal active ROMs of the affected shoulder will be measured using a goniometer under the guidelines of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. These measurements included abduction in the frontal plane, forward flexion, internal rotation, and external rotation with the arm at 0 degrees of abduction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 8 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The SDQ is a symptoms-related questionnaire containing 16 items describing common situations that may induce symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. By responding 'yes', 'no', or 'not applicable', the final score is obtained by dividing the number of positively scored items by the total number of applicable items and then multiplying this number by 100, which results in a final score ranging between 0 (no disability) and 100 (the worst situation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC).</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and at 8 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>It is composed of 5 subscales: physical symptoms, sports/recreation, work, lifestyle, and emotions. Each item has a score range of 0 to 100.Scores can be computed for individual subscales and summated for a total score, which can range from 0-2100, with a higher score representing lower quality of life.</description>
