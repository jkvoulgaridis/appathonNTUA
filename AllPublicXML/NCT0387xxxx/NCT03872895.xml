  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adjustment of adopted adolescents has been studied in the U.S. and England, but few other
      European countries have conducted research into this topic. As countries differ greatly in
      their cultural practices, a comparative study of the adjustment of internationally adopted
      teenagers in 4 European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Norway) is planned. The adjustment
      of teens and their families will be studied in relation to the openness of communication
      related to adoption within the families.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the status of internationally adopted adolescents in
      relation to the characteristics of their families, and to explore the similarities and
      differences in 4 different European countries. Parents and adolescents will complete
      questionnaires which incorporate and adapt many standard measures. The parent questionnaire
      includes components of : a) Family Adjustment and Cohesion Scale (FACES), b) Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire for parents (SDQ-parent), c) Parent Stress Index (PSI), d)
      Adoption Satisfaction Questionnaire (ASQ), d) Brodzinsky Scale (openness in family
      communication related to adoption), and e) basic demographic information.

      The adolescent questionnaire includes elements of : a) SDQ-adolescent, b) Health Behavior in
      School Children questionnaire (HBSC), c) Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), d) Lee Scale
      (Discrimination Scale for Adoptees).

      It is hoped that the study will permit a better understanding of the experiences of families
      and their children after international adoption. This knowledge will help potential adoptive
      families as well as families who have already adopted. This information is not yet available
      in a European context. In addition, the information will be valuable to adoption
      professionals. Moreover, the opportunity to compare outcomes and experiences of families and
      adolescents in 4 European countries will allow a better understanding of the contribution of
      different cultural contexts to these outcomes. It is hypothesized that different cultural
      practices and beliefs about adoption likely impact the experience of adoption by adolescents
      and parents. A better understanding of this dynamic will be useful clinically as well as at
      the community level and beyond.

    <measure>Openness of family communication related to adoption (standardized scale developed by David Brodzinsky)</measure>

    <description>Openness to family communication about the subject of adoption will be assessed using the Brodzinsky standardized scale. This will be correlated to adolescent outcomes (adjustment to family, school, and community) using constructed variables drawn from the Health Behavior in School Children questionnaire</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Stress (using PSI, Parent Stress Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>past year</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Stress will be measured using the widely-used Parent Stress Index. This scale contains 36 items which are completed by parent self-report. The items are combined to form a Total Stress scale. Scoring results in a percentile profile. The normal range=15th-80th percentile. Scores at or above the 85th percentile are considered high (more stress) and Defensive Reponding scores at 10 or below are considered extremely low. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency: minimum =0.8, max=.91, and average=.85. This scale (first published in 1990 by Abdin) has been used and cited in over 4900 scientific papers.</description>
