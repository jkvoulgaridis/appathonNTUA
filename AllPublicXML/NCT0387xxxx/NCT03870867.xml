  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate clinical predictors of intracranial bleeding in elderly
      patients who present to the emergency department (ED) after a fall. The aim is to assess
      feasibility and rate of patient recruitment, patient follow up, and to establish a point
      estimate for the incidence of intracranial bleeding in the investigator's population.

      Currently there are no guidelines for ED physicians to assess the pretest probability of
      intracranial bleed in these patients, and no safe way to exclude a bleed without CT.

    <textblock>
      Seniors account for 15% of the Canadian population. The proportion will greatly increase over
      the next few years. Elderly people attend the ED more often than younger people, and they
      often come to the ED after a fall at home or outside. Falling is associated with head
      injuries, which cause half of all the deaths from falling.

      Head injuries are diagnosed with CT scans. In the ED, it can be difficult for the physician
      to know when to perform a CT scan of the head. It can be hard to know if the elderly person
      hit their head, and often times, people with bleeding in the head can have a normal
      examination. The Investigators think that the overall risk of bleeding in the head in elderly
      who fall is between 3 and 10%. If emergency physicians scanned every senior who fell, only a
      few would show bleeding, the scanning department would be overwhelmed, there would be
      increased costs for the hospital and longer delays for patients. It is important for
      physicians to diagnose a serious head injury as there are lifesaving treatments that can be
      given.

      The Investigators plan to develop a decision rule for emergency physicians that would inform
      them which patients should have a CT scan of the head and which patients can have a serious
      head injury safely ruled out without a CT.

      The Investigators propose to identify and recruit patients over the age of 65 who come to the
      Hamilton General or Juravinski Emergency departments after falling. Patients and their
      caregivers will be consented for a telephone follow-up call after 6 weeks. Data collected
      will include patient characteristics, general health, and blood test results which might be
      predictors of a serious head injury.

      The Investigators will develop a tool to help emergency physicians to order a CT scan on the
      right patients.
