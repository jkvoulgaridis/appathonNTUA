  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to investigate the extent to which ear acupuncture has an
      effect on insomnia in women with breast cancer. It will be investigated whether changes in
      sleep quality, fatigue, quality of life, stress, and psychological well-being can be
      achieved. In addition, a proinflammatory cytokine will be meassured.

    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI contains 19 self-assessment questions and 5 questions rated by the bed-partner or roommate. The 5 questions rated by the bed-partner or roommate are only used as clinical information and not included in qualitative analysis. The question whether a bed-partner or roommate is present is not included in qualitative analysis as well. The 18 self-assessment items are used to evaluate the sleep quality on 7 domains over the last month (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction). Scoring of the answers is based on a scale from 0 to 3, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on a Likert Scale. The total score is generated by the summation of the component scores and can vary from 0 to 21, with a higher score corresponding to a reduced sleep quality. A cut-off score of 5 indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>
