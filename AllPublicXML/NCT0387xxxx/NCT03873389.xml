  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, the investigators aim to recruit 50 patients over an 10-12 month
      period. The investigators will recruit patients with relapsing-remitting MS (based on 2017
      McDonald Criteria) beginning treatment with ocrelizumab and fulfilling study inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Participants recruited in this study will be participants in the Johns
      Hopkins MS Precision Medicine Center of Excellence bio-banking protocol which requires
      collection of serum and plasma at 6-monthly intervals and hence will have blood collection
      performed prior to Ocrevus start and then at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following ocrelizumab
      initiation as part of the bio-banking protocol. All recruited participants will provide
      written informed consent.

      The investigators will collect demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline and
      update these at follow-up visits. These will include disease duration, co-morbidities,
      relapses, treatment status and history. The investigators will also collect physiological
      variables - height and weight at each visit.

      All recruited patients will return for follow up visits at 6,12, 18 and 24 months
      post-ocrelizumab initiation. At each visit patients will undergo the following evaluations -
      EDSS, MSFC, SDMT, fatigue scale (MFIS), quality of life measure (MS-QOL), depression scale
      (Beck depression inventory, 2nd version) and Block Food Frequency Questionnaire.

      The investigators will then utilize plasma collected at the various time points to perform
      global metabolomics analysis. This will yield measures of various metabolites in the
      circulation, including amino acids and metabolites of the amino acids. The investigators will
      utilize this data to determine the change in the circulating metabolome produced by treatment
      with ocrelizumab.

      Following this the investigators will assess changes in the various clinical measures
      collected - disability (EDSS, MSFC), cognition (SDMT), mood (BDI-II), fatigue (MFIS) and
      quality of life (MS-QOL) with Ocrelizumab treatment and correlate these with the changes
      noted in the metabolome. This approach will allow us to determine whether the metabolic
      changes are associated with/ could underlie the changes noted in clinical measures.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the multiple sclerosis functional composite which consists of three assessments of walking speed, processing speed and finger dexterity. The scores are combined to provide a Z-score (number of standard deviations away from mean of a normal population) with lower scores representing greater abnormality.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the modified fatigue impact scale which has 21 questions regarding the impact of fatigue on daily activities and scores range from 0-84. Higher scores reflect greater impact of fatigue on functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical and mental health scores as assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) instrument. This 54-item instrument generates 12 subscales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. Higher scores suggest a better quality of life.</description>
