    <textblock>
      this pilot study aims to further explore the potential usage of Fecal microbiota
      transplantation in treating constipation and possibly also motor symptoms in Parkinson's
      disease (PD) patients, and to increase understanding of the potential relationship between
      the identities of intestinal microbial communities and PD.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a technique in which intestinal microbiota are
      transferred from a healthy donor to the patient, with as primary goal to introduce - or
      restore - a stable and 'healthy' microbial community in the gut.

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms and
      Gastrointestinal dysfunction, in particular constipation, affects up to 80% of PD patients
      and may precede the onset of motor symptoms by years.

      this study include one group of PD patients that will receive FMT. two other groups will
      serve as controls:

        1. PD patients that will not receive FMT

        2. healthy people who live with PD patients in the same house and share similar surrounding
