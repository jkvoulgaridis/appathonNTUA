      The study tested the usefulness of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in selection of
      potential responders to CRT.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an acknowledged therapy of selected patients with
      heart failure (HF). One of the unresolved problems is high percentage of non-responders to
      CRT, reaching 40%. No single parameter, helpful in identifying non-responders prior to CRT
      implantation, was found.

      The study included patients with HF of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, in NYHA class
      II-IV, EF≤35% and QRS≥120ms. All the patients had CRT implanted. Clinical evaluation, CPET
      and NT-proBNP levels measurement were performed before CRT implantation and after 3-6 months.
      Improvement in HF symptoms of one or more NYHA class correlated with two-years survival. It
      was used as the criterion of positive response to CRT.

        The study comprised 122 patients qualified for CRT-D and followed-up for five years after
        CRT implantation. Patients were qualified for CRT-D based on the guidelines of the European
        Society of Cardiology in 2007 and its update in 2010.
