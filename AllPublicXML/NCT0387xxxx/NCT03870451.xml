  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well cryocompression therapy works in reducing bortezomib-induced
      peripheral neuropathy in patients with multiple myeloma. Peripheral neuropathy (nerve pain or
      tingling in hands or feet) is a common side effect of chemotherapy such as bortezomib that
      affects the quality of life and amount of chemotherapy that can be given to many cancer
      patients. Cryocompression is a treatment where a glove and a boot are worn to cool down the
      skin. This cooling treatment is safe and does not interfere with chemotherapy treatment.
      Daily cryocompression therapy may reduce neuropathy caused by bortezomib chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of daily cryocompression therapy in multiple myeloma patients
      with bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the change in patient-reported assessment of neuropathy based on the sensory,
      motor and autonomic neuropathy scores on the European Organization for Research and Treatment
      of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Cancer-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
      (CIPN20) (patient-reported outcome [PRO]) from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after the start of
      cryocompression therapy.

      II. To examine the change in physician graded assessment of peripheral neuropathy by National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0
      criteria from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks after the start of cryocompression therapy.

      III. To assess the effect on sensory and motor nerve function via nerve conduction study
      (NCS) (e.g. conduction velocity, latency, and amplitude) and neuro-ultrasound after 8 weeks
      of daily cryocompression therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effect of 8 weeks of cryocompression on changes in digital artery perfusion
      as measured by ultrasound (US).

      II. To examine the associations among the peripheral nerve assessment measures (nerve
      conduction and peripheral nerve US) with the patient reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20,
      PRO-CTCAE) at baseline, week 4, week 8, and for the change from baseline to week 8.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo home cryocompression therapy treatments on their non-dominant hand and foot
      over 30 minutes daily for 8 weeks.

      After completion of cryocompression therapy, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be feasibility of daily 30-minute cryocompression treatments with a target of 60% compliance. Compliance will be measured by vascular compression unit recorded data. Patient study treatment diary will also be compared and when discrepancies exist, resolved either by asking the patient or discussing with the Study PI. Compliance is defined as completion of 60% of prescribed treatment days. Completion of at least 25 of 30 minutes on each day will be considered completion of therapy on the prescribed day.</description>
