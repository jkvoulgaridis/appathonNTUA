  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is currently not allowed for patients with prolonged aplasia, following intensive
      chemotherapy, to brush teeth due to the risk of damaging the oral mucosa with risk of
      haemorrhage and infectious entrance door. Mouthwash is currently prescribed to prevent these
      complications. Many patients, however, ask to brush their teeth for greater comfort and a
      feeling of well-being.

      Some haematology services allow tooth brushing while others prohibit tooth brushing without
      study.

      Investigators wanted to conduct a study to assess the feasibility, the safety of tooth
      brushing for aplastic patient comfort, hemopathy and/or chemotherapies causing mucous
      membrane alteration that increases infectious risk and the risk of gingivorragia.
