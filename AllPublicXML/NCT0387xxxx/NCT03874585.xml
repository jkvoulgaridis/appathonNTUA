  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unaccompanied homeless youth smoke at much higher rates than non-homeless adolescents and
      young adults. Many homeless youth smokers are motivated to quit; yet, strategies specifically
      developed for this vulnerable population are lacking. This study will develop and pilot test
      a text messaging intervention (also known as a TMI) to help homeless youth quit smoking. Text
      messaging can provide ongoing support for homeless youth during a quit attempt, which is
      important given that these youth tend to be highly mobile and lack regular access to health
      services. Participants in this study will be homeless youth who currently smoke and are
      motivated to quit smoking. All participants will receive a 30-minute group-based smoking
      cessation counseling session and a nicotine replacement product. Half of these smokers will
      also receive the TMI, for 6 weeks following the group counseling session, which will provide
      ongoing support for quitting. The main goal of this study is to investigate whether receiving
      the TMI results in greater reductions in cigarette smoking over a 3-month period compared to
      receiving the group counseling session alone.
