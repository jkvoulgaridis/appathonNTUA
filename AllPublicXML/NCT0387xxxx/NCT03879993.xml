      The aim of this study was verify effects of resistance training in cognitive function, body
      composition and biochemical parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress in people living
      with HIV/AIDS. The sample was composed by patients with HIV/AIDS of both sexes. The patients
      were randomized in two groups, a exercise group (EG), which was receive intervention with
      eight weeks of resistance training, and a control group (CG), that was not to do exercise.
      The cognitive function was analyzed with Stroop Test and Trail Test; body composition was
      evaluated by bioimpedance; blood tests was use to analyze biochemical parameters of
      inflammation and oxidative stress. For statistical analysis was used ANOVA of two factors for
      repeated measurements, having the (EG and PG) group and the time (pre and post exercise).
      Level of significance adopted was P &lt; 0,05.

    <description>Exercise group was resistance training three times per week, during 45 to 60 minutes per day. Training program was composed by bench press, leg press 45°, lat pulldown, knee extension, dumbbell lateral raise, horizontal leg curl, triceps pulldown, seated calf raise, biceps curls and abdominal. Participants should complete 3 series with 8-12 repetitions of each exercise, which was supervised by trained research personnel. There were 60 seconds of interval between series and exercises were separated by a 120 seconds recovery period.</description>
