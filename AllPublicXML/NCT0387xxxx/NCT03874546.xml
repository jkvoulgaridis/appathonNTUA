      Main objective : To compare the quality of the prognostic assessment, (adverse evolution at 6
      months) of severe and moderate traumatic brain injury, performed by the clinician compared to
      the prognosis described by the IMPACT score.

      The Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital is conducting a study evaluating the clinician's prognostic
      assessment of severe and moderate traumatic brain injury compared to the prognosis described
      by the IMPACT score. The investigators compare the quality of the clinician's prognostic
      assessment (adverse evolution at 6 months) of severe and moderate traumatic brain injury to
      the prognosis described by the IMPACT score.

      Design: Prospective, monocentric, pilot study. The study will be proposed to all patients
      admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) at Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital,
      following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), over a period of 1 year. Around 100 patients will
      be included.

      Day 1 : In the first 24 hours after traumatic brain injury, two clinicians will respond to
      the research questionnaire assessing their patient's prognosis, including confidence in their
      prediction and experience in neurological intensive care unit. The known prognostic variables
      as the IMPACT score in the first 24 hours will be collected.

      Day 7 : The same clinicians will respond to the research questionnaire assessing their
      patient's prognosis, including confidence in their prediction and experience in neurological
      intensive care unit.

      At 6 months : After 6 months, all patients or relatives will undergo a telephone interview
      (or if applicable during a follow-up visit in standard care) to assess the Glasgow Outcome
      Scale (GOS). This interview will be blinded to the clinician's prediction and the IMPACT
      score. For patients identified as GOS 3 or 4, a second GOS telephone interview will be carry
      out in the following days (&lt;7 days), by a committee of adjudication composed of 2 examiners.

    <description>Two clinicians will complete a questionnaire that analyses their perception of the patient's prognosis at Day1 and Day7.
At 6 months, another clinician will establish the patient prognosis using Glasgow Outcome Scale and Glasgow outcome scale extended. This clinician must not know the patient's IMPACT score and prognosis established at Day 1 and Day 7. His evaluation will be compare to the patient's prognosis established previously (Day1 and Day7).</description>
