  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute traumatic subdural hematomas (TSDH) readmission rate is high (27.8%) with an increase
      in morbidity and cost for the elderly. This study identifies risk factors affecting
      readmission rates for these patients and presents strategies to reduce it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with traumatic brain injuries (ICD-9-CM
      codes 800.20 - 801.86, 852.00 - 853.05) admitted between 2014 and 2016 at Genesys Regional
      Medical Center through the trauma service. From this group, the investigators selected
      patients admitted with traumatic SDH, and those patients were followed over the following 6
      months as regards to readmission status. Patients who were readmitted versus patients who
      were not readmitted were compared. The risk of readmission within 6 months of discharge for
      SDH was analyzed adjusting for age, prior anticoagulation use, Injury Severity Score (ISS),
      Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), gender, time to readmission and co-morbid conditions which included
      diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, and osteoporotic/orthopedic fractures using Cox Proportional Hazards Regression
      analysis.
