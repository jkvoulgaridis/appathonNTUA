        Forty adult subjects with moderate to highly exuding wounds that require a dressing will be
        recruited. Only subjects with acute wounds or chronic wounds which are present &gt; 6 weeks
        will be enrolled. Chronic wounds will include pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, diabetic foot
        ulcers. Acute wounds will include dehisced surgical or traumatic wounds. In order to ensure
        a balanced distribution on chronic and acute indications, at least 10 subjects with chronic
        wounds and at least 10 subjects with acute wounds will be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written informed consent.

          2. 18 years of age or older.

          3. Willing and able to make all required study visits.

          4. Able to follow instructions and deemed capable of completing the CWIS questionnaire,
             Patient Assessment Scale and Pain Scale.

          5. Presence of a moderately to highly exuding wound of at least 3cm2 in size.

          6. Presence of a chronic wound of at least 6 weeks duration at the point of enrollment;
             full-thickness, partial thickness or shallow granulating wounds.

             Chronic wounds include:

               -  pressure ulcers or

               -  leg ulcers or

               -  diabetic foot ulcers

             or

             Presence of an acute wound at the point of enrollment; full thickness, partial
             thickness or shallow granulating wounds

             Acute wounds include:

               -  dehisced surgical or

               -  traumatic wounds

          7. The patient has a wound size which can be treated with the available sizes and shapes
             of ALLEVYN Gentle Border. Cutting of the dressing is allowed, if needed. ALLEVYN
             Gentle Border can be cut and an aseptic technique should be used with cutting the
             dressing. Ensure any exposed foam areas are covered with an appropriate film dressing
             taking care not to cover the entire dressing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with confirmed or suspected clinically infected reference wound.

          2. Reference wound undergoing treatment with compression therapy.

          3. Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the ALLEVYN Gentle Border.

          4. Participation in the treatment period of another clinical trial within 30 days of
             Visit 1 or planned participation overlapping with this study.

          5. Subjects with skin features (e.g. tattoos, skin color, pre-existing scarring) which,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with the study assessments.

          6. Subjects who have participated previously in this clinical trial.

          7. Subjects with a history of poor compliance with medical treatment.

          8. Subjects with a medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe subject participation in the study
