  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative inflammation is harmful in cancer patients, namely in those undergoing surgery:
      it increases the risk of recurrence, decreases cancer survival, increases post-operative
      complications, and prolongs the time of recovery and the duration of hospital stay. Severe
      postoperative complications are also a risk factor of poor survival in cancer patients.
      Seemingly, some effective therapies currently used to improve the surgical outcome (e.g.
      immunonutrition, enhanced-recovery protocols) have an inflammatory effect. The modulation of
      perioperative inflammation therefore seems crucial to improve outcomes in patients undergoing
      surgery for digestive cancer.

      A short perioperative treatment with high doses of corticosteroids has already been tested in
      several randomized trials. A recent meta-analysis showed that perioperative corticosteroids
      decreased inflammatory markers and might be associated with fewer complications in
      esophageal, liver, pancreatic and colorectal surgery: the decrease in the risk of
      postoperative complications was around 50% without adverse effects.
