    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride (CB-839 HCl)
      works in treating patients with specific genetic mutations and solid tumors or malignant
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Glutaminase converts an amino acid (building
      block of proteins) called glutamine to glutamate, which can support several cellular
      pathways. CB-839 works by blocking glutamine activity needed for the growth of cells. When
      this activity is blocked, the growth of cancer cells may stop and the cancer cells may then
      die. Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to genes that control the way cells function and
      uncontrolled cell growth may result in tumor formation. Specific genetic mutations studied in
      this clinical trial are NF1 mutation for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and NF1,
      KEAP1/NRF2, or STK11/LKB1 mutation for other solid tumors. CB-839 HCl may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the best overall response rate (BORR) achieved by 6 months of CB-839 HCl
      treatment in specific pathway aberrant tumors (MPNST, NF1, KEAP1/NRF2 &amp; STK11/ LKB1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and
      overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR) and clinical benefit
      rate (CBR) of CB-839 HCl.

      III. To assess pharmacodynamic changes and adaptive responses and correlate with response to
      treatment as well as disease progression (correlative objective).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18-F FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) pre-therapy and 8-weeks post-therapy response to CB-839 HCl therapy.

      II. Evaluate changes in level of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline,
      one month on-treatment and time of progression to treatment response.

      III. Quantify the peripheral blood concentrations of the metabolites: aspartate, glutamate,
      glutamine and arginine and correlate with response.

      IV. Evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of CB-839 HCl on systemic levels of the
      tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites in peripheral blood (baseline and one month) as
      part of the protocol.

      V. Evaluate tumor by reverse phase protein array and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (seq)
      to evaluate changes from pre-treatment, during treatment and post treatment specimens.

      VI. Perform patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) modelling-co-clinical trials to understand
      response/resistance mechanisms and also evaluate combination therapies for future
      development.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, then every 3 months
      thereafter.

          -  The effects of CB-839 HCl on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because anti-metabolic agents like CB-839 HCl are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of CB-839 HCl administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1)

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to CB-839 HCl

          -  Patients with glioma will be excluded

          -  Patients with active or prior history of hepatitis B or C will be excluded

          -  CB-839 HCl is a weak in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C9. Therefore, patients receiving any
             medications or substances that are substrates of CYP2C9 are eligible, but should use
             caution with substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. Because the lists of
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CB-839 HCl is anti-metabolic agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with CB-839 HCl, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with CB-839 HCl
