  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of free autologous dermal fat grafting (also called free
      dermal fat autografting) to treat complex craniofacial wounds that have failed standard
      treatment and to understand how well these grafts work to repair wounds long term. Patients
      who have undergone free autologous dermal fat grafting to treat complex craniofacial wounds
      less than 1 week ago will have photographs and small biopsies taken of the area that was
      grafted. Patients will be followed for 2 years to monitor the area that was grafted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A complex craniofacial wound is a wound on the head or face that will not heal, despite
      efforts to heal the wound with standard treatments, such as antibiotics and surgery to clean
      the wound. Currently, there are no good treatment options for these types of complex
      craniofacial wounds. This study will evaluate what happens when free dermal fat autografting
      is used to help treat complex craniofacial wounds by evaluating the area where the graft was
      placed to better understand how these types of grafts function. Free dermal fat autografting
      is the process of taking fat from under the outer layer of skin and moving it to another part
      of the body of the same individual. Although free dermal fat autografts have been used for
      many decades in plastic and reconstructive surgery to help a variety of patients suffering
      from different problems, only one study has used them to help heal complex craniofacial
      wounds. This use of free dermal fat autografting is not considered to be experimental or an
      investigational product by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Still, the use of free
      dermal fat autografting has not been formally evaluated to understand how these types of
      grafts help patients with complex craniofacial wounds.

      Prepared and stained slides made from the material obtained during biopsies will be retained
      for use in the clinical care of the patient and research. Other material stored in formalin
      from biopsy specimens obtained will be banked for future use in immunohistochemistry studies
      to further define free DFA physiology. Additional IRB approval to use any the material from
      biopsy specimens for any future studies will be obtained. The specimens will not be shared
      with outside researchers.

        Potential patients are any consecutive patients not part of a retrospective cohort who
        undergo free autologous dermal fat grafting for one or more complex craniofacial wounds,
        carried out by a single sub-speciality trained plastic surgeon (Study Principal
        Investigator).
