  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is the second leading cause of preventable death after smoking. The Evin law was
      built in 1991 with the goal of reducing exposure to alcohol marketing among the youngest. But
      this law is currently extremely weakened, and in a press release of February 26, 2018, the
      French Society of Alcoology is alarmed by these developments.

      Studies focusing on the impact of alcohol marketing focus largely on young adolescents, and
      the links between exposure to marketing and the initiation of alcohol. But beyond these
      links, there has been little work on the impact of alcohol marketing in vulnerable subjects
      with regular alcohol consumption. Consumption of alcohol is one of the first causes of
      hospitalization in France (Paille and Reynaud, 2015), the damage is often restricted to
      notions of dependency risks, but they can appear as soon as consumptions of 1 US / d (Guerin
      and Laplanche, 2013) and they mainly concern 45-64 year olds. To our knowledge, there are no
      studies on the impact of alcohol marketing conducted on regular alcohol users, depending on
      how they use alcohol (use, or use disorders). mild, moderate or severe) in patients enrolled
      in primary care and specialized addiction care.
