  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this China extension study, carboplatin and paclitaxel or nano particle albumin-bound
      paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) will be
      administered to Chinese adults with first line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      The primary hypotheses are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs: 1) Progression-free
      Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as
      assessed by a blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo, and 2) Overall Survival
      (OS) in Chinese participants.

      After analysis of interim results was conducted, the protocol was amended (Amendment 5) to
      allow participants the option to discontinue placebo in the control arm and to switch to
      pembrolizumab in the event of documented progressive disease as assessed by central review.

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of ≥1 new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review per RECIST 1.1 will be presented.</description>
