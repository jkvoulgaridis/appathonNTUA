    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the feasibility and efficacy of anti-CD19/BCMA
      bispecific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) T cell therapy for relapsed and refractory POMES
      Syndrome.

      Primary Objectives

      1. To determine the feasibility ad safety of anti-CD19/BCMA CAR-T cells in treating patients
      with relapsed and refractory POMES Syndrome.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To access the efficacy of anti-CD19/BCMA CAR-T cells in patients with POMES Syndrome.
