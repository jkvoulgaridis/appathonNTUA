    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and therapeutic
      activity of RO6874281 in combination with pembrolizumab. The study will consist of 3 parts: a
      safety run-in (Part I: Cohorts 1.1. and 1.2) and two expansion parts (Parts II and III). Part
      II will start once all participants in Cohort 1.1 have completed the observation period. Part
      III will start once all participants in Cohorts 1.1 and 1.2 have completed the observation
      period.
