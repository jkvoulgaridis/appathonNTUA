  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and serious complication of mechanical
      ventilation. Many studies have shown that the accumulation of subglottic secretions above the
      endotracheal cuff plays an important role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Subglottic secretion
      drainage (SSD) has been shown to be associated with a lower incidence of VAP in previous
      meta-analyses. Most studies in past reported that in the group of patients in whom
      endotracheal tube (ETT) was used and subglottic secretion drainage was applied compared to
      the group without subglottic secretion drainage.Very few studies compared two different
      methods of SSD,such as subglottic secretion lavage combined with aspiration or pure
      aspiration.The tubes need frequent cleaning as they often get blocked, especially the
      draining duct. This may be the reason why they are not commonly applied. However,subglottic
      secretion lavage combined with aspiration can reduce the incidence of tube blockage.So The
      purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of intermittent subglottic secretion
      lavage combined with aspiration preventing ventilator associated pneumonia in patients with
      severe neurological disease.

    <description>Ventilator-associated pneumonia preventive measures were applied to all patients according to VAP bundle. Subglottic secretion lavage combined with aspiration was performed every 4 hours: Underwent preoxygenation before cuff pressure checking, and was maintained between 30 and 35 cmH2O. After aspirating secretions from the mouth, nose, and airway, 2-5 mL distilled sterile water was instilled through the subglottic lumen, and then the negative pressure suction device is connected with the outer opening of the side cavity of endotracheal intubation for suction with a negative pressure of 100 mmHg, and each suction was kept under 15 seconds. Repeat lavage and aspiration until the irrigation fluid is clear. After washing, cuff pressure checking and was maintained between 25 and 30 cmH2O.</description>
