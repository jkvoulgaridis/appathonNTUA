  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to ensure the equity of the liver allocation process, it is important to create
      objective, scientifically validated markers of frailty in patients with end-stage liver
      disease that accurately predict patient outcomes. Many measures have been developed to assess
      this clinical state in elderly patients, but none have been applied to patients with
      cirrhosis, a population at increased risk for accelerated functional decline. This protocol
      is designed to learn more about the effects of functional status (also known as &quot;frailty&quot;) in
      liver transplant patients and patient outcomes both before and after liver transplant.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects in this study will be asked questions regarding functional status and ability to do
      activities at home. Subjects will also be asked to complete several physical tests to assess
      functional status. For example, subjects will be asked to stand up from a chair several
      times, balance with their feet together, and walk down a hall as quickly as possible.
      Subjects will also be asked to perform a hand grip strength test.

      Subjects will be assessed at baseline and at every clinic visit in the pre-transplant
      setting. Subjects will again be assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant.

    <measure>Fried Frailty Index measurements in 300 patients with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fried Frailty is calculated by combining into one score measurements of:
Exhaustion: number of days patient felt exhaustion in the past 7 days
Physical activity: has the subject performed any weight bearing activity in the past month? (Possible answers: yes or no).
Grip strength test using dynamometer: Three measurements reported in kg.
Walking speed in a 13-foot (4 meters) walk: Three measurements reported in seconds
Unintentional Weight Loss: report if patient has lost 10 lbs or more in the last year.
Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (MNLTPA) calculated as a value of 1 for males with MNLTPA score less than 383 kcal/week and for females with a score less than 270 kcal/week.
Range of score is 0 to 5 with 0 being not frail and 5 being most frail</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver Frailty Index measurements in 300 patients with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The following measurements are used individually to assess liver frailty index:
Chair stands: The patient stands up from a sitting position without using his/her arms. The time (in seconds) the patient requires to complete the task is reported.
Balance testing: patients must stand up in side by side, semi tandem and tandem positions for 10 seconds each. If the subject can't hold position for 10 seconds, the number of seconds that the subject kept in position is reported. Scoring range is 1.0 to 7.0 with 1.0 to 3.0 being &quot;robust&quot; and 4.5 to 7.0 being &quot;frail&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numbers Connection test measurements in 300 patients with end-stage liver disease</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient connects numbers that are scattered at random on a piece of paper. Reported as time (in seconds) taken to connect the numbers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities of daily living (ADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Six questions about daily activities Scoring: A response of yes to any of the questions receives a value of 1. the ADL score is measured as the sum of the values of the 6 questions. A score of 0 correlates with &quot;most dependent&quot; and a score of 6 is &quot;most independent.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Eight questions about daily activities:
Scoring: each question can be answered with a score of 0 or 1. The final iADL score is the sum of all values. The range of the score is 0 to 8 with 0 being most dependent and 8 being &quot;most independent.'</description>
