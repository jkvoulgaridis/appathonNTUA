  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop a registry of patients with adenosine deaminase
      severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) treated with Revcovi™ that contains clinical and
      biochemical assessments for safety and dose adjustment based on adenosine deaminase (ADA)
      activity and erythrocyte deoxyadenosine nucleotide (dAXP) levels as well as immunologic
      monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ADA-SCID who require treatment with Revcovi as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)
      will be enrolled during a 24-month period and each will be followed for 24 months after
      starting Revcovi or until undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or
      hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSC-GT), whichever occurs first. Patients undergoing
      HSCT or HSC-GT will be followed one month after last Revcovi dose and again at six months to
      assess adverse events (AEs) and survival. Throughout the duration of the study, patients will
      be assessed continually for AEs.

      Patients/Parents/Caregivers will self-administer weekly intramuscular (IM) dose(s) of Revcovi
      and will be followed according to the Suggested Schedule of Assessments for trough dAXP and
      ADA activity. Treatment dosing and monitoring will be individualized per provider and patient
      characteristics in adherence with each study sites' standards of care.

      Participants in the STP-2279-002 trial will be given the opportunity to enroll in this
      registry study and proceed to the Treatment Month 6 Visit per the Suggested Schedule of
      Assessments for Adagen-Transitioning Patients.

      An interim analysis will be performed approximately two years after study initiation.

    <description>Patients transitioning from Adagen: For patients currently receiving Adagen at ≤ 30 U/kg/wk or an unknown Adagen dose, the suggested dosage of Revcovi is 0.2 mg/kg/wk IM. For patients currently receiving Adagen at &gt; 30 U/kg/wk the suggested equivalent Revcovi dosage (mg/kg/wk) is the Adagen dosage in U/kg/wk divided by 150.
At the investigator's discretion, the total weekly dose may be divided and administered in multiple IM injections, increased by 0.033 mg/kg/wk if trough ADA activity is &lt; 30 mmol/hr/L, dAXP is &gt; 0.02 mmol/L, and/or the immune reconstitution is inadequate.
Adagen-naïve patients: The suggested starting Revcovi dosage is 0.2 mg/kg twice weekly IM based on ideal body weight, for a minimum of 12 to 24 weeks until immune reconstitution is achieved. At the investigator's discretion, the dosage may be gradually increased to maintain trough ADA activity &gt; 30 mmol/hr/L, dAXP &lt; 0.02 mmol/L, and/or to maintain adequate immune reconstitution.</description>
