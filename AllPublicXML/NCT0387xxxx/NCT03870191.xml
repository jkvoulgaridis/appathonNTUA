  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To see if there is there any difference in the treatment outcomes/results such as changes in
      pain intensity in patients with myofascial pain who have been treated with trigger point
      injections or twin block?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most treatment approaches for chronic myofascial pain are not evidence-based. Studies are
      usually controversial. Most are short-term, non-randomized. An essential limitation has been
      the lack of standardization of diagnosis. Some studies do not differentiate between joint
      pain and muscle pain, which can significantly affect the outcome of the treatment provided.

      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) was recently published and
      validated. Their protocol allows standardization of the assessment and diagnosis of patients
      with temporomandibular disorder, including myofascial pain.

      To the investigator's knowledge, no previous prospective, randomized study has been conducted
      demonstrating the treatment outcomes of either trigger point injections or twin block in
      patients with chronic myofascial pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with Myofascial pain with referral based on the DC/TMD criteria

          -  Pain on the masseter and or temporalis muscles

          -  Pain present for at least 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Generalized muscle disorder such as fibromyalgia

          -  Subjects on chronic pain medication

          -  Subjects who are known to have hypersensitivity to the local anesthetics.

          -  Pregnant women. A pregnancy test will not be given before subject enrollment. Women of
             childbearing ages will be asked verbally if they are pregnant. If they are unsure,
             then they will be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects with cognitive problems e.g. Alzheimer's disease.
