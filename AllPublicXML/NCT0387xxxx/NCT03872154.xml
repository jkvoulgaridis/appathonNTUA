  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomized, multicenter trial is designed to investigate the effect of
      checklist-guided shared decision-making including decision aids and communication of expected
      outcome on patients' decision regarding their code status, and at the same time, if it
      improves decision-making quality as judged by patient's decisional comfort, patient knowledge
      and involvement in decision-making and patient satisfaction. Patients in whom resuscitation
      is considered as futile will be treated separately in an ancillary project. In these patients
      a checklist to communicate the futility and the medical consequences will be used.

    <measure>Key secondary endpoint: Decisional conflict assessed by Decisional conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after code status discussion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' comfort with decision assessed through a validated German translation of the Decisional conflict Scale (DCS) The DCS is a 16 item-scale grouped into five sub-scales: certainty, information, clarification of values, external support or pressure and the patients perception of the quality of the decision process The score ranges from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict). According to literature, individuals whose scores are greater than 37.5 are uncomfortable with the decision and tend to delay it</description>

    <measure>Patients' involvement in shared decision-making process assessed by questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after code status discussion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' involvement in shared decision-making (SDM) process assessed via a validated German translation of the SDM-q-9 questionnaire
The SDM-q-9 is a 9-item instrument to measure the process of SDM in the medical consultation from the patients' perspective.</description>

    <measure>Patients' fears and concerns induced by code status discussion</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after code status discussion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' concerns brought up by the code status discussion e.g. general concerns, concern of suffering from a cardiac arrest, concern of being seriously ill, patient's perception of feeling under pressure to discuss code status, each rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' satisfaction with code status discussion and perceived quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after code status discussion</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with code status discussions and perceived quality e.g. satisfaction with discussion, perceived transparency of discussion, perceived comprehensibility of information, perceived right to be heard, how well questions were answered, perceived competence of resident, perceived resident's ability to listen to patient, each rated on a VAS 0-10</description>

    <measure>Patients' Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after code status discussion</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's Knowledge assessed by a Knowledge Assessment Questionnaire being used in previous studies This tool is a 6-item questionnaire with five true/false and one multiple choice question to assess patients understanding of resuscitation and medical care. Scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting greater knowledge</description>
