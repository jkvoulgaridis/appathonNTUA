  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel approach with a motor
      imagery-based exercise program versus conventional rehabilitative approach in fibromyalgia
      syndrome (FM): reduction of pain was set as the primary outcome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence about the therapeutic efficacy of exercise intervention programs in FM is still low
      and many authors suggested improving standardized exercise prescription for FM to achieve
      optimal results. In the literature, as an alternative approach, rehabilitative protocols in
      Group Music and Imagery seem to improve well-being and reduce anxiety in women with FM and
      suggest that Music and Imagery may help diminish pain intensity and depression. A
      rehabilitative approach should also consider the psychological and emotional aspects and,
      when possible, be accompanied by cognitive-behavioral therapy. The purpose of this research
      is to evaluate the possible efficacy of a novel approach with a motor imagery-based exercise
      program versus conventional rehabilitative approach in FM syndrome: the reduction of pain was
      set as the primary outcome as well as taking into account the patient's psychological and
      emotional condition. This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument to assess unidimensional measure of pain intensity. VAS was presented in a coloured scale with a middle point, graduations and numbers. Under the scale there was a straight horizontal line of fixed length, 100 mm. The ends were defined as the limits of the parameter to be measured (pain in the last 24 hours), orientated from the left (worst, no pain) to the right (best, worst pain to be imagined). The score is determined by measuring the distance (cm) on the 10 cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-10.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument to assess anxiety severity. The HAM-A was one of the first rating scales developed to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. It was administered by a clinician experienced in working with psychiatric patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Otherwise known as Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or HRSD-17. The patient is rated by a clinician on 21 items scored either on a 3-point or 5-point Likert-type scale. Although the form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. It generally takes 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal while a score of 20 or higher indicates at least moderate severity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument to assess alexithymia severity. The TAS is a 20-item instrument with 3 subscales: 1) difficulty Describing Feelings subscale, is used to measure difficulty describing emotions. 5 items; 2) difficulty Identifying Feeling subscale is used to measure difficulty identifying emotions. 7 items; 3) Externally-Oriented Thinking subscale, is used to measure the tendency of individuals to focus their attention externally. 8 items. The scale is a self-report scale that is comprised of 20 items. Items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale whereby 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. There are 5 items that are negatively keyed (items 4, 5, 10, 18 and 19). The total alexithymia score is the sum of responses to all 20 items, while the score for each subscale factor is the sum of the responses to that subscale. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All patients performed 10 treatment sessions, lasting 60 to 90 minutes, twice a week, in groups of three to four patients. The gold standard was to choose simple and safe exercises in order to encourage the patient to repeat the schedule at home. The exercises proposed in the MIG have been chosen respecting the following principles: slowness, painlessness, promoting attention, easy to imagine. The main purpose of motor imagery-based exercises was to bring the patient back to &quot;feeling and self-perceiving&quot; the execution of the movement. More than the &quot;quantity&quot; of repetition, the &quot;quality&quot; of the movement, free from pain, was important.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control rehabilitative Group (CG)</arm_group_label>

    <description>The CG received a conventional rehabilitation protocol, based on ten 1-hour sessions, held twice a week (over a 5-week period), previously investigated as efficient in FM by the authors and published. The exercises included low-to-moderate impact aerobic training, walking in a circle, alternating with periods of going up and down the stairs (3 steps for 10 minutes), for a total of 20 consecutive minutes, posture exercises for the back and proprioceptive exercises for the trunk, to improve axial stability. Each exercise was repeated 10 times (3 sets of 10), with a resting period of at least 3 minutes between sets. All sessions ended with stretching and diaphragmatic breathing exercises.</description>
