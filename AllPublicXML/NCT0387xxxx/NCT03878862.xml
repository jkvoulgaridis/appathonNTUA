    <textblock>
      The primary goal will be to compare the early postoperative recovery outcomes and
      complications from a series of surgical treatments for massive or irreparable rotator cuff
      tears. The secondary goal will be to assess factors that impact the outcomes of these
      reconstructions for irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears.

      Prospective, Non-Randomized Cohort Study The surgeons will decide which surgical
      reconstruction technique should be used to treat patients who have a massive (2+ tendons) or
      irreparable (Grade 3 or higher fatty infiltration into infraspinatus tendon) rotator cuff
      tear in the primary or revision setting. Surgical options include arthroscopic superior
      capsular reconstruction (SCR), arthroscopic assisted latissimus dorsi transfer (aaLDT), or
      arthroscopic assisted lower trapezius transfer (aaLTT), with arthroscopic biceps
      tendoesis/tenotomy as a control group.

      Each patient will receive an X-ray and MRI to indicate reparable subscapularis tear, teres
      minor pathology, grade of muscle fatty infiltration, AHI, CSA, Hamada grade, and arthritis
      grade.

      Patients will be assessed pre-operatively and again post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months, and 24 months to collect patient reported outcomes and complications.
      Assessments will include clinical and shoulder motion evaluations to gauge shoulder range of
      motion and pathology, as well as questionnaires that evaluate the patients shoulder mobility,
      ability, pain, and surgical satisfaction. Any adverse events post surgery will also be
      recorded at the defined assessment time intervals (6 wks, 3m, 6m, 12m, 24,m) and will
      specifically monitor temporary or permanent nerve injuries, hematomas, superficial and deep
      infections, recurrent moderate/severe pain, tendon or graft rupture, and humeral head
      superior migration.

      Graphical comparisons will be made of the patient's recovery for each surgical technique as
      well as an analysis of patient specific factors based on their demographics forms which could
      influence the recovery curves.
