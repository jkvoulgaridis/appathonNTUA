    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition and may be disabling and limiting quality
      of life (QoL) among aging women. POP may arise in the anterior (cystocele), posterior
      (rectocele) and middle compartment (apical POP) of the vagina. Apical POP includes descent of
      uterus or vaginal vault (if uterus was previously removed). The lifetime risk of undergoing a
      single operation for POP or urinary incontinence by age 80 is 11%. In Sweden, the risk to
      undergo 2 pelvic floor surgery is about 130 000 women. Traditional Surgical repairs of POP
      using native connective tissues are commonly used but the risk for POP recurrence is high if
      apical prolapse is present (ca 60%). Thus, minimal invasive surgical approaches by apical
      trans-vaginal mesh (A-TVM) and robotic sacral colpopexy (RSC) to support the vaginal apex
      (middle compartment) are in progress. 1 Evidence show effectivity and improved QoL after
      surgery.

      Vaginal and robotic accesses may be available to many patients. Vaginal approach may allow
      surgeon to perform surgery for all POP compartments and perineal injury in one single surgery
      opportunity. Contra-indications for general anesthesia and some abdominal diseases or
      conditions may dismiss the robotic surgery. In contrast, all patients can be operated via the
      vaginal approach except for patient unwellness. Thus, a direct low cost of vaginal surgery
      may be possible. In the other hand, costs for robotic surgery are high. Whether or not this
      may be reflected on cost-effectiveness based on QoL improvement after surgery has not yet
      been studied.

      Visualising synthetic implants i.e. POP mesh and the Tension-Free Vaginal Tape (TVT) implant
      for urinary incontinence (UI) by ultrasonography (US) has been a subject for some studies.
      Using US, localisation of the TVT in correlation to urinary bladder neck and how close to
      urethra may explain outcomes after TVT surgery. Given its importance, knowledge of how mesh
      anatomical position may influence outcomes, it may be useful in further POP surgery
      development. Our results indicate that US can be used and is reproducible in mapping of A-TVM
      (manuscript).

      Growing need worldwide is to have more cost-effective and safe health care.
      Cost-effectiveness, safety, outcomes, POP-recurrence and effects on pelvic floor dysfunction
      have not yet been directly compared between vaginal and robotic mesh surgery for apical POP.

      Topic: Cost-Effectiveness (Vaginal vs robotic POP mesh surgery), QoL, safety and outcomes.

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness measurements and comparison between vaginal and robotic mesh surgery for apical prolapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline an up to 1, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness analysis: cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by comparing the vaginal approach with the robotic approach in term of incremental costs and incremental benefits (measured by QALYs gained).15 The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) gives the marginal cost for each additional QALY gained by treating a patient using the robotic approach compared to the vaginal approach. To evaluate cost-effectiveness, the ICER must be compared with a reference willingness to pay (WTP) value. Sweden has no such official number, but the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom states a willingness to pay between 20,000 - 30,000 British pounds. If the ICER is below this threshold, the robotic approach will be considered cost-effective compared to the vaginal approach.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of anatomical outcomes by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system (POP-Q): vaginal mesh utero-/colpopexy vs Robotic Sacral Colpopexy</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline an up to 3 months, 1, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Grading of genital prolapse will be performed using the pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system which is a quantitative method for the assessment of vaginal topography and conforms to the standards recommended by the International Continence Society as described by Bump et al. (Am J Obstetrics Gynecology1996). Postoperative examinations are to be performed by the trial gynecologist with the patient in a supine position. Prolapse of the middle compartment equivalent to, or more, than 50% of the total vaginal length (TVL) (i.e. point C positioned at, or distal to, a point between the hymen and half the total vaginal length) is required for inclusion of a patient in the trial.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of generic quality of Life (QoL) by The 15D instrument of health-related quality of Life (15D): vaginal mesh utero-/colpopexy vs Robotic Sacral</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline an up to15 days, 3,6&amp;9 months, 1-5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 15D is a generic, comprehensive, self-administered, 15-dimensional, preference-based questionnaire. The 15D includes 15-dimensions: mobility, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech (communication), excretion, usual activity, mental function, discomfort, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual functions. Each dimension has five descriptive levels to choose from. The 15D can be used as a profile and a single index score measure. The valuation system is based on the application of multi-attribute utility theory. The single index or utility score represents the generic health-related quality of life on a maximum value of 1 (full health) to lower bound of 0 (being dead). From the 15D, the generic minimal important change (MIC) can be calculated to indicate improvement or deterioration. Also, he quality adjusted life-year (QALY) is evaluated using the estimated 15D values preoperative and after surgery.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of pelvic floor symptoms by Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20): vaginal mesh utero-/colpopexy vs Robotic Sacral</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline an up to15 days, 3,6&amp;9 months, 1-5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PFDI-20 is both a symptom inventory and a measure of the degree of bother and distress (quality-of-life) caused by pelvic floor symptoms. It is a short-form version of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory. The questionnaire has been validated for use in pelvic reconstructive surgery and has proven sensitive to change.
The PFDI-20 includes 20 questions and 3 scales. Each of the 3 scales is scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress). The sum of the scores of these 3 scales serves as the overall summary score of the PFDI-20 and ranges from 0 - 300. The 3 scales include questions taken from the following widely used outcome measures: Urinary Distress Inventory - 6 questions, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory - 6 questions, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory - 8 questions.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of sexual function by Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire (PISQ-12): vaginal mesh utero-/colpopexy vs Robotic Sacral</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline an up to15 days, 3,6&amp;9 months, 1-5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The validated PISQ-12 is a condition-specific, 12-item questionnaire on sexual function, with ordinal response alternatives based on a 5-point Likert scale. The PISQ-12 correlates well with other sexual health questionnaires and has shown sensitivity to change after pelvic reconstructive surgery and predictability of scores using the unabridged PISQ (31 items). The specific questions can be combined to form a score where higher scores indicate better sexual function. The maximum PISQ-12 score is 48. The twelve questions of the PISQ-12 can be divided into three domains: behavioral-emotive, partner-related and physical.</description>
