  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies in the field of health and HIV indicate that threat appraisal is associated with poor
      adherence to treatment, anxiety, poor quality of life, avoidance behavior, less
      antiretroviral adherence, negative affect, social, instrumental and emotional stress,
      depression, global distrés, poor subjective health and psychological distres. Most
      psychological interventions have been oriented to behavioral aspects, leaving aside cognitive
      aspects such as threat appraisal, so is necessary to investigate psychological treatments and
      its impact in threat appraisal an in an clinical and psychological outcomes.

      Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to
      decrease threat appraisal in comparison with Usual Care (UC) in HIV patients initiating
      antiretroviral treatment at week 8.

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the effect of a cognitive behavioral therapy intervention
      compared with Usual Care in HIV patients initiating antiretroviral treatment in the following
      variables: challenge appraisal, affect (positive and negative), adherence, quality of life,
      anxiety and depression, HIV viral load and loss to follow-up at weeks 8, 20 and 52.

      Exploratory objectives: To assess the threat appraisal cut-off value that predicts favorable
      outcomes in adherence, virologic suppression, retention in care and adverse events at week
      52.

      The study is an open label, single center, parallel group clinical trial, in which 50
      participants will be randomly assigned using a blocked design to one of the 2 arms: Usual
      Care (single individual psycho-educative session) or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Usual care
      + 6 sessions of individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). The sample will be conformed with
      50 adults with HIV, naïve to ARV treatment, starting care at INCMNSZ, who have scores of
      threat appraisal ≥40 in the CEAT scale, without severe mental disorders or cognitive
      impairment. We will use independent t test and chi square and intention to treat analysis for
      the primary outcome, also for secondary outcomes t student for continuous variables, chi
      square for categorical variables and per protocol analysis in participants adherent to the
      intervention.
