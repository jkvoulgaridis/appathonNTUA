  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study of the tolerance and acceptability of a extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF)
      containing pre- and probiotics will assess gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance, product intake
      and acceptability in 40 infants (aged &lt;13 months) currently using or requiring an extensively
      hydrolysed formula for the dietary management of CMA. Patients already prescribed an eHF (or
      other appropriate feed for CMA) at time of recruitment will undertake a 3 day baseline period
      in which their current symptoms, compliance, GI tolerance and acceptability towards their
      current feed is assessed, before introducing the study product for a period of 4 weeks.
      Patients who are not on an eHF (or other appropriate feed for CMA) at baseline will forgo
      this 3 day baseline period and immediately introduce the study product for 4 weeks.

    <measure>Change in gastrointestinal tolerance from baseline to intervention day 28: questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>31 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gastro-intestinal tolerance will be recorded by the parent on Baseline Days 1-3 (where this period is undertaken by the patient) and on Intervention Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 26, 27, and 28. Tolerance will be recorded using a standardised gastro-intestinal tolerance questionnaire, to be completed by the parents/carer</description>

    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>31 days</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance with feed prescription will be assessed daily throughout the study by recording how much feed was received. The amount prescribed by the Dietitian will be recorded at the start of the study, and any changes to this prescription also noted. During the baseline period (where this is undertaken) the compliance of the patient's usual feed will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Parent-reported Atopic Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>31 days</time_frame>
    <description>Recorded via visual analogue scales at baseline and at the end of each week. Parents will record on a 100mm line the severity of a number of common atopic symtpoms, with the scale running from &quot;not at all/none&quot; at 0mm and &quot;as bad as possible/</description>

    <time_frame>31 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nutrient intake, including the intake of all nutrition provided (including the study product, any other enteral tube feeding, foods, drinks etc.) will be recorded via a 24hr dietary recall, conducted by the Dietitian at the Baseline Visit and at the End of Study Visit.</description>
