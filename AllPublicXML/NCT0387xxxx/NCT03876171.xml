      Florida study is a unique intervention that will develop and implement a culturally-specific,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haitian youth in Miami-Dade County who become part of the juvenile justice system have not
      received culturally appropriate remediating or rehabilitative attention by that system. This
      study will modify a specific variety of intervention, the Culturally Informed and Flexible
      Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) for appropriateness in Miami's Haitian
      cultural contexts. This study will develop and implement a culturally specific, integrated
      family and individual-based, drug use, sexual risk and delinquency risk reduction program for
      Haitian adolescents aged 13-17 in Miami-Dade County, Florida.
