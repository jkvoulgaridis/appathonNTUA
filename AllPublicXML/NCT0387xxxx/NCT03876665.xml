  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the experience of living with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) as an active duty Service Woman. As part of a budding research program, this
      proposed study will lay the groundwork for future intervention studies targeting the
      management of PCOS in a military population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a qualitative descriptive approach with focus groups (FG) and individual interviews
      (II), the investigators will seek to describe the experience of living with PCOS as an active
      duty service woman (ADSW). This method will allow the investigators to obtain a comprehensive
      summary of living with PCOS in the every day terms of ADSW. The discussion in the (FG)
      meetings will be an effective way to supply information about what people think, or how they
      feel, or on the way they act. Advantages of this method include: (a) it can cover a large
      number of people in one session, (b) it is an efficient way of gaining a large amount of
      information in a short time, (c) it is comparatively easier to drive or conduct, and (d) it
      generates an opportunity to collect data from the group interaction, which concentrates on
      the topic of the researcher's interest [64, 65].

      This proposed study will focus on six primary areas of inquiry: (a) experience of receiving
      PCOS diagnosis (b) symptoms experienced and methods of coping with them, (c)
      military-specific experience of managing and living with PCOS, (d) access to/availability of
      information related to PCOS and how they have applied it, (e) experience of support, and (f)
      present and future concerns about having PCOS.

Up to three focus groups per service branch will be conducted.
