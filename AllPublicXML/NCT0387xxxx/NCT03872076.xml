  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The improvement of strength affects muscle volume, dynamic stability and sports
      performance in water polo athletes. Plyometric exercises can improve biomechanics,
      performance and the most explosive actions during sports. The work done with elastic bands
      will increase the effectiveness and the resistance on the isometric exercises developed.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of plyometric exercises in the increase of
      quadriceps muscle strength, volume and stability dynamic in female athletic of water polo
      players from 18 to 25 years old.

      Study Design: A randomized, multicentric, single-blind clinical study with a follow-up
      period.

      Methodology: 25 water polo players will be recruited and randomly assigned to the two study
      groups: experimental (plyometric exercises plus isometric exercises with elastic bands) and
      control (isometric exercises with elastic bands). The intervention will last for 8 weeks,
      with 3 weekly sessions, of 15 minutes each. The study variables will be: strength (measured
      with the RM test), muscle volume (using anthropometry), and dynamic stability (through the
      SEBT test). The analysis of normality will be carried out with the Shapiro Wilk test. In case
      of homogeneity of the groups, we will use parametric tests: t-student test of repeated
      measures (difference between evaluations) and ANOVA of repeated means (intra and intersubject
      effect).

      Expected Results: It is expected to observe improvement in muscle strength and quadriceps
      volume, as well as dynamic stability.

    <description>Researchers will use the 1RM test to measure maximum strength by trial and error, taking into account the nRM (number of repetitions) performing a repetition for each series without exceeding 15 maximum repetitions, or even be effective in less than 10 maximum repetitions increasing the load in each series progressively, depending on the abilities of the athletes. We will perform 5 minutes of light activities, then one minute of stretching, heating of eight repetitions to 50% of 1RM, followed by three repetitions at 70% of 1RM. After 5 minutes of the interval, the 1RM test will be performed. The weight will increase progressively 5kg, three to five times until the maximum RM. The assessment of quadriceps muscle strength will be assessed through the full squat exercise. The unit of measurement is the Kg, indicating a greater amount of Kg, a greater maximum force in quadriceps</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>A metric tape will be used as a measuring instrument to assess muscle volume of quadriceps. Once the segment to be assessed is identified, we will make the assessment with the athlete in standing position. A mark will be made on the upper edge of the patella, and another one at 10 centimeters in the same plane of movement, in caudal-cranial direction. The evaluation will be carried out by measuring the entire contour on the marked lines, thus defining the different perimeters. This test has the centimeter (cm) as the unit of measurement. The higher the score, the more muscle volume the subject reflects in the valued segment.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline dynamic stability after treatment and at month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the dynamic stability will be carried out through the use of the Star Excursion Balance Test. With the patient in a standing position, squatting on a limb without support will be requested. On the ground, 8 lines will be marked with a separation between them of 45 degrees forming a star. Data will be obtained in different planes (anterior, anterolateral, medial, posteromedial, posterolateral and posterior). The athlete must establish a stable base at the point of support and keep it in all directions, while trying to touch the lines with the most distal part of the foot and return to the starting position. This scale has the centimeter as a unit of measurement: the higher the score in centimeters, the more dynamic stability the athlete presents.</description>

    <description>The Drom Jump technique with the legs flexed will be performed with the patient standing in front of a bench 30 cm high by 100 cm wide. The physiotherapist will be placed lateral to the athlete. The subject will be asked to jump up from the box or bench, with the hip and knees in semi-reflexion, with his hands on his hip and he will be asked for an explosive jump, followed by a jump downwards falling the floor of the same way.
The technique of lateral jumps on cones will be carried out by means of unipodal jumps, achieving a distance of 50 cm between cones. The physiotherapist will stand in front of the athlete. The subject will be asked to perform a lateral unipodal explosive jump by flexing the hip and knee.</description>

    <description>Elastic bands will be combined with isometric exercises in 3 sets of 10 repetitions each. The exercises they will perform are front squat. On the one hand, separating the legs at the height of the shoulders with hip and knee flexion, with the elastic band above the knees, maintaining the position 20 seconds.
In the following exercise, with the elastic band on the ankle, in unipodal support at the same time that the contralateral limb is free of support, the hip will be flexed at 45º with full knee extension, requesting the athlete to keep the tension 20 seconds, performing 3 sets of 10 repetitions.</description>
