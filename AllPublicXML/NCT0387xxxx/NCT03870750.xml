      This phase II/III trial studies the best approach in improving quality of life and survival
      after a donor stem cell transplant in older, weak, or frail patients with blood diseases.
      Patients who have undergone a transplant often experience increases in disease and death. One
      approach, supportive and palliative care (SPC), focuses on relieving symptoms of stress from
      serious illness and care through physical, cultural, psychological, social, spiritual, and
      ethical aspects. While a second approach, clinical management of comorbidities (CMC) focuses
      on managing multiple diseases, other than cancer, such as heart or lung diseases through
      physical exercise, strength training, stress reduction, medication management, dietary
      recommendations, and education. Giving SPC, CMC, or a combination of both may work better in
      improving quality of life and survival after a donor stem cell transplant compared to
      standard of care in patients with blood diseases.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare in a randomized phase II study the effectiveness of supportive and palliative
      care, a clinical multi-modal program, or a combined approach versus usual care only (UCO) to
      determine the winning arm in improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (Day-90
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant [FACT-BMT] scores) for
      vulnerable recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (Phase II) II.
      Compare in a randomized phase III study the effectiveness of the winning arm from the
      preceding phase II study versus UCO in improving HRQOL (Day-90 FACT-BMT scores) and/or
      overall survival at 1-year for vulnerable recipients of allogeneic HCT. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rates of overall survival. (Phase II and III) II. Cumulative incidences of non-relapse
      mortality (NRM). (Phase II and III) III. Cumulative incidences of relapse. (Phase II and III)
      IV. Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS). (Phase II and III) V. Cumulative incidence of
      frailty. (Phase II and III) VI. Cumulative incidence of disability. (Phase II and III) VII.
      Cumulative incidence of grades III-IV cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary and renal toxicities
      according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4. (Phase II) VIII. Use of resources
      within first 90 days after HCT: Frequency of hospitalization. (Phase II and III) IX. Use of
      resources within first 90 days after HCT: Duration of each hospitalization. (Phase II and
      III) X. Use of resources within first 90 days after HCT: Number and duration of admissions to
      intensive care unit. (Phase II and III) XI. Use of resources within first 90 days after HCT:
      Days out of hospital alive (DOHA). (Phase II and III)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo SPC on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.

      ARM II: Patients undergo a CMC program on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.

      ARM III: Patients undergo interventions as outlined in Arm I and Arm II.

      ARM IV: Patients receive standard of care.

      In all arms, patients undergo HCT on day 0 and complete questionnaires and surveys at
      enrollment and 30, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT. In all arms patients complete a 4-meter
      walk test, 6-minute walk test, up and go test, measured strength test and cognitive
      assessment at enrollment, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable patients as defined by one or more of the following criteria

               -  Age 65 years or older

               -  Having Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation - Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) scores of
                  &gt;= 3 (for patients that could be 20 years old and older)

               -  Having frailty as determined by walk speed of &lt; 0.8 m/s using 4-meter walk test
                  (for patients that could be 40 years old and older)

          -  Patients considered or referred for allogeneic HCT to treat a hematological malignant
             or non-malignant disease

          -  Able to speak and read English - interaction with the interventionist trainer and
             endpoint measurement must occur in English

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  Stated willingness to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements

          -  Planned allogeneic HCT within 3 weeks - all types of donors and all sorts of
             conditioning regimens are allowed. Patients with suspected active disease (relatively
             old disease staging or relatively old intervention) or significant comorbidity (e.g.
             suspicious untreated pulmonary nodules) based on prior evaluations, that could delay
             the transplant would be considered for enrollment within a tighter window (10-14 days
             before allogeneic HCT) to allow for completed pre-HCT work-up evaluations that would
             confirm readiness to proceed with transplant

          -  Able to exercise at low to moderate intensity

          -  Adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, as judged by data from the patient's electronic
             medical record as to whether a patient could walk up one flight of stairs, no need for
             supplemental oxygen, and/or physician judgment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Orthopedic, neurologic or other problems which prevent safe ambulation and protocol
             adherence. Information on prior falls and other recent orthopedic or neurologic
             problems will be used to make judgment about protocol eligibility

          -  Participation in another intervention clinical trial with HRQOL as a primary endpoint

          -  Planned donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 90 days post-transplant

          -  Planned anti-cytotoxic therapies, other than tyrosine kinase inhibitors or
             single-agent monoclonal antibody, or FLT-3 inhibitors within 90 days of
             post-transplant unless pre-approved by the protocol principal investigator (PI)
