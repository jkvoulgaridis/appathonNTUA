    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single
      escalating doses of AGN-151587 (EDIT-101) administered via subretinal injection in
      participants with LCA10 caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation involving
      c.2991+1655A&gt;G in intron 26 of the CEP290 gene (&quot;LCA10-IVS26&quot;).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single ascending dose study of AGN-151587 (EDIT-101) in adult and
      pediatric (ie, ages 3 to 17) participants with LCA10-IVS26. Approximately 18 participants
      will be enrolled in up to 5 cohorts to evaluate up to 3 dose levels of AGN-151587 in this
      study. AGN-151587 is a novel gene editing product designed to eliminate the mutation on the
      CEP290 gene that results in the retinal degeneration that defines LCA10-IVS26.
