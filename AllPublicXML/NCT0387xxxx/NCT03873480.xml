  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting this study to determine if administration of local anesthetic to the thumb
      prior to surgery can reduce the amount of anesthetic gas given during the course of surgery.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome will be the difference in observed pain scores during the post-operative period following a trigger thumb surgery between the control group and intervention group. The FLACC (face, legs, activity, consolability) Behavioural pain scale will be used. There are 5 components, e.g. face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability, that are given a grade of 0, 1, or 2. The sum of the each component grade will give the pain scale score.
0 = Relaxed and comfortable 1-3 = Mild discomfort 4-6 = Moderate pain 7-10 = Severe discomfort/pain</description>

    <description>Participants randomized into the intervention group will receive an injection of 2.5 cc of 0.25% marcaine without epinephrine prior to the incision. The local anesthetic will be administered by the treating surgeon. All other aspects of the procedure will be kept in accordance with the standard of care for trigger thumb surgeries.</description>

    <description>Those that are not randomized into the intervention group will receive the standard of care for a trigger thumb release, which is administration of 2.5 cc of 0.25% marcaine without epinephrine following completion of surgery. The local anesthetic will be administered by the treating surgeon.</description>
