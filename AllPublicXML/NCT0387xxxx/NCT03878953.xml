    <description>Participants will receive a SC injection of initial dose of 50 mcg of rhPTH(1-84) once daily (QD) in the thigh (alternate thigh every day). If albumin-corrected serum calcium (ACSC; [mg/dL] = serum calcium [mg/dL] +0.8*[4-serum albumin (g/dL)]) is &gt;2.25 mmol/L (&gt;9.0 mg/dL), a starting dose of 25 mcg will be considered. At 4 week intervals the rhPTH(1-84) dose may be increased in 25 mcg increments to a maximal dose of 100 mcg SC QD. At any time during the study as needed for safety reasons, rhPTH(1-84) doses may be decreased in 25 mcg decrements to a minimum of 25 mcg QD. If the ACSC is &gt;2.97 mmol/L (&gt;11.9 mg/dL), then the investigational product should be stopped until the calcium level is corrected.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has signed and dated the informed consent form.

          -  The participant is an adult male or female 20 to 85 years of age inclusive.

          -  The participant is living in Japan and is Japanese; in this case, Japanese is defined
             as having been born in Japan, with Japanese parents, and Japanese maternal and
             paternal grandparents.

          -  The participant has a diagnosis of chronic hypoparathyroidism with an onset of 18
             months or more prior to screening. The diagnosis is based on historical biochemical
             evidence of hypocalcemia in the setting of a concomitant inappropriately low serum
             intact parathyroid hormone (PTH). If such evidence is not available the diagnosis of
             chronic hypoparathyroidism must be confirmed by the Shire medical monitor based on
             other compelling medical history.

          -  The participant has been treated with active vitamin D therapy with alfacalcidol
             greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 microgram (mcg) per day (or an equivalent dose of
             calcitriol of &gt;=0.5 mcg per day or falecalcitriol &gt;=0.3 mcg per day) prior to
             baseline.

          -  The participant has indicated a willingness and ability to perform daily subcutaneous
             (SC) self-injections of study medication (or will have a designee, ie, a family member
             or caregiver, to perform injections).

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to comply with the contraceptive
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  The participants who are less than (&lt;) 25 years old demonstrate radiological evidence
             of epiphyseal closure at screening based on bone age X-ray (single posteroanterior
             X-ray of the left wrist and hand).

          -  The participant meets 1 of the following criteria:

               1. If not receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the participant has a serum
                  thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level within normal laboratory limits at
                  screening.

               2. If receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the dose must have been stable
                  for at least 3 months prior to screening and serum TSH level within the reference
                  range for the laboratory.

          -  The participant has a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level &gt;=50 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L) (20
             nanogram per milliliter [ng/mL]) and &lt; upper limit of normal (ULN) of the laboratory
             reference range.

          -  The participant has a serum creatinine laboratory value of &lt;132.6 micromoles per liter
             (mcmoles/L) (1.5 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]).

          -  The participant has a serum magnesium level within the laboratory reference range at
             baseline.

          -  The participant is not adequately controlled with standard therapy within 6 months of
             screening based upon the opinion of the investigator and approval by the sponsor's
             medical monitor. For example:

               1. Hypocalcemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium &lt;8.0 mg/dL) or

               2. Hypercalciuria (urine calcium [mg/dL]/creatinine [mg/dL] ratio &gt;0.4 or 24 hour
                  urine calcium excretion &gt;7.5 millimoles (mmol) [300 milligram {mg}]/24 hours in
                  men and &gt;6.25 millimoles (mmol) [250 mg]/24 hours in women) or,
