  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter
      induction study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral
      BT-11 induction compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe CD. Approximately 70
      sites will participate from Europe and the United States (US).

      A total of 130 male and female subjects with moderate to severe CD (CDAI Score 220-450; a
      patient-reported outcome (PRO-2) stool frequency (SF) score ≥ 4 and/or abdominal pain (AP) ≥
      2, and a Simplified Endoscopic Index of Severity of Chron's Disease (SES-CD) scored ≥ 6 (≥ 4
      for isolated ileitis) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive BT-11 1,000 mg or placebo.
      Each of the treatment arms will comprise 65 subjects. The randomization will be stratified by
      prior exposure to biologic therapy for CD (yes/no) and corticosteroid use at baseline
      (yes/no). The study consists of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week induction phase, and a
      2-week post-treatment safety follow-up period.
