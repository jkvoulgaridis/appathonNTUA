      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-exploratory phase II
      clinical trial to evaluating the efficacy and safety of Felbinac Trometamol Injection in the
      treatment of moderate to severe pain after surgery.Main purpose is preliminary evaluation the
      effectiveness of Felbinac Trometamol Injection in the treatment of moderate and severe pain
      after surgery.Secondary purpose is to explore the dosage regimen of Felbinac Trometamol
      Injection in the treatment of moderate and severe pain after surgery, and provide data
      support for later clinical trial.
