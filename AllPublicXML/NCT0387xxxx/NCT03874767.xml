  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The change in Medicare payment for Surgical Hip and Femur Fracture Treatment (SHFFT) patients
      gave hospitals an incentive to provide higher quality care to this cohort of patients. The
      practice of post-operative early ambulation has been shown to improve outcomes by promoting
      enhanced recovery after surgery in a variety of patients, include those with SHFFT. To that
      end, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) is establishing a &quot;Culture of Mobility&quot;. To
      do so, additional personnel are being hired to help ambulate patients with traumatic hip and
      femur fractures, and other fractures of the lower extremity long bones, based upon the best
      available evidence supporting mobility programs. The added personnel are needed as the
      currently available resources have insufficient bandwidth to ensure complete early mobility
      for all patients. The relative effectiveness of adding a dedicated resource is assumed.
      Although the literature suggests adding person-hours increases the amount of mobility
      achieved, there is an opportunity to evaluate whether this is really the case.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of adding the mobility technician to the
      usual care team in order to assist patients who could benefit from early ambulation after
      surgery. We hypothesize that adding a dedicated mobility technician increases the proportion
      of prescribed early ambulation provided to all eligible patients post-surgery, improves
      functional independence at discharge, and decreases length of stay since patients achieve
      readiness for discharge sooner than without early mobility.

    <description>The primary outcome for this study will be length of stay (LOS), defined as time from admission to the unit to discharge from the unit in days. The LOS will be obtained for this study from the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function Independence Measurement (FIM) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At discharge (usually less than 1 week after admission)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient function is assessed using the FIMâ„¢ instrument at the start of a rehabilitation episode of care and at the end of a rehabilitation episode of care. Admission assessment is collected within 72 hours of the start of a rehabilitation episode. Discharge assessment is collected within 72 hours prior to the end of a rehabilitation episode.
The FIM score measures a patient's mobility. The score ranges from 6 to 24, where 6 means most limited mobility and 24 means normal mobility.</description>

    <measure>Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At discharge (usually less than 1 week after admission)</time_frame>
    <description>The JH-HLM scale was developed based on input from multiple disciplines (nursing, rehabilitation therapists, physicians, etc.) to help record the mobility that a patient actually does, standardize the description of patient mobility, and to be used as a performance measure for quality improvement projects.
The JH-HLM score measures a patient's mobility. The score ranges from 1 to 8, where 1 means most limited mobility and 8 means normal mobility.</description>

    <description>The unit in this arm will be assigned physical therapists plus mobility technicians in the first month and only physical therapists in the following month.
During months where a unit has been assigned the mobility technicians, the mobility technician, along with nursing staff, will deliver additional prescribed mobility as well as standard-of-care prescribed therapy provided by physical therapy staff:
On evaluation, a PT will assign a JH-HLM scale rating to the patient
If the score is 4 or higher, the PT will add the patient to the mobility technician patient list
The mobility technician will then see that patient daily, unless the score is &lt;4
Each PT session will involve a re-assessment by the PT of the JH-HLM scale rating as well as the Function Independence Measurement (FIM) score, and subsequently will update the recommended therapy if appropriate
The mobility technician will work with PT and nursing to determine the best time to deliver mobility</description>

    <description>A team of two mobility technicians will switch between two units on a monthly basis. The unit staffed by the mobility technician will be referred to as the intervention unit, while the other will be referred to as the control unit. One unit will start as the control unit and will switch to being the intervention unit after one month. Similarly, the other unit will start as the intervention unit and will switch to becoming the control unit after one month. All patients present on a unit during the intervention period will be provided mobility technician support according to standardized clinical guidelines that have been developed by the care team and described below. Patients who are present on a unit at the time of cross-over will not be included in the analysis, but will either no longer receive mobility technician support (if crossing from intervention to control) or will start to receive mobility technician support (if switching from control to intervention).</description>
