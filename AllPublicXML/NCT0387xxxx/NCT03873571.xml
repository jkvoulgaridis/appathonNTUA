  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemia is the most common disease,
      affecting &gt;1.5 billion people worldwide. Furthermore, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) accounts
      for 50% of cases of anemia. IDA is common during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and can
      lead to serious maternal and fetal complications. Measurement of serum ferritin has the
      highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of IDA unless there is a concurrent
      inflammatory condition. The lower threshold value for hemoglobin (Hb) in pregnant women is
      &lt;11 g/dL during the 1st and 3rd trimesters, and &lt;10.5 g/dL during the 2nd trimester. In
      postpartum period a Hb concentration &lt;10 g/dL indicates clinically significant anemia. Oral
      iron therapy is given as the first-line treatment for IDA.

      Measurement of serum ferritin has the highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of
      IDA unless there is a concurrent inflammatory condition. The lower threshold value for
      hemoglobin (Hb) in pregnant women is &lt;11 g/dL during the 1st and 3rd trimesters, and &lt;10.5
      g/dL during the 2nd trimester. In postpartum period a Hb concentration &lt;10 g/dL indicates
      clinically significant anemia.

      Oral iron therapy is given as the first-line treatment for IDA. There are several direct and
      indirect methods to assess adherence to medications, each method has advantages and limits.
      Many studies have shown that pill counting is more accurate than self-reported adherence.We
      will investigate the adherence to iron supplementation in pregnant women by using a
      self-reported adherence questionnaire named SMAQ (Simplified Medication Adherence
      Questionnaire)

      Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) Knobel H; Juega J; Carmona A; Kindelan
      JM; Ruiz I; Gonzalez J; Collazos J; Casado JL; Alonso J; Ocampo A SMAQ is used to assess
      non-adherent patients. The six-item SMAQ has been developed to assess adherence in
      HIV-infected patients, and may be applied in most clinical settings.
