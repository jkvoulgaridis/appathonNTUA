  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a major public health issue despite therapeutic advances, it is the first
      cause of death cancer of women in Europe.

      Several treatments may be proposed depending on the general condition of the patient, the
      characteristics of the initial tumor and the stage of the disease. The different treatments
      in metastatic relapse of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer are systemic treatments,
      such as hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and possible supportive care, but
      also in some cases local treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy.

      Comparative analysis of primary mammary tumors and their metastases has demonstrated the
      essential role of tumor heterogeneity, both in time and space, in the progression of the
      disease and the occurrence of resistance to treatments. Taking into account this intratumoral
      heterogeneity represents a major axis of improvement in the management of patients with
      breast cancer.

      The use of innovative radiotracers such as 16α- [18F] -fluoro-17β-estradiol (FES) may allow
      in the future to better evaluate this tumor heterogeneity in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer through non-metastatic characterization. invasive different lesions. It will be
      possible to propose to each patient a more personalized care with possibly the
      administration, in addition to the systemic treatment, of a local treatment adapted to the
      characteristics of some secondary lesions likely to respond less well to the systemic
      treatment.

      In this pilot study, the investigators would like to estimate the number of patients and the
      number of metastatic sites affected by tumor heterogeneity of estrogen receptor expression,
      which could benefit from specific management.

      This study will concern a population of patients with first metastatic recurrence of hormone
      receptor-positive breast cancer initially, with at least one metastasis, who are candidates
      for treatment with hormone therapy.

      The main objective of this pilot study is to determine the unconformity rates for estrogen
      receptor expression in different metastatic lesions in patients with first metastatic
      recurrence of breast cancer initially expressing estrogen receptors.

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. To study the influence of the FES PET could have for possible modifications of
           therapeutic management in these patients.

        2. Determine the rate of patients with additional positive FES lesions but without positive
           FDG lesions.

        3. Evaluate the response to chemotherapy at 3 months after using FDG-PET in clinical
           routine.
