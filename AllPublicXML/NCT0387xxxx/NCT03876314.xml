  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and Alzheimer's disease (PAAD-2) is a randomized control trial that will
      assess the effects of exercise on middle-aged (40-65 years) cognitively normal adults who
      have a heightened risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to family history (FH+). The
      investigators will also assess the extent to which this effect is moderated by apolipoprotein
      epsilon-4 (APOE4) carrier status, and will gather critical new experimental evidence on the
      use of physical activity to improve cognitive performance by persons at the greatest risk of
      Alzheimer's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators follow up on their past research exploring the effects of
      physical activity on cognitive performance and underlying mechanisms. In particular, the
      investigators are interested in the potentially different effects that might be realized as a
      function of a person's genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the investigators
      extend past work by proposing a randomized clinical trial to: (a) test the causal link
      between physical activity and cognitive performance in middle-aged adults (40-65 years) with
      a family history, and (b) determine if the effect is moderated by apolipoprotein epsilon-4
      (APOE4) carrier status. The investigators will collect neuroimaging measures of cerebral
      structure, white matter integrity, and resting state connectivity; assess putative biological
      markers; and (using moderated mediation analyses) increase understanding of underlying
      mechanisms and of the extent to which effects are moderated by APOE4 carrier status. To test
      hypotheses, the investigators will randomly assign 240 cognitively normal, middle-aged adults
      (recruited in 4 cohorts of 60) to a 1-year physical activity program or a usual care control.
      Those in the physical activity program will exercise 3 times/week for one hour at a local
      Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). Those in the usual care control condition will be
      asked to maintain their normal lifestyle for one year and then will be given a short-term
      YMCA membership (contingent upon completion of testing sessions). The investigators will
      assess cognitive performance at pre-, mid-, and post-test, and obtain MRI scans and blood
      samples at pre- and post-test. The investigators will examine the effects of physical
      activity on cognitive performance and on neurological and biological mechanisms and will
      explore the moderating role of APOE4.

    <description>Subjects will attend group exercise sessions 3x/week for 1 year. Each subject will be encouraged to walk at a moderate intensity (target heart rate (HR)= 40-59% HR reserve) dependent on resting HR and age. At every session, exercise specialists will record the amount of time spent in the aerobic and strength training portions of the program and HR (assessed by palpation for 20-seconds) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) from each participant during the middle portion of aerobic activity and RPE during the middle portion of strength training. Data from exercise logs and exercise specialist records will be reviewed for evidence of progression, consistent attainment of moderate intensity, and with respect to the prescribed duration of the aerobic and strength training components.</description>

The proposal should include institutional affiliation, a current resume or vita, source of funding (if applicable), and a detailed explanation of the research question and the data required. All applicants will also be required to sign an agreement of confidentiality. This agreement prohibits the use of the data in any way that would allow for the identification of individual participants.</ipd_access_criteria>
