  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, progressive, and demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system that affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide and is more common in
      young adults. The most common clinical signs and symptoms include fatigue, spasticity,
      cognitive impairment, chronic pain, depression, decreased quality of life, and bladder and
      bowel dysfunction.

      Sleep disturbance is affecting more than 50% of persons with multiple sclerosis. Restless
      legs syndrome is one of the factors causing sleep disturbance in persons with multiple
      sclerosis. Studies have showed that the incidence of restless legs syndrome in persons with
      multiple sclerosis is about five times more than the general population.

      In order to increase and maintain the quality of life of persons with multiple sclerosis, the
      disease-related progressive symptoms need to be managed. Therefore, persons with multiple
      sclerosis need long-term rehabilitation. This situation reduces the motivation of the people
      over time and makes the continuity of treatment difficult. Developments in rehabilitation
      technology aim to contribute to the treatment process as well as to increase the active
      participation of individuals with chronic diseases.

      Current literature has shown that video-based physical activity training as
      non-pharmacological therapy may be an effective method for symptoms such as balance, walking,
      fatigue, cognitive functions in persons with multiple sclerosis, but the effects on restless
      legs syndrome are not known.

      The main aim of the study is to investigate the effects of 8-week video game-based physical
      activity training in persons with multiple sclerosis with restless legs syndrome.

      Persons who followed by the outpatient Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Dokuz Eyl√ºl University
      Hospital will participate in the study. A total of 68 participants will randomly be divided
      into 4 groups as exergaming group and control group with restless legs syndrome, exergaming
      group and control group without restless legs syndrome.

      A video game-based physical activity training will apply to exergaming groups by a
      physiotherapist for 2 days/week. The control groups will continue their routine treatment
      during the study. After the study, the treatment options will be offered to the participants.
      Assessments will done at baseline, after 8 weeks (post-treatment) and at 8 weeks (follow-up).
      Assessments will be done by assessors who are blinded to the group allocation.

    <measure>International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale for restless legs syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale for restless legs syndrome is used to assess severity of the restless legs syndrome symptoms. It consists of 10 items scored by 0 to 4. Possible scores range from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed 25-Foot Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. he patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. The score is the average of the two completed trials. Higher time represents slower walking speed and more walking impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>12-Item Multiple sclerosis walking scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-Item Multiple sclerosis walking scale is a self-assessment scale which measures the impact of multiple sclerosis on walking. It consists of 12 questions with Likert-type choose options concerning the limitations to walking due to multiple sclerosis during the past 2 weeks. Total score ranges 0 from 100. Higher scores indicate more impact of multiple sclerosis on walking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue in terms of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. The scale consists of 21 items with a Likert-type choose options. The total score for the scale is the sum of the scores for the 21 items. Individual subscale scores for physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning can also be generated by calculating the sum of specific sets of items. The total score ranges from 0 to 84. Higher score indicates higher level of fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. During the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has sit down. Higher time represents more static and dynamic balance and mobility impairment.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life, or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire is a commonly used questionnaire to measure of usual physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis. It contains three items that measure the frequency of strenuous, moderate, and mild physical activities for periods of more than 15 minutes during one's free time within a typical week. Weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate and mild physical activity were multiplied by 9, 5 and 3 metabolic equivalents, respectively, and were summed to form a measure of the total leisure physical activity. Higher scores indicate higher level of physical activity.</description>

Sub-sections evaluate motor (7 items), brainstem (4 items), sensory (4 items), neuropsychiatric problems (3 items) and excretory problems (6 items). Independent items are related with fatigue and sleep difficulty. Responses are in the form of a 6-point Likert scale (None: 0, almost no: 1, sometimes: 2, usually: 3, almost always: 4, always: 5).

    <measure>Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic Criteria for Restless Legs Syndrome was developed by the Restless Legs Syndrome Working Group in 1995 and revised in 2003 and 2014. These criteria include; the need to move the legs due to uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs, the need for movement or disturbing sensations start or worsen at rest, the need for movement or disturbing sensations can be partially or totally relieved by movements such as walking or stretching, the need for movement or disturbing sensations may worsen at night or only occur in the evening or night, The aforementioned features cannot be considered only in relation to primary symptoms or other medical or behavioral conditions (e.g., myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, leg cramps, habitual foot swing). Patients meeting all of the criteria are diagnosed with restless legs syndrome. The restless legs syndrome diagnosis will be confirmed by a neurologist.</description>
