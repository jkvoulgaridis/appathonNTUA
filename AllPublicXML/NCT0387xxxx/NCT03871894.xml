      Part I- Observational study In the first part , investigator would investigate and compare
      the energy requirements and substrate utilization in healthy subjects and in patients with
      liver cirrhosis of various etiologies across the disease severity state viz compensated,
      stable decompensated, critically ill cirrhotics. The investigator would also enroll patients
      with chronic kidney disease, critically ill patients of acute liver failure or acute on
      chronic liver failure as disease controls.

      Part II- Randomized Controlled Study All the eligible, critically ill cirrhotic patients on
      mechanical ventilator support would be randomized to a control group (receiving the
      nutritional therapy as per the standard enteral nutritional practice in a critical care
      setting) or the intervention group (receiving enteral nutrition based on proposed measured
      requirements by Indirect calorimetry (IC) given till the patient is in ICU(Intensive care
      unit). The IC would be done thrice a week in both groups.
