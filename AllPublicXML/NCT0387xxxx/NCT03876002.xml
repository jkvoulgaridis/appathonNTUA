      The overall goal of this protocol is to evaluate microglial activation in the brain using
      [18F]PBR06 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The specific objectives are:

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]PBR06 (Peripheral benzodiazepine
           receptor-06) in brain using positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with ALS and
           healthy volunteers (HV).

        -  To evaluate test/retest reliability of the tracer binding parameters in patients with
           ALS and HV.

        -  To evaluate the correlation of [18F]PBR06 binding with ALS disease clinical severity
           (ALSFRS-R, upper motor neuron burden (UMNB) and Ashworth Score), clinical disease
           sub-categorization, and other clinical data.

        -  To perform kinetic modeling using plasma-based (metabolite corrected plasma
           concentration) or reference region based methods or simplified quantification methods to
           assess the ability of [18F]PBR06 PET to measure microglial activation in brain.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]PBR06.

    <description>Time-activity data will be analyzed with 2-tissue compartment model, using the radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. To correct the brain data for its vascular component, radioactivity in serial whole blood will be measured and then subtracted from the PET measurements.
