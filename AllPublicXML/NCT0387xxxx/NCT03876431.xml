  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is performed in patients with advanced stages of osteoarthritis who
      can not respond to conservative treatment, in order to reduce pain, increase range of motion,
      and improve function and quality of life. Continuous passive motion device continues to be
      used in many clinics, although it has been shown that there is no effect in total knee
      arthroplasty rehabilitation. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical effects of the
      knee exercise device on pain, ROM and function and quality of life in total knee arthroplasty
      rehabilitation.

      Volunteers with total knee arthroplasty according to the criteria of inclusion, who will be
      operated in Istanbul University Istanbul Medical Faculty Orthopedics and Traumatology
      Department will be included this study. Participants will be randomly allocated 2 groups:
      easy-flex group and traditional exercise group. Exercise group will be treated with the
      traditional exercise program and the Easy-Flex group will be treated with the Easy-Flex
      device in addition to the traditional exercise program.
