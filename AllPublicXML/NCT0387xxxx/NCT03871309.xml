  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A registry study to collect data on the Tigertriever device at restoring blood flow by
      removing clots in M2 or distal vessels in patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke, during
      commercial use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tigertriever is a CE marked mechanical revascularization device indicated to restore blood
      flow by removing thrombus from a large intracranial vessel in patients experiencing ischemic
      stroke within 8 hours of symptom onset.

        Male or female patients (age ≥18) who present with an acute ischemic stroke due to a M2 or
        distal (medium to small) vessel occlusion confirmed by vessel imaging and treated with the
        Tigertriever 17 or 13 revascularization devices.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who present with acute ischemic stroke, who can be treated within 6 hours of
             symptoms onset, who are either refractory to or ineligible for IV t-PA treatment and
             intend to be treated with thrombectomy.

          -  Patients ≥18

          -  NIHSS Score of ≥2

          -  Angiographically confirmed occlusion in a M2 or distal (medium to small) branch that
             is accessible to the Tigertriever device (17 or 13) as determined by the vessel
             diameter (≥1mm).

          -  Anticipated life expectancy of at least 6 months from presentation

          -  Signed informed consent form by the patient or a legally acceptable representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Extended infarct - ischemic changes &gt;1/3 MCA territory / 100 ml tissue or ASPECT score
             &lt;5

               -  Pre- stroke mRS ≥ 2

               -  Unknown time of stroke symptom onset

               -  Vessel diameter &lt; 1mm

               -  Angiographically evident extreme vessel tortuosity that may preclude the device
                  from reaching the target area.

               -  Occlusion/stenosis proximal to thrombus that precludes safe retrieval

               -  Medical co-morbidities including but not limited to:

               -  Uncontrolled coagulopathy such as International Normalized Ratio (INR) of &gt; 3.0
                  or platelets count &lt; 40 x109/L or APTT &gt;50 sec

               -  Serious concurrent medical illness: myocardial infarction, seizures, sepsis,
                  uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, brain tumor, renal impairment
                  (eGFR &lt;60).

               -  Baseline glucose &lt; 2.7 or &gt; 22.2 mmol/L

               -  Imaging features of:

                    -  raised intracranial pressure or significant mass effect (for example,
                       midline shift, severe sulcal effacement, transcompartmental herniation)

                    -  intracranial hemorrhage

                    -  vascular malformation or aneurysm

                    -  significant vascular abnormality such as carotid dissection, complete
                       carotid occlusion or large/medium vessel vasculitis

               -  Allergy/sensitivity to nickel-titanium or contrast media

               -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

               -  Unable to obtain informed consent from the patient or a suitable legal
                  representative

               -  Any other contraindication to thrombectomy
