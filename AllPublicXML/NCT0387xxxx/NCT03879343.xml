      This study is to examine the gut problems in children with attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorders (ADHD) and is conducted by the Department of Psychiatry of Alice Ho Miu Ling
      Nethersole Hospital. Children with ADHD who attend our department will be recruited with
      their parents/guardians' consent. Only the primary caregiver will be invited for an interview
      to assess the recruited children's gut problems, autistic features, emotional problems, diet
      pattern and medical history. The data will be compared with normal children who are recruited
      as control in local primary schools. The aim of this study is to know whether children with
      ADHD have higher chance of gut problems, and to assess other factors associated with the
      linkage.
