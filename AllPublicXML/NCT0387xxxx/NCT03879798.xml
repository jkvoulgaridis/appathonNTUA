             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last
             dose of DS-3201b or irinotecan, whichever date is later.

               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             medications. Patients who are able to discontinue any prohibited medication prior to
             the start of study drug at Day -7 will still be considered eligible for the study.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of or known hypersensitivity to

             test and a positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test at screening, are
             eligible for the study.

          -  Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, defined as having a positive HCV antibody
             test followed by a positive HCV RNA test at screening.
