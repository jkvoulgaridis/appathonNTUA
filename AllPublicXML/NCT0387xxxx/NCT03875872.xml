  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol used as anaesthesia in surgery had shown small postoperative analgesic benefits over
      inhalational anaesthetics in some meta-analyses. It was also associated with reduced risk of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. Small sample of studies together with high heterogeneity
      prevented some meta-analyses to confirm propofol's effect for postoperative morphine
      consumption and other outcomes. Acute Pain Service data bank can provide an alternative way
      of evaluating postoperative outcomes of propofol anaesthetics through supplying a very large
      sample size in a more homogeneous setting. Retrospective study comparing propofol and
      inhalational anaesthetics on postoperative pain matched on patients' demographic and clinical
      data had been done for liver surgery. Propofol's benefits for postoperative pain and morphine
      consumption was confirmed but not for adverse effects.

      This study plans to analyze the postoperative outcome data from an Acute Pain Service data
      bank in years 2015-17 to compare the anaesthetics of propofol and inhalational anaesthetics.
      Comprehensive regression adjustment for confounders are performed using all available
      patients' demographic, clinical and anaesthetic data. All major surgery types are included.
      Results will provide postoperative outcome differences between propofol and inhalational
      anaesthetics for all surgeries and for specific type of surgeries. The large sample bank will
      provide higher probability for detecting outcome difference between the anaesthetics for all
      the major surgical types.

      Objective: To compare the postoperative outcomes between surgeries anaesthetized with
      propofol and inhalational anaesthetics in the Acute Pain Service records of Queen Mary
      Hospital for years 2015-17

      Methods:

      Retrospective

      Data collection

        1. Demographic data;

        2. Type of surgery;

        3. Type of anaesthetic techniques;

        4. Postoperative NRS pain scores (Rest and Moving) for Postop Days 1, 2 &amp; 3;

        5. Accumulated amount of patient controlled analgesia (PCA) used in Postop Days 1, 2 &amp; 3;

        6. Postoperative incidence of nausea, vomitting, dizziness and pruritus.
