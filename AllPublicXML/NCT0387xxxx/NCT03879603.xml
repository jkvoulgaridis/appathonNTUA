  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Western Equine Encephalitis Virus (WEEV), Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV), and
      Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes
      and can cause encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and other neurological manifestations,
      including fever, chills, discomfort, feeling sick, muscle pain and then headache, vomiting,
      restlessness, irritability, seizures, coma, and death.

      Vaccines teach the body to prevent or fight an infection. When the body learns to fight an
      infection, this is called an immune response. Researchers developed a vaccine against
      Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses to help the body make an immune
      response. There are no live or killed viruses in the vaccine, so you cannot get infected with
      any of these 3 viruses from getting the vaccine.

      The experimental trivalent encephalitis vaccine, VRC-WEVVLP073-00-VP, is composed of Western
      equine encephalitis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and Venezuelan equine
      encephalitis (VEE) virus-like particles (VLP).

      The purpose of this study is to test three doses (6 mcg, 30 mcg, and 60 mcg) of this
      experimental vaccine against Western, Eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study to examine the safety,
      tolerability, and immune response of three doses (6 mcg, 30 mcg, and 60 mcg) of the WEVEE
      vaccine (VRC-WEVVLP073-00-VP) alone or with alum adjuvant (VRC-GENMIX083-AL-VP) in a
      2-product administration regimen.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to WEVEE alone (Groups 1, 3, and 5) or WEVEE plus alum
      (Groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively) in each dose group. No more than 1 subject will be
      randomized and vaccinated per day for the first 3 subjects at each dose. If the 6 mcg dose of
      WEVEE is assessed as not showing safety concerns by a Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT),
      randomization will begin for Groups 3 and 4 (30 mcg WEVEE without alum and with alum,
      respectively). A second safety review will be conducted on the first 3 subjects to receive 30
      mcg and if the 30 mcg dose of WEVEE is assessed as not showing safety concerns by the PSRT,
      randomization will begin for Groups 5 and 6 (60 mcg WEVEE without and with alum,
      respectively).

      The product will be administered in the upper arm muscle as an intramuscular (IM) injection
      via needle and syringe at Day 0 and 8 weeks later.

      For all Groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card.
      Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of
      hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.

WEVEE vaccine alone (Group 1, Group 3, and Group 5) or, WEVEE vaccine mixed with alum (Group 2, Group 4, and Group 6, respectively).
The study will start by randomizing subjects to get a dose of 6 mcg in Group 1 or Group 2. Safety data will be reviewed after 2 weeks to make sure this vaccine dose has no safety concerns before subjects are randomized to get the next dose of 30 mcg in Group 3 or Group 4. Safety data will again be reviewed to make sure this vaccine dose has no safety concerns before subjects are randomized to the 60 mcg dose in Group 5 or Group 6.
A total of 30 participants are expected to be randomized among the 6 groups.</intervention_model_description>
