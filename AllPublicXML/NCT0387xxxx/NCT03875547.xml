  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants are invited to take part in this study because they have Haemophilia B. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of Refixia® about long-term
      routine use in patients with Haemophilia B. The participants will get Refixia® as prescribed
      to them by their study doctor. The study will last up to Sep 2025 for the participant. The
      participants may be asked to fill in the quality of life questionnaires (if they are above
      age of 15). The blood samples taken from the participants as part of routine clinical
      practice will also be used to investigate the safety for the long-term use of Refixia®.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed consent obtained before any study-related activities (study-related activities
             are any procedure related to recording of data according to the protocol).

          -  The decision to initiate treatment with commercially available Refixia® has been made
             by the patient/Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR) and the treating physician
             before and independently from the decision to include the patient in this study. At
             each site of this study, all patients will be registered consecutively from the first
             patient after the launch of Refixia® (consecutively registered system).

          -  Diagnosis of haemophilia B in males or females, no age limitation. Patients younger
             than 12 years old will continue to be registered for 3 years of recruitment period
             regardless of the target number of patients.

          -  New patients who have not been previously exposed to Refixia®. Also patients
             previously exposed to Refixia® in NN7999-3639, -3747, -3774, -3775 or -3895 clinical
             trial can be enrolled in this study. The patients who have participated in NN7999
             -3774 or -3895 clinical trial can be enrolled in this study as continuous cases until
             30-September-2024 (one year before planned end of study date).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this study. Participation is defined as having given
             informed consent in this study

          -  Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation
