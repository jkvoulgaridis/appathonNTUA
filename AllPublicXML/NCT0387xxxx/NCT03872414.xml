  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research applies the highly innovative technology of real-time functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtfMRI) to examine plasticity of brain-regulatory mechanisms
      related to cognitive and affective processing and to determine benefits for cognition and
      affect in young and older adults and in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that age-related alterations in brain function associated with
      affective processing and attention contribute to these motivational and emotional changes
      with age.

      Based on these theoretical considerations as well as the previous study's data, the proposed
      research will apply well-tested emotion processing and attention paradigms to address the
      pivotal question of whether brain activity can be modulated in healthy aging and PD (in the
      substudy) via contingent rt-fMRI neurofeedback and whether this neuroregulatory modulation
      increases emotion processing and cognitive performance.

The anterior cingulate cortex is a brain region that is known to be involved in emotion processing. Activation of this region is expected to improve emotion processing.</description>

    <description>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Participants in each group will be trained using functional magnetic resonance imaging to regulation brain activity in primary auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex is a brain region that is NOT specifically involved in emotion processing. Activation of this region is NOT expected to improve emotion processing; and thus activation of this brain region serves as &quot;control/placebo&quot; condition in the current design (placebo comparator).</description>
