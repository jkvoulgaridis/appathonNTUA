    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of psychotherapy as treatment for PTSD, and specifically
      how brain activity and brain connectivity is affected by Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy
      (MBCT) and an active mind-body comparison comparison therapy.

      This research will see how brain activity and brain connectivity is affected by Mindfulness
      Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and an active comparison therapy called Muscle Relaxation
      Therapy (MRT). Participants that qualify to be in this study will be randomly assigned to
      receive 8 weeks of group therapy in either MBCT or MRT treatments. Prior to receiving therapy
      participants will: complete baseline assessments related to their PTSD; fill out surveys;
      have an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); and provide saliva samples. These
      assessments will be repeated after the therapy is over. Overall study participation should
      last approximately 10-12 weeks.

    <measure>Group differences in the change in resting-state functional connectivity between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-therapy and post therapy (approximately 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Network functional connectivity will be measured through fMRI blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] signal. Time-course of BOLD signal while participants are &quot;resting&quot; / not performing a task will be used identify brain regions whose activity time-course is correlated with a brain region of interest (ROI), called a &quot;seed&quot; ROI. We will use activity in the PCC as a seed ROI and search for regions of time-course correlation within the dlPFC, searching for dlPFC clusters within an anatomical mask of middle frontal cortex. Betas for identified dlPFC clusters will be extracted.</description>

    <ipd_description>We plan to make available data from fMRI scans from human subjects initially to collaborators for independent replication / data pooling. We also plan to make the de-identified brain scans available to the broad scientific community, however, additional redaction steps may need to be made to brain scans to ensure subject confidentiality / inability to identify individuals from brain scans. Completely de-identified research data (redacted according to NIH practice to prevent disclosure of personal identifiers) which documents the research findings will be made available after the main findings from the finalized research dataset have been accepted for publication.</ipd_description>
