  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a fairly common condition resulting in hyperpigmented macules on the face. Melasma
      is difficult to treat and has a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.

      Melasma is worsen when exposed to high energy visible light (blue and violet light) of the
      solar spectrum. Blue light emitted by LED screens from computers, tablets, televisions and
      even mobile phones is currently suspected (via media channels) to induce harmful effects on
      the skin, including pigmentation and photoaging. These screens, however, emit much lower
      irradiances than those of the solar spectrum, and the probability that these irradiances
      impact the skin is very low.

      The objective of the study is to assess the effect of blue light emitted by
      computer/television screens on the intensity of melasma pigmentation. To do this, it is
      proposed to use maximized conditions that could be encountered in normal daily life, namely a
      simulation of blue light exposure (420-490nm) at 20 cm from a laptop LED screen, 8 hours a
      day for 5 days. Since it is not proposed to expose a person for 8 hours a day, a solar
      simulator with appropriate filters will be used to emit a spectrum of between 420 and 490 nm
      with a compatible intensity for an acceptable duration of exposure (around 30 minutes a day).

      Twelve patients will be included in the study and exposed on a half-face from Day1 to Day5.
      The other half-face will serve as unexposed control. The effect of blue light on the melasma
      lesions will be assessed from Day 1 to Day 6 using chromametry and a modified MASI on
      standardized photographs. A final evaluation visit will be performed at Day 15.
