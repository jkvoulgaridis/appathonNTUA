    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide information about human subcutaneous fat thickness at
      different anatomic sites on the body by measuring these thicknesses with a diagnostic
      ultrasound and also by correlating patient perceptions of body image with measured fat
      distribution.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.
