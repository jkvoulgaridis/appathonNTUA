      To assess the efficacy and safety of Abatacept as an immunosuppressive treatment in Birdshot
      uveitis. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy to suppress active uveitis in
      Birdshot uveitis and to induce inflammatory remission during the 1 year treatment. Treatment
      efficacy will be assessed, using quantitative and qualitative measurements of visual
      function. In this trial we will also assess the utility of quantitative outcome measures in
      detecting disease activity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>time to recurrence in ≥1 eye</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are assessed for recurrence, if at least 1 of the following criteria are fulfilled in at least 1 eye.
worsening of BCVA (Best Corrected Visual Acuity measured by ETDRS chart) by &gt;15 letters relative to baseline
30% increase of central retinal thickness on OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) relative to baseline
2-step increase in VH (Vitreous Haze) grade relative to baseline
new active, inflammatory choroidal (detected on ICG Angiography) and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions relative to baseline (detected on FA: fluorescein angiography).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vitreous Haze (VH) Grade in Each Eye From Baseline to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous haze is measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI) and SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized; Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades); Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades); Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry; Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change In Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) In Each Eye From Baseline to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using corrective lenses based on that visit's refraction testing, participant's best corrected visual acuity is measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Evidence of Macular Edema in At Least 1 Eye On or After Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Optical coherence tomography is performed at every visit using the Zeiss Cirrus OCT. Images are evaluated by a central reader (PI). Macular edema is defined as cystoid macular edema. OCT evidence of macular edema on or after Baseline is to be counted as an event. Dropouts due to reasons other than OCT evidence of macular edema are to be considered as censored observations at the time of dropping out.
Optical Coherence Tomography will be measured using the Zeiss Cirrus OCT. For each eye a macular cube slab 512x128 and 2 HD 5 lines rasters (1 on 180° and 1 on 90°) will be taken, centered on the fovea.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Choroidal Thickness in Each Eye From Best State Achieved Prior to week 6 to the Final/Early Termination Visit</measure>

    <description>Participants will inject the drug at home on a weekly basis. Participants will receive the syringes on the visit dates, supplying them for the period until the next visit. At baseline, participants will be explained and shown how to inject the drug themselves.
Subject will have to stop all concomitant immunosuppressive drugs at baseline, e.g. Corticosteroids, Methotrexate, Mofetil Mycophenolate, Azathioprine, Tacrolimus, Sirolimus or Cyclosporin. Other drugs can be continued. In case of recurrence in the abatacept group, the study will end for that subject.
Patients treated with abatacept (ORENCIA) may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with abatacept or within 3 months of its discontinuation.</description>

          2. Subject is diagnosed with Birdshot uveitis, HLA A 29+

          3. Subject must have active disease at the Baseline visit as defined by the presence of
             at least 1 of the following parameters in at least one eye :

             -Active, inflammatory, chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions

             -≥ 1+ vitreous haze (National Eye Institute [NEI]/SUN criteria)

          4. Subjects who do not have previous, active or latent tuberculosis (TB). Subjects with
             negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)

             test (or IGRA equivalent) result are not eligible. The TB screening tests are

             interpreted in the context of the patient's epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc.
             and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a patient has
             previous, active or latent tuberculosis or not. Under no circumstances can a patient
             with a positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) enter the study.
