      A prospective, multi-center, multi-national single arm study conducted in Austria, France,
      and Germany to evaluate the performance and safety of HEMOBLAST™ Bellows in laparoscopic
      abdominal, gynecological, and urological surgery. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up
      to 10 sites, with a minimum of 8 subjects enrolled in each surgical specialty.
