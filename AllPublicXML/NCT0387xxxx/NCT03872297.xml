  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fish collagen hydrolysates or peptides orally administered have been investigated in recent
      clinical trials in human health. These peptides have been evaluated in various biological and
      medical fields including skin aging, osteoarticular apparatus, muscle and more recently in
      energy metabolism in both animals and humans.

      However, very few studies investigated the effect of fish collagen peptides on weight, body
      composition or glycemic response. Recently, it has been shown that the consumption of fish
      collagen peptides (Naticol®) limits weight gain and increase in fat mass in a mouse model
      made obese by a hyperlipidic diet. Since these results have never been observed in humans,
      this pilot study proposes to answer this question.
