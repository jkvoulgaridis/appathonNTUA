  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is complex and
      multifactorial. Chronotropic incompetence has emerged as a crucial mechanism, particularly in
      elderly patients. Betablockers, drugs with negative chronotropic effect, are commonly used in
      HFpEF, despite current evidence does not support its routine use in these patients. The aim
      of this work is to evaluate the effect of betablockers withdrawal in patients with HFpEF and
      chronotropic incompetence on functional capacity assessed by the peak oxygen consumption at
      maximal exercise (peakVO2) at 15 and 30 days after the intervention
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, crossover, randomized (1:1) and single center study. After
      randomization, clinical and cardiac rhythm will be continuously registered during 30 days.
      The primary endpoint (peakVO2) will be assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at
      15 and 30-day in both groups. Patients with HFpEF, functional class NYHA II-III, chronic
      treatment with betablockers, and chronotropic incompetence will be enrolled. A sample size
      estimation [alfa: 0.05, power: 90%, a 15% loss rate, and delta change of mean peakVO2: +1.2
      mL/kg/min (SD±2.5)] of 52 patients would be necessary to test our hypothesis.

      In conclusion, optimizing therapy that improve quality of life and autonomy has become a
      health care priority in HFpEF. The investigators believe this study will add important
      knowledge for the treatment of a subgroup of HFpEF.
