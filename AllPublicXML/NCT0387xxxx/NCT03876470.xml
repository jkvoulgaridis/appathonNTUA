  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to conduct a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative
      assessment of the impact of our innovative collaborative telehealth HCV care model on patient
      treatment experiences and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the proportion of patients at each step of the HCV care
      cascade before and after implementation of the collaborative care model. Additionally,
      participants will complete questionnaires at three time points: at the initiation of
      hepatitis C treatment, at treatment completion, and at the assessment of sustained virologic
      response. Questionnaires will assess quality of life, mental health, chronic liver disease
      outcomes, and substance use. A subset of participants will also complete semi-structured
      interviews at each of the three time points. Then, a smaller subset of participants will be
      selected for a detailed ethnographic case study focusing on treatment experiences, quality of
      life, forms of social support, and illness experience.
