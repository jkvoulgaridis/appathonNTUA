          -  Any other clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results at screening
             that would, in the opinion of the investigator, increase the participant's risk of

             participants with a positive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may be enrolled at the
             discretion of the investigator if the participants' THC use is under 4 times/month and

             participation.
