  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum urinary retention is an uncommon complication of the vaginal delivery. Failure to
      diagnose it may have a real impact both on the urinary plane but also on the psychological
      level.

      The hypothesis is that the identification of risk factors for the emergence of acute urinary
      retention would allow preventive management. The investigator conducted a retrospective,
      comparative, case-control study, including 2 groups of 96 patients who have had a vaginal
      delivery in the department between 2011 and 2015. The first group included patients with
      postpartum acute urinary retention (PAUR). The second group, control group, without PAUR, was
      selected randomly, respecting a 1:1 matching criteria, including the year of delivery and the
      age of the patient at delivery. The goal was to identify the potential risk factors of
      post-partum acute urinary retention in order to define a better prevention.
