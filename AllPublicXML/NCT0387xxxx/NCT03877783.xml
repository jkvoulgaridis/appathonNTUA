  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the DEMAND pilot study, we will recruit and randomize 80 participants at two study sites
      (Umeå and Uppsala) for a one-year intervention. The primary objectives are to study the
      inclusion rate, the adherence rate, and the acceptability of the intervention. The secondary
      objectives are to examine the effect of the intervention on intermediate outcomes, including
      metabolic control (i.e., blood glucose and lipids), body weight, blood pressure, physical
      fitness, and cognitive function. Third, the investigators will perform focus group interviews
      to explore the participants views on the intervention to assess the acceptability. The
      interventions include (a) Mediterranean diet (b) an individualized physical training program
      and (c) pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) aimed to achieve individualized
      optimal goals, according to national guidelines, taking into account the risk of
      hypoglycaemia. This multi-component intervention is more comprehensive than usual care, and
      it specifically focuses on vascular domains.

    <description>The recommended Mediterranean diet is based on lean meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, berries, and nuts. Extra-virgin olive oil is the recommended additional fat source for use in food preparation and dressings. Recommended exclusions or restrictions include dairy products, cereals, added salt, refined fats, and sugar. Participants in the intervention group will receive weekly deliveries of olive oil and mixed nuts, free of cost, and they will receive recipes for Mediterranean meals on a regular basis. During the study, the intervention group will receive written, personalized advice from a project dietician on how to improve their Mediterranean diets. This written personalized advice will be based on the reported food intake, its coherence with a Mediterranean diet, and its adherence to the recommended intakes of energy and nutrients for each participant.</description>

    <intervention_name>individualized fitness program</intervention_name>
    <description>The exercise intervention will consist of individualized training programs designed to improve cardiovascular fitness (VO2). A personal trainer will distribute the training program instructions and monitor the training during the entire intervention. Support will be provided via text messages. The training intensity will be based on results from an extensive pre-test of individual physical fitness performance, and we will adjust the intensity over the study period, as fitness improves. The goal is to engage participants in training three times per week, for up to one hour per training session. The individualized training programs will consist of brisk walks, jogging, and cycling, tailored to each participant. To ensure that the training intensity is sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness, heart rate will be monitored during each session.</description>

    <description>Hyperglycemia: first metformin till target level of HbA1c 1) 53-58 mmol/mol for patients with ≤2 coexisting chronic illnesses or 2) 59-64 mmol/mol for those with established cardiovascular disease (CVD). We will recommend a second glucose-lowering drug when HbA1c is not achieved and which reduce CVD even when the participant does not have a manifest CVD.
Hypertension: will be treated to achieve a target level according to European guidelines. Start with a combination of a renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blocker and a thiazide in low dose or a combination of a RAS-blocker a calcium channel blocker in low dose. If the target is not reached within 12 weeks additional drugs should be added.
Dyslipidemia: Patients with a CVD risk of 2-8% within 5 years should receive treatment with atorvastatin 10mg +ezetimib 10mg; CVD risk 8-20%, atorvastatin 20mg + ezetimib 10mg and CVD risk &gt; 20% atorvastatin 40-80mg +ezetimib 10mg.</description>
