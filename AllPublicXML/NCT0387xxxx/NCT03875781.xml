  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-inferiority phase III randomised trial comparing preoperative
      chemotherapy alone (modified FOLFIRINOX) to chemoradiotherapy in patients with primary
      resectable locally advanced rectal cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is 3-year
      progression free survival.

      Expected 3 year PFS rate in the preoperative chemoradiotherapy arm is 70%. This hazard rate,
      in an exponential survival model, corresponds to a decrease in the 3-year PFS rate on the
      preoperative chemotherapy arm to 62%. The study will randomize 574 patients (287 in the
      chemotherapy group and 287 in the chemoradiotherapy group) in 42 french academic centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a national, multicenter, open-label randomized, 2-arm phase III non-inferiority
      trial.

      Patients with mid or low LARC (cT3N0 or cT1-T3N+ with CRM &gt; 2 mm on pretreatment MRI) will be
      randomized to two arms of treatment: one experimental arm with systemic FOLFIRINOX
      chemotherapy for 3 months and one control arm with conventional standardized
      radiochemotherapy (intensified-modulated radiotherapy 50Gy + capecitabine). The choice of
      FOLFIRINOX for preoperative chemotherapy is based on recent data regarding its safety and
      efficacy rectal cancer with or without metastatic disease. All patients will have
      reassessment MRI after preoperative treatment and before surgery.

      Objectives and study endpoints

      - primary endpoint : 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) from the time to randomization.
      In this trial, a modified definition of PFS will be used for the primary endpoint. The
      rationale for using this modified definition of PFS is to better assess time to failure of
      the whole treatment strategy (preoperative treatment and surgery).

      Progression will be assessed as follows:

        -  progression during preoperative treatment and before surgery: circumferential resection
           margin ≤ 2mm at MRI reeassessemnt and diagnosis of any new distant lesion whatever the
           site (liver, lung, peritoneum, adrenal) are considered as progression events.

        -  progression after surgery: recurrence/progression after surgery or death, whatever comes
           first.

             -  Secondary endpoints: treatment related toxicity, treatment compliance, R0 resection
                rate, sphincter saving surgery rate, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates,
                loco-regional recurrence free survival, overall survival, bowel and sexual
                functions at diagnosis, quality of life, radiologic and pathologic response after
                preoperative treatment.

      Statistical analysis A sample size of 551 patients, based on an expected accrual duration of
      36 months, 60 months minimum follow-up, and an expected 3 year PFS rate in the preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy arm of 70%, is expected to provide 295 PFS events required to provide 80%
      power to declare non-inferiority of the preoperative chemotherapy arm when the true hazard
      ratio between arms is 1.0 (H1). This design has a type one-error rate of 0.05 if the true
      hazard ratio between arms is 1.34 (H0). This hazard rate, in an exponential survival model,
      corresponds to a decrease in the 3-year PFS rate on the preoperative chemotherapy arm to 62%.
      Two interim analyses for efficacy and futility for the primary end point are planned. By
      considering a rate of 4% for not informative or lost to follow-up patients the total number
      of patients to be included in this trial was 551*100/96=574 patients.

      Ancillary studies Pronostic value of circulating cancer cells before and after preoperative
      treatment and after surgery in patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer after
      chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy will be evaluated. After assessment of prognostic value of
      each rate on survival, recurrence and response to treatment, evaluation of prognostic impact
      of variation of the rate during differents phases of treatment will be carried out.
