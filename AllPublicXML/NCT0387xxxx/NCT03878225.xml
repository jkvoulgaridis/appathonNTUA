  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A ketogenic diet (KD) is high in fat and low in carbohydrates and induces ketosis. KD is an
      approved non-pharmacological therapy for drug-resistant child epilepsy. Research has shown
      that a KD can reduce the behavioral measures of alcohol withdrawal symptomatology in rats.
      Ketosis is also possible to achieve without adherence to a KD, by ingestion of a ketogenic
      dietary supplement. In this study, we want to investigate if the attenuating effect of the KD
      observed in rodents, is also applicable in humans, i.e. whether a ketogenic dietary
      supplement, here a ketone monoester, would be effective in suppressing alcohol withdrawal
      symptoms in humans.

      Objective:

      To test the effect of a ketogenic dietary supplement on the need for benzodiazepines in
      managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome in humans.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18-70 years who are alcohol dependent and are seeking treatment for alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome in an out-patient setting.

      Design:

      Double blinded, randomized clinical trial. The participants will be randomized to receive
      either the ketone ester beverage, or a placebo beverage.

      The study will be conducted over three days (72 hours), with follow-up at 1 month and 1 year
      after completion. A sub-set of patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
      following withdrawal treatment, and again after 1 month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroimaging studies have shown that acute alcohol administration decreases glucose
      metabolism in the human brain, which was initially thought to reflect decreased brain
      function. However, subsequent studies showed that even low doses of alcohol, with minimal
      behavioral effects, also decreased baseline brain glucose metabolism and further. This led to
      the hypothesis that the reduction in brain glucose metabolism during alcohol intoxication
      reflected the brain's utilization of an alternate energy substrate, e.g. the alcohol
      metabolite acetate. Acetate is not a ketone body, but biochemically similar to the ketone
      bodies, which include acetoacetate, BHB and acetone. Ketone bodies are similarly taken up by
      the Monocarboxylate Transporters in neurons, and other brain tissue. A pre-clinical trial has
      demonstrated that the implementation of a KD for 10 days significantly reduced the behavioral
      measures of alcohol withdrawal symptomatology in rats. In this study, we want to investigate
      if the attenuating effect of the KD observed in rodents, is also applicable in humans, i.e.
      whether a ketogenic dietary supplement, here a ketone monoester, would be effective in
      suppressing alcohol withdrawal symptoms in humans.

      Objectives:

      We will investigate the effect of a five times daily oral administration of a ketone dietary
      supplement beverage vs. placebo on the need for benzodiazepines in alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome. The KME beverage is a supplement to standardized out-patient alcohol withdrawal
      treatment.

      Study population:

      36 participants aged 18-70 with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-V,
      ICD-10, and a previous history of treatment-requiring alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

      Design:

      Clinical double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-day clinical trial, with an
      MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) sub-study. The participants will be randomized to
      receive either the ketone ester beverage, or a placebo beverage 5 times daily. Participants
      will be asked to register benzodiazepine use in a medication-diary during the study.
      Participants will be asked to self-monitor blood-glucose and ketone levels by use of
      fingerstick measurements. During the study patients will be evaluated for withdrawal
      severity, and complete questionnaires on alcohol craving, sleep, anxiety and mood.

    <masking_description>Randomization will be stratified according to gender and body-weight. The randomization uses stratified permuted block randomization. Selected un-blinded personnel will carry out the randomization procedure. After randomization is carried out, the ketone mono ester or placebo beverages will be delivered to the patients by blinded personnel. Patients, investigators, other caregivers and persons performing data analysis will remain blinded from the time of randomization until the time of database unlock. Un-blinded project personnel will prepare and pack the ketone mono ester/placebo beverage in identical bottles. The placebo beverage will consist of water added with a colorless, bitter flavor enhancer (Bitrex®) and a sweetening agent (Stevia) to approximate the taste of the ketone mono ester beverage as closely as possible.</masking_description>

Each question has a point giving system from 0-5 points. The higher the score, the more severe outcome. Scores from 20-24 indicates minor depressive symptoms. Scores from 25-29 indicates a moderate depression. Scores from 30 and above indicates major depressive symptoms.</description>
