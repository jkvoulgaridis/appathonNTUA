  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CRS remains a common challenging clinical entity due to variable phenotypes with different
      underlying mechanisms that lead to persistence or recurrence polyps. The eosinophils dominant
      inflammation was considered as a major pathological hallmark and challenges of CRS with nasal
      polyps (CRSwNP). Differentiate surgical approaches towards eosinophilic CRSwNP (eCRSwNP)
      should be addressed on the basis of the inflammatory endotypes. eCRSwNP has been recognized
      as the most easily relapsed type of CRS, and the combination of asthma increases the
      difficulty of treatment. Till now there is no recognized surgical strategy for eCRSwNP with
      asthma.

    <description>The procedure of RESS was completed as described in &quot;full-house FESS (FHF)&quot; approach, involving complete removal of all nasal polyps along with a full maxillary antrostomy, total ethmoidectomy, wide sphenoidotomy, and a Draf 2A frontal sinusotomy. Moreover the bilateral inferior two-thirds of MTs were meanwhile resected. The technique for the Draf 3 frontal drillout procedure was described in detail in previous publications with resection of the superior nasal septum, central frontal sinus floor, and frontal beak region, resulting in a widely patent, oval-shaped, common frontal sinus neo-ostium</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of CRSwNP was based on the standard criteria issued in the European
             Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps guidelines.

          -  Participants had at least 1 previous sinus surgery underwent FESS (middle turbinate
             (MT) preserved), good gasification of frontal sinus and with concomitant asthma.

          -  The diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by a chest physician according to Global
             Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines.

          -  Polyp biopsy was undertaken 1 week before surgery and the eCRSwNP was confirmed by the
             number of eosinophils exceeded 10% of total infiltrating inflammatory cells in the
             polyp tissue through the evaluation by using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining.
