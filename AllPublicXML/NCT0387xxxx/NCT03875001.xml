             methods are:

               -  A vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to screening (with medical assessment
                  of the surgical success) or

               -  Surgical sterilisation (including bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy) of the subject's female partner or

                  least 2 months prior to first drug administration, or barrier method (e.g.,
                  diaphragm with spermicide) Unprotected sexual intercourse with a pregnant female
                  partner is not allowed throughout the study and until three months after the last

             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
