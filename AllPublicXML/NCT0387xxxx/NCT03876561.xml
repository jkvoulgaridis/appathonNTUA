  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no specific treatment and only few measures to prevent the low anterior
      resection syndrome (LARS). The LARS often results in a severe alteration of quality of life.
      This study is designed to assess pelvic floor prehabilitation using biofeedback in the
      prevention of LARS following total mesorectal excision for cancer. The pelvic floor
      rehabilitation with biofeedback has already been tested postoperatively in patients suffering
      from LARS with heterogeneous results. However, this rehabilitation has never been evaluated
      in the prevention of LARS.

      The prehabilitation is an innovative concept currently evaluated in the prevention of
      functional complications following orthopedic surgery and also prostate surgery. In high-risk
      abdominal surgery, cardiopulmonary prehabilitation offers satisfying results in terms of
      morbidity and mortality rates. This study will be the first to assess pelvic floor
      prehabilitation in the prevention of LARS.
