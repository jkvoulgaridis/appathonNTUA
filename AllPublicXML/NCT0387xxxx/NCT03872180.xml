  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bendamustine, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax work in
      treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine
      and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack
      the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      bendamustine, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax may work better in treating patients with mantle
      cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of bendamustine, obinutuzumab and venetoclax
      in patients with untreated mantle cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and dose intensity of the combination of bendamustine, obinutuzumab
      and venetoclax in untreated mantle cell lymphoma.

      II. To explore methods of determining molecular remission for patients with untreated mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL).

      III. To evaluate long-term outcomes including progression-free and overall survival for
      patients with untreated MCL who receive the combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28 of course 1 and days 1-10 of subsequent
      courses, bendamustine intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2, and obinutuzumab IV on days 1, 8,
      and 15 of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 45-60 days.

             high-risk for tumor lysis syndrome or for rapid clinical deterioration due to
             symptomatic disease by the investigator, a short course of steroids designed to
             decrease tumor burden is permitted)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

             syndrome)

               -  NOTE: Patients with renal or hepatic impairment that is disease-related (ie,
                  hydronephrosis, hepatic involvement) in the opinion of the investigator but who
                  meet all other eligibility criteria may be considered for enrollment in
                  consultation with the investigational new drug (IND) sponsor, Dr. Jonathon Cohen.
                  Documentation of prior adequate renal/hepatic function and clear association with
                  the disease will be required

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of
             venetoclax or 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, whichever is longer

                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus)

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper
                  intrauterine devices

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6
                  months after the last dose of obinutuzumab. Men must refrain from donating sperm
                  during this same period

               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during
                  the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of
                  obinutuzumab to avoid exposing the embryo

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  more recently treated low risk prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, or ductal
                  carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who are felt to be at low risk for progression and who
                  are not currently taking any chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or other anti-cancer
                  therapy are eligible. Patients who have been treated and been in remission for &lt;
                  2 years must be cleared with the study chair prior to initiating study therapy

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results or that could increase risk
             to the patient, including renal disease that would preclude chemotherapy
