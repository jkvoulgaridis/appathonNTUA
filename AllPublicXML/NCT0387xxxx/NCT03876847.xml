  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of coronary ischemia and
      infarction where a tear in blood vessel wall either restricts the flow of blood or the blood
      becomes trapped in between the layers of the vessel causing the vessel to impinge on the
      lumen and causing an obstruction or restriction of blood flow. The ultimate goal of this
      proposal is to further understand the risk factors leading to SCAD with a focus on familial
      and genetic causes of SCAD.

      For this study, we will ascertain clinical data and biological samples from a cohort of SCAD
      patients identified using retrospective review of medical records and prospective
      surveillance of Intermountain patients that undergo coronary angiography. The SCAD diagnosis
      will be based on independent review of clinical presentation, cardiac imaging, and
      angiography findings by two cardiologists and a third cardiologist in case of disagreement.
      It is anticipated that we hope to recruit 100 SCAD patients.

      Enrollment of these subjects will be done under the INSPIRE registry. The subjects will be
      asked to sign a consent, provide biological samples, and complete questionnaires related to
      SCAD as part of the INSPIRE registry.

      The SCAD cases will be matched to records in the Intermountain Genealogy Registry (IGR) to
      allow for the identification of possible high-risk SCAD families. Risk of first and second
      degree relatives will also be assessed. The obtained blood samples will be processed, stored
      and genotyped.

    <description>To determine genetic variants among spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) patients, we will do genotyping including target sequencing and whole exome/genome sequencing on samples provided by SCAD patients. The primary focus of this sequencing will be to determine rates of variants in genes that cause cardiac-related connective tissue disorders.</description>

    <description>The spontaneous coronary artery disection (SCAD) diagnosis will be based on independent review of clinical presentation, cardiac imaging, and angiography findings by three cardiologists. The determination will be evidence of linear luminal defect (intimal flap) detection, luminal narrowing or occlusion confirmed to be a dissection on further imaging, or by clinical judgment classifying it as definite SCAD.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        SCAD Cases

          1. Subjects of all ages, gender, or race

          2. Subjects had coronary angiography.

          3. Subjects had suspected SCAD as based on clinical report.

        Controls

          1. INSPIRE subject that had coronary angiography at Intermountain Healthcare for stable
             angina.

          2. Subjects had no or mild atherosclerotic heart disease at time of angiography.

          3. Age at last visit as recorded in the Intermountain EDW at least 50 years or older.

          4. Not screened as possibly having a SCAD or coronary artery dissection diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        SCAD Cases

          1. Independent review of cardiac imaging and clinical presentation by three cardiologists
             determine the coronary angiography was not a result of SCAD.

          2. Imaging from time of coronary angiography of poor quality as to not allow for proper
             determination of SCAD.
