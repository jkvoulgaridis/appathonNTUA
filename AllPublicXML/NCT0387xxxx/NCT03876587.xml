      A multi-center, one-arm, open label design study,which is planned to enroll 79 patients with
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line treatment with pyrotinib and
      docetaxel. The main purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of
      first-line treatment with pyrrolidine and docetaxel for HER2-positive metastatic breast
      cancer.
