  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if multiple therapy sessions of Transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS non-invasive brain stimulation) combined with robotic arm therapy
      lead to a greater functional recovery in upper limb mobility after stroke than that provided
      by robotic arm therapy alone.

    <measure>Median Change in Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention), and follow-up at 36 weeks (6 months after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The median change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training). The total Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer score is reported, with a range 0-66 points, and with higher values indicating better functional status.</description>

    <measure>Median Change in WOLF Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention), and follow-up at 36 weeks (6 months after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The median change in performance time for the WOLF motor function test was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training). The total WOLF motor function timed score is reported here in seconds, with a range 0-1800 seconds, and with lower values indicating faster completion of task and better functional status.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and 36 weeks (6 months after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The median change in Motor Power Manual Muscle Test Score for the upper extremity was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training). The total Motor Power Manual Muscle Test Score is reported here, with a range 0-100 points, and with higher values indicating better functional status.</description>

        <title>Median Change in Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer Assessment Score</title>
        <description>The median change in Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score was calculated from baseline to discharge at 12 weeks (immediately following the intervention) and again at 36 weeks (6 months follow-up from the intervention) in each training condition (sham tDCS + robotics arm training vs. active tDCS + robotic arm training). The total Upper Extremity Fugl Meyer score is reported, with a range 0-66 points, and with higher values indicating better functional status.</description>
