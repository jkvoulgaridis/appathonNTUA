  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of 4 weeks of daily light exposure in reducing
      Post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Fatigue immediately post-treatment and at a one-month
      follow up. The investigators hypothesize that individuals receiving 4 weeks of bright white
      light treatment will report significant reductions in fatigue compared to individuals
      receiving dim red light treatment for the same duration of time, and that these treatment
      effects will be maintained one month after treatment completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of bright white light exposure compared to dim red light exposure
      in reducing post-TBI fatigue, an 8-week, randomized parallel-group clinical trial will be
      performed. Outcome assessment will be blinded. Participants will complete a baseline battery
      (T1) including 72 hours of actigraphy. Participants will then be randomized to either the
      Bright White Light (BWL) or the Dim Red Light (DRL) group. After 4 weeks of daily, 30-minute
      light treatments, the baseline battery will be re-administered (T2) along with 3 more days of
      Actigraphy. A follow-up assessment involving the same measures will be administered 1
      month-post cessation of light therapy (T3). Participant treatment allocations will be masked
      for research team members conducting outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures will be
      administered to explore the effects of light therapy on mood, daytime sleepiness, sleep
      quality, circadian rhythms, anxiety, cognition and life satisfaction.

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) will also be used, to assess daytime sleepiness; it is an 8-item measure that asks about the probability of dozing or sleeping during typical daytime activities and has been widely used in TBI research. Scores correlate well with objective measures of speed of daytime sleep onset. The test is a list of eight situations in which the participate rates tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing for each item. Total scale from 0 to 24, with higher score indicating severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actiwatch Spectrum - Acrophase</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Philips Actiwatch Spectrum to measure circadian rhythms; it is the size and shape of a digital wristwatch and weighs about one ounce. It is worn on an ordinary watchband and is waterproof. Data can be downloaded and analyzed using Actiware software. The Actiwatch Spectrum logs all physical movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer and detects the presence of ambient light (400-700nm), making it a useful measure of circadian cycles because it allows for accurate quantitative assessment of periods of activity, rest and sleep.
Acrophase is time of the peak activity, so it is expressed in hours. The higher the number, the later in the day the peak activity occurs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actiwatch Spectrum - Mesor</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Philips Actiwatch Spectrum to measure circadian rhythms; it is the size and shape of a digital wristwatch and weighs about one ounce. It is worn on an ordinary watchband and is waterproof. Data can be downloaded and analyzed using Actiware software. The Actiwatch Spectrum logs all physical movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer and detects the presence of ambient light (400-700nm), making it a useful measure of circadian cycles because it allows for accurate quantitative assessment of periods of activity, rest and sleep.
Mesor is an adjusted proportion of the difference between the minimum and half the peak, so range is 0-1. Higher means a more rhythmic pattern.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actiwatch Spectrum - F Statistic</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Philips Actiwatch Spectrum to measure circadian rhythms; it is the size and shape of a digital wristwatch and weighs about one ounce. It is worn on an ordinary watchband and is waterproof. Data can be downloaded and analyzed using Actiware software. The Actiwatch Spectrum logs all physical movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer and detects the presence of ambient light (400-700nm), making it a useful measure of circadian cycles because it allows for accurate quantitative assessment of periods of activity, rest and sleep.
F statistic is an F value, so the range is 0 - infinity. It compares two different models of calculating the curve. Higher means a more rhythmic pattern.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4 weeks (end-of-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess treatment credibility (BWL vs. DRL) with the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), used in clinical outcome studies. The CEQ utilizes two scales during the administration (1-9, and 0-100%), and so a composite z score was derived for each factor (expectancy and credibility) by first standardizing the individual items and then summing those items for each factor. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. A higher score indicates more belief or feeling of reduction in anxiety.</description>

        <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) will also be used, to assess daytime sleepiness; it is an 8-item measure that asks about the probability of dozing or sleeping during typical daytime activities and has been widely used in TBI research. Scores correlate well with objective measures of speed of daytime sleep onset. The test is a list of eight situations in which the participate rates tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing for each item. Total scale from 0 to 24, with higher score indicating severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

          <title>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</title>
          <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) will also be used, to assess daytime sleepiness; it is an 8-item measure that asks about the probability of dozing or sleeping during typical daytime activities and has been widely used in TBI research. Scores correlate well with objective measures of speed of daytime sleep onset. The test is a list of eight situations in which the participate rates tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing for each item. Total scale from 0 to 24, with higher score indicating severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

It is worn on an ordinary watchband and is waterproof. Data can be downloaded and analyzed using Actiware software. The Actiwatch Spectrum logs all physical movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer and detects the presence of ambient light (400-700nm), making it a useful measure of circadian cycles because it allows for accurate quantitative assessment of periods of activity, rest and sleep.
Acrophase is time of the peak activity, so it is expressed in hours. The higher the number, the later in the day the peak activity occurs.</description>

        <title>Actiwatch Spectrum - Mesor</title>
        <description>Philips Actiwatch Spectrum to measure circadian rhythms; it is the size and shape of a digital wristwatch and weighs about one ounce. It is worn on an ordinary watchband and is waterproof. Data can be downloaded and analyzed using Actiware software. The Actiwatch Spectrum logs all physical movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer and detects the presence of ambient light (400-700nm), making it a useful measure of circadian cycles because it allows for accurate quantitative assessment of periods of activity, rest and sleep.
Mesor is an adjusted proportion of the difference between the minimum and half the peak, so range is 0-1. Higher means a more rhythmic pattern.</description>
        <time_frame>4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
        <population>After the Actigraph data were cleaned and analyzed, there was clean, usable data for 30 in the white arm and 23 in the red arm.</population>
