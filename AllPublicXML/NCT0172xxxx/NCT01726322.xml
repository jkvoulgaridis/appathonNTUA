  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a translational, mutlicentre study. The aim of this study is to determine whether
      pre-treatment levels of hormones predict ovarian follicular reserve post adjuvant or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and chemotherapy induced amenorrhea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is proposed that levels of AMH and inhibin A and B measured will give an indication of the
      residual ovarian reserve in women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. In addition,
      AMH might give an indication of the possible efficacy of GNRH agonists in fertility
      preservation and the effect on ovarian follicular reserve using different adjuvant
      chemotherapy regimens. Those likely to be offered GNRH agonists are younger women with no
      children and a wish to have some in the future. Older women who have completed their families
      are less likely to be offered a GNRH agonist.
