      The objectives of the PMS are to observe the frequency, type, and degree of device deficiency
      to assure the safety of the new medical device (XIENCE PRIME) as well as to collect
      information on evaluation of the efficacy and safety for reevaluation.

Vascular death: Death due to non-coronary vascular causes such as cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular cause.

        <title>Number of Participants With Cardiac Death or Target Vessel MI (TV-MI)</title>
        <description>Cardiac death is defined as any death in which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded. (This includes but is not limited to acute myocardial infarction, cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality,cerebrovascular accident within 30 days of the procedure or cerebrovascular accident suspected of being related to the procedure, death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery).
TV-MI is defined as myocardial infarction attributed to target vessel myocardial infarction.</description>

          <description>Late procedural outcome is influenced by both the acute gain provided by the intervention (pre to post) and the subsequent late loss that occurs after the intervention (post to follow-up).The net gain is thus the sum of the offsetting effects of acute gain and late loss (net gain = acute gain - late loss).</description>

      <desc>This Surveillance is conducted per the Ministerial Ordinance on Good PMS Practice for Medical Devices to measure the frequency&amp;status of adverse device effects&amp;AEs in order to assure the safety of the new medical device to be evaluated for repeat review by PMDA. PMDA has requested for a combined AE for follow up period, as the difference between both the groups are just based on length of the device,which does not signify a change in the technology but the same technology applies.</desc>
