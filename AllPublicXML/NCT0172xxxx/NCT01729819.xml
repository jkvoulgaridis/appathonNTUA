    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate the efficacy of combining tolterodine and
      desmopressin compared with tolterodine monotherapy in the treatment of women with overactive
      bladder with nocturia in terms of reduction of nocturnal voids during 3 months of treatment

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A nocturnal void was defined as a void occurring at least 5 minutes after going to bed, but before getting up the next morning. The mean estimate was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the respective visit as captured in the voiding and sleep diary.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Time to First Nocturnal Void From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first nocturnal void was defined as the time from going to bed with the intention of sleeping until first nocturnal void or until waking in the morning in the case there is no nocturnal void. The time to first void was calculated as the average over three consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the respective visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Nocturnal Urine Volume From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The mean nocturnal urine volume was derived from the three-day urine volume diary. The nocturnal volume was defined as the sum of the volumes for all nocturnal voids including the volume of the first morning void within 30 min of waking up in the morning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Responder status was defined as ≥33% decrease in the mean number of nocturnal void and at least one night with no voids out of the 3-day diary period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset of Effect as Seen in Change in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids From Baseline for Each Visit During Three Months of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A nocturnal void was defined as a void occurring at least 5 minutes after going to bed, but before getting up the next morning. The mean estimate was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the respective visit as captured in the voiding and sleep diary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Impact on Sleep as Measured by the Sleep Rating Scales From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An electronic diary was used in the trial to document the impact on sleep quality (sleep rating scales). The sleep rating scales included three questions that ranged from 0 (poor) to 10 (good). The average of each question for each visit was summarised and the change from baseline was analysed longitudinally during the three months of treatment.</description>

             (patient-reported)

          -  At least 2 nocturnal voids each night as documented in 2 diary periods during the
             screening. A mean of at least 8 daytime voids per day over 3 days with a minimum of at
             least 6 daytime voids each day as documented in 2 diary periods during the screening.
             At least 1 urgency episode each 24 hours as documented in 2 diary periods during the
             screening. Each diary period consists of 3 consecutive days, with at least 14 days
             between each period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of severe voiding dysfunction defined as:

        More than 10 nocturnal voids per 24 hours as documented on any of the days in both diary
        periods during screening.

      <recruitment_details>This was a multi-centre trial conducted in the US. A total of 33 sites were initiated in this trial, and of these eligible patients from 20 sites were randomised to a treatment. The first patient first visit was on 28 January 2013. The last patient last visit was on 19 November 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial was initiated with a screening period of 3-4 weeks between Visits 1 and 2a, where no investigational medicinal product was taken. Patients who were on a prohibited medication and needed a wash-out period of 1-2 weeks initiated the trial at Visit 0. Eligible patients were randomised to one of the two treatment groups at Visit 2a.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An electronic diary was used in the trial to document the impact on sleep quality (sleep rating scales). The sleep rating scales included three questions that ranged from 0 (poor) to 10 (good). The average of each question for each visit was summarised and the change from baseline was analysed longitudinally during the three months of treatment.</description>
