    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of
      tildrakizumab (SCH 900222/MK-3222) in a population of participants with moderate-to-severe
      plaque psoriasis. The primary hypotheses of the study are that tildrakizumab is superior to
      placebo in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis as measured by the
      proportion of participants achieving &gt;= Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index of 75% (PASI-75)
      response and the proportion of participants with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score
      of &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;minimal&quot; with at least a 2 grade reduction from baseline at Week 12.

      The base study consists of a screening phase of up to 4 weeks followed by a treatment period
      of 52 weeks, and a 20-week follow-up period. The base study treatment period is divided into
      3 sequential parts.

      In Part 1 of the base study (Week 0 to Week 12), participants will be randomized to one of 4
      study arms (Arm A: tildrakizumab 200 mg + matching placebo to etanercept; Arm B:
      tildrakizumab 100 mg + matching placebo to etanercept; Arm C: matching placebo to
      tildrakizumab + matching placebo to etanercept; Arm D: matching placebo to tildrakizumab +
      etanercept 50 mg).

      In Part 2 of the base study (Week 12 to Week 28), participants in Arm A and Arm B will
      receive matching placebo to tildrakizumab to maintain blinding at Week 12 and will receive
      either tildrakizumab 200 mg (Arm A) or tildrakizumab 100 mg (Arm B) at Weeks 12 and 16.
      Participants in Arm A and Arm B will also receive matching placebo to etanercept once weekly
      through study Week 28. At study Week 12, Arm C participants will be re-randomized to receive
      their first dose of tildrakizumab 200 mg or tildrakizumab 100 mg, and will receive additional
      doses of study medication according to their re-randomized treatment assignment at Week 16.
      Participants in Arm C will also receive matching placebo to etanercept through treatment Week
      28. Participants in Arm D will continue with once weekly doses of etanercept through study
      Week 28 in combination with matching placebo to tildrakizumab.

      In Part 3 of the base study (Week 28 to Week 52), participants in Arm A with &gt;= PASI-75
      response at Week 28 will be re-randomized to either continue tildrakizumab 200 mg or receive
      tildrakizumab 100 mg at study Weeks 28, 40, and 52. Participants with &gt;= PASI-50 response but
      &lt; PASI-75 response will continue to receive tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks and those
      participants with &lt; PASI-50 response will be discontinued from the study. Participants in Arm
      B with &gt;= PASI-75 response at Week 28 will continue to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg every 12
      weeks. Those with &gt;= PASI-50 response but &lt; PASI-75 response will be re-randomized to receive
      continued tildrakizumab 100 mg or tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks. Participants in Arm B
      with &lt; PASI-50 response will be discontinued from the study. Participants in Arm C will
      continue to receive treatment every 12 weeks according to their re-randomized treatment
      assignment. Participants in Arm D that achieve &gt;= PASI-75 response at Week 28 will be
      discontinued from the study. Those participants with &lt; PASI-75 response at Week 28 will be
      crossed over to tildrakizumab 200 mg to receive doses at Weeks 32, 36 and 48.

      Eligible participants that choose to enroll in the extension study will have an additional
      treatment period of up to 192 weeks and will be monitored for an additional 20 weeks in the
      follow-up period. Each participant will receive tildrakizumab 200 mg or tildrakizumab 100 mg
      every 12 weeks up to study Week 244 according to their treatment assignment at the conclusion
      of Part 3 of the base study.

    <description>The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighed by the area of involvement. Calculated PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status. Week-28 responder (Wk-28 R) is a participant who achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at Week 28. Week-28 partial responder (Wk-28 PR) is a participant who achieved ≥50% and &lt;75% improvement in PASI response from baseline at Week 28.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a PASI-75 Response at Week 52 (Part 3)</title>
        <description>The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighed by the area of involvement. Calculated PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status. The PASI-75 response indicates the number of participants achieving a 75% reduction in PASI score compared to baseline. Week-28 responder (Wk-28 R) is a participant who achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at Week 28. Week-28 partial responder (Wk-28 PR) is a participant who achieved ≥50% and &lt;75% improvement in PASI response from baseline at Week 28.</description>

          <description>The PGA is used to determine the overall severity of a participant's psoriasis lesions at a given time point. Overall lesions will be graded for thickness, erythema, and scaling on a scale from 0 to 5. The sum of the 3 scales will be divided by 3 to obtain the PGA score. PGA is assessed as: 0= Cleared, except for residual discoloration. 1= Minimal, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 1. 2 =Mild, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 2. 3= Moderate, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 3. 4= Marked, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 4. 5= Severe, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 5.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a PASI-90 Response at Week 52 (Part 3)</title>
        <description>The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighed by the area of involvement. Calculated PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status. The PASI-90 response indicates the number of participants achieving a 90% reduction in PASI score compared to baseline. Week-28 responder (Wk-28 R) is a participant who achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at Week 28. Week-28 partial responder (Wk-28 PR) is a participant who achieved ≥50% and &lt;75% improvement in PASI response from baseline at Week 28.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a PASI-100 Response at Week 52 (Part 3)</title>
          <description>The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighed by the area of involvement. Calculated PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status. The PASI-100 response indicates the number of participants achieving a 90% reduction in PASI score compared to baseline. Week-28 responder (Wk-28 R) is a participant who achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at Week 28. Week-28 partial responder (Wk-28 PR) is a participant who achieved ≥50% and &lt;75% improvement in PASI response from baseline at Week 28.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the DLQI at Week 40 (Part 3)</title>
        <description>The DLQI questionnaire consists of 10 questions, where each question is scored from 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The DLQI score is the sum of the 10 individual question scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. Week-28 responder (Wk-28 R) is a participant who achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at Week 28. Week-28 partial responder (Wk-28 PR) is a participant who achieved ≥50% and &lt;75% improvement in PASI response from baseline at Week 28.</description>

          <description>The DLQI questionnaire consists of 10 questions, where each question is scored from 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The DLQI score is the sum of the 10 individual question scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. Week-28 responder (Wk-28 R) is a participant who achieved ≥ 75% improvement in PASI from baseline at Week 28. Week-28 partial responder (Wk-28 PR) is a participant who achieved ≥50% and &lt;75% improvement in PASI response from baseline at Week 28.</description>
