      this study was proposed to provide more scientific and objective data on the clinical and
      aesthetic effects of these two toxins (Dysport and Xeomin).

      Subjects will perform 6 (six) visits during the study:

      Screening visit, performed 30 to 1 day before the visit 1, when eligible subjects will be
      recruited and first evaluations will be performed; visit 1, which is the baseline and when
      the injections will be performed; visit 2, 30 +/- 3 days after the injections, when
      evaluations will be performed; visit 3, 90 +/- 3 days after the injections, when evaluations
      will be performed; 4, 120 +/- 3 days after the injections, when evaluations will be
      performed; visit 5, 150 +/- 3 days after the injections, when evaluations will be performed.

      Assessment of percentage (%) of responders, after 5 months of injection, to the effects of
      two BT-A preparations, Dysport® and Xeomin®, by measuring frontalis m. wrinkle intensity at
      maximum contraction, as measured by visual Wrinkles Severity Scale (WSS).

    <description>Percentage (%) of responders, after 5 months of injection, to the effects of two botulinum toxin type A (BT-A), Dysport® and Xeomin®. Responders were defined as individuals who presented at least 1 score less in the Wrinkles Scale Score (WSS) at maximum contraction compared to the WSS score at baseline.
WSS is a validated 4-point scale, at rest and at maximum voluntary contraction of the frontalis muscle, in which 0 means no wrinkles up to 3 which means sever wrinkles.</description>

          <title>Evoked Compound Muscle Action Potentials</title>
          <description>The Evoked Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CMAP) is the sum of the action potentials of individual muscle fibers obtained by stimulating a motor nerve. It is obtained through a set surface electrode on the point of the motor muscle and a reference electrode placed on an electrically neutral area (usually on a tendon). The amplitude of the CMAP reflects the number of muscle fibers depolarized in response to a stimulus and is measured in millivolts (mV).</description>
