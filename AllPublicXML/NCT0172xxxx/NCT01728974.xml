  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway recurrently closes during sleep. The mechanisms
      that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. While the airway of some people
      narrows and airflow decreases during inspiration due to increasing inspiratory effort, others
      maintain constant airflow throughout inspiration. Airway neuromuscular reflexes may protect
      against airway narrowing that occurs due to increasing inspiratory effort. To test this
      hypothesis, the investigators will initially measure airway neuromuscular reflex and
      inspiratory flow and then attenuate neuromuscular reflex through topical pharyngeal
      anesthesia to observe the effects on inspiratory flow.

      The mechanisms that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. While the airway of
      some people narrows and airflow decreases during inspiration due to increasing inspiratory
      effort, others maintain constant airflow throughout inspiration (negative effort dependence,
      NED). The investigators hypothesize that upper airway neuromuscular reflexes may protect
      against narrowing that occurs due to increasing inspiratory effort. Topical oropharyngeal
      anesthesia has been shown to reduce neuromuscular reflexes. Thus, the investigators also
      hypothesize that patients with stable inspiratory flow will develop NED once the reflexes
      have been impaired with topical anesthetic. The investigators plan to:

        1. measure upper airway muscle EMG to assess how it corresponds to the presence or absence
           of NED. This aim will allow us to test the hypothesis that robust upper airway muscle
           reflexes can protect against NED.

        2. reduce upper airway muscle activity and reflexes by topical oropharyngeal anesthesia.
           This will allow us to test the hypothesis that attenuated upper airway muscle activity
           induced by topical anesthesia can induce NED.
