      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of umbilical cord blood-derived
      natural killer cells when given together with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and high dose
      melphalan before autologous stem cell transplant and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma. Before transplant, stem cells are taken from patients and
      stored. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as elotuzumab, may induce changes in
      the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide and melphalan, may work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell
      transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them.
      Giving natural killer cells from donor umbilical cord blood before transplant may also kill
      myeloma cells that remain in the body after the last chemotherapy treatment. After treatment,
      stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were
      destroyed by the chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived natural
      killer (NK) cells.

      II. To determine efficacy by the percent of patients achieving very good partial remission
      (VGPR) + complete remission (CR) at 3 months post-transplant.

      III. To assess the minimal residual disease rate 100 days post-transplant in high-risk
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To quantify duration of infused allogeneic donor UCB-derived NK cells in the recipient.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of UCB-derived NK cells.

      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-5 hours on day -15 and -8, lenalidomide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -8 to -2, high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day
      -7, and UCB-derived NK cells IV over 1 hour on day -5. Patients undergo autologous stem cell
      transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60 and 100 days and 6
      and 12 months.
