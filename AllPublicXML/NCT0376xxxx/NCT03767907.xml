    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a
      Computer-based Training for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT4CBT) to treatment as usual in
      outpatients seeking treatment for substance use disorder.

    <textblock>
      Fifty-two adult outpatients seeking treatment for substance use disorder from the Centre for
      Addiction and Mental Health Addictions Program will be randomized to receive either a
      computer-based training for cognitive behavioural therapy or treatment as usual for eight
      weeks. Participants will complete interviews, questionnaires, and other assessments (urine
      toxicology and physiological assessments) at week 0, at week 8, and at 6 month follow-up).
      Measures will assess alcohol and drug consumption, substance use disorder symptoms and
      associated features, quality of life, and healthcare costs.

    <description>Computer-based training for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT4CBT) consists of seven modules, and includes a series of interactive videos presenting characters portrayed by professional actors struggling with real-life situations. These characters first experience a common risky situation or problem and then demonstrate the application of a targeted skill. The program further comprises games and interactive exercises to teach and model effective use of skills and strategies.</description>
