  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iliac crest autogenous bone graft is accepted as the most effective method for secondary
      alveolar cleft repair. However this method is associated with complications. As an
      alternative, mesenchymal stem cells associated with biomaterials have been used for the
      rehabilitation of the alveolar bone cleft of patients with cleft lip and palate. This is a
      RCT comparing mesenchymal stem cells obtained from autogenous deciduous dental pulp
      associated with biomaterials versus iliac crest autogenous bone graft for secondary alveolar
      cleft repair.

    <description>Assessed by CLEFT-Q, a self-report PRO instrument, tool answered independently patients themselves, without interpretation by the parent(s) or healthcare provider. The CLEFT-Q consists of 13 independently functioning domains (171 items) measuring appearance, facial function and quality of life. Each domain is composed of a series of items that together evaluate a unidimensional construct. A higher score means a better result (continuous outcome, measured by: mean)</description>
