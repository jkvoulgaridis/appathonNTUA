  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer progresses rapidly and has a higher death rate. Albumin-bound paclitaxel is
      a new generation of paclitaxel . Albumin-bound paclitaxel is recommended as a class 1A
      evidence treating patients with pancreatic cancer.The purpose of this study was to further
      observe and evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel in the
      treatment of non-operative locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and to explore
      the prognostic factors .

      This is a prospective, single-arm, observational study. After the subjects meet the inclusive
      and exclusive criteria, then they will receive albumin-bound paclitaxel treatment. The
      researchers can choose the treatment based on albumin-bound paclitaxel and choose dosage
      according to the patient's condition.

      Patients enrolled in the study underwent whole-gene sequencing based on their willingness to
      take tumor tissue samples and blood samples.All samples need tissue samples and peripheral
      blood as control. Tissue samples can be wax blocks, fresh surgical tissues,tissues through
      puncture biopsy, laparoscopic biopsy and other biopsy. Sampling should be conducted within 1
      week before enrollment.
