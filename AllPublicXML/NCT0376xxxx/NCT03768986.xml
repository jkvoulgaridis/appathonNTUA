  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American and Latina women, as well as women living in poverty, are an identified
      health disparities population for HIV. Risks for HIV are compounded in this population when
      additional risk factors are present, including other sexually transmitted infections,
      intimate partner violence, substance use disorders, and homelessness or housing insecurity.
      Knowledge of one's HIV serostatus is key to linkage to care, improving HIV outcomes, and
      decreasing the spread of HIV. However, roughly a third of African American women and over
      half of Latina women have never been tested (CDC, 2016a). Barriers to testing include
      socioeconomical inequality, racial discrimination, low health literacy, and inadequate access
      to quality healthcare, among others. Novel methods for increasing HIV testing in this
      important health disparities group are greatly needed.

      This study aims to test a reinforcement-based intervention to increase HIV testing and repeat
      testing among African American, Latina, and women living in poverty who have risk factors for
      HIV. We are partnering with multiple community-based organizations, several of which are
      non-traditional providers of HIV services (e.g., domestic violence agency, homeless shelter),
      to address systemic and structural issues that serve as barriers to testing. A primary aim is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of training community-based providers to deliver a
      reinforcement-based intervention for promoting HIV testing. In addition, we will compare
      standard referral services for HIV testing plus HIV risk reduction education to the same plus
      reinforcement for HIV testing (and repeat testing) using a randomized controlled trial with
      334 participants. Women in both groups will be encouraged to seek HIV testing; be provided
      with the resources to do so (list of testing sites, bus passes if needed); and will receive
      basic education about HIV prevention using a widely available web-based resource
      (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/). Women in the reinforcement group will also be provided with
      $25 for undergoing an HIV test, with a $15 bonus if they have the test in the next 7 days
      ($40 total). During the next 12 months, they can receive an additional $25 for undergoing up
      to 2 more tests separated by 12 weeks, with $15 bonuses for each test completed within 7 days
      (+/- 7 days) of the scheduled date at 6- and 12-months post-initial test. It is hypothesized
      that the reinforcement intervention will result in greater proportions of women receiving an
      HIV test (and repeat HIV tests) compared to standard services.

      In the proposed study, approximately 50 clinicians from our partner sites will be trained on
      both the non-reinforcement and reinforcement approaches to increasing HIV testing. Primary
      clinician outcomes are clinician knowledge and attitudes about HIV, testing, and
      reinforcement interventions. These will be assessed pre- and post-training and at 6-month
      intervals thereafter. A secondary outcome is clinician satisfaction with the training. Once
      clinicians are trained to competence, 334 women at our partner agencies will be randomized.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and at 3-, 9-, and 15-month follow-ups. The primary
      outcome is objective reports of HIV testing, verified by testing centers. Secondary outcomes
      are HIV risk behaviors, test results, self-efficacy, client attitudes towards testing, and
      HIV knowledge. In addition, this study will include a careful analysis of costs of the
      reinforcement intervention to allow for estimates of its cost-effectiveness in increasing HIV
      testing.

      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether a reinforcement intervention delivered
      by community providers is superior to standard referral procedures plus HIV education in
      increasing rates of HIV testing among women at the highest risk of HIV infection. A wide
      range of community partners that serve some of the highest risk groups of women were chosen
      to ensure highly generalizable results. If efficacious, the intervention has the potential
      for widespread adoption and implementation.
