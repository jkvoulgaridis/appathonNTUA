    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in order to assess the need for dose adjustment for elafibranor
      in patients with hepatic impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters of elafibranor and its active
      metabolite (GFT1007) will be compared in hepatic impaired patients (mild, moderate and severe
      according to Child-Pugh categories) versus healthy participants after a single oral
      administration of elafibranor 120 mg.
