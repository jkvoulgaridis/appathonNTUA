  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who are
      scheduled to have their tumor surgically removed. The study involves obtaining baseline
      tissue from a clinical biopsy or research biopsy and measurement of circulating tumor cells
      before surgery to determine whether AXL protein expression pre-treatment correlates to
      clinical outcomes (change in tumor size) after two doses of cetuximab. The importance of this
      study is to describe if AXL expression can be used as a biomarker to predict clinical
      response to cetuximab (CTX) treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a window of opportunity trial evaluating the hypothesis that AXL levels correlate
      with clinical response to cetuximab in head and neck patients. Patients with head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma who are scheduled to undergo surgical resection of their tumor and
      are candidates for cetuximab chemotherapy are eligible to participate.

      Primary:

      1. To test the hypothesis that low AXL correlates with clinical response to cetuximab in head
      and neck cancer patients

      Secondary:

      1. To further describe the safety of pre-operative administration of cetuximab

      Correlative:

        1. To correlate AXL expression with change in Ki67 following cetuximab in Head and Neck
           Cancer (HNC) patients

        2. To examine other putative markers of cetuximab sensitivity such as HER3 and change in
           circulating tumor cells

        3. To establish the first panel of patient-derived xenografts from patients with known
           sensitivity or resistance to cetuximab

      Following informed consent, tumor tissue from the research biopsy and a blood draw for
      circulating tumor cells will be obtained. The participant will then receive two weekly doses
      of pre-operative cetuximab during the interval between diagnostic biopsy and surgery (~14
      days), ensuring that no delay in standard of care (SOC) will occur.

      For dose #1, participants will receive cetuximab 400 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion over 2
      hours (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min) as per the standard of care loading regimen for
      cetuximab monotherapy.

      For dose #2, participants will receive cetuximab 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion over 1
      hour (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min) as per the standard of care dosing regimen for
      cetuximab monotherapy.

      At the time of surgery, another blood draw will be obtained for analysis of circulating tumor
      cells, and a portion of the resected tumor will be obtained for study analysis.

      Correlative studies will include the measurement of proteins hypothesized to be involved in
      cetuximab resistance such as AXL, Ki67, EGFR, and HER3 expression from both the biopsy and
      the surgical specimen. Blood will be analyzed for correlative analysis of circulating tumor
      cells. Tissue from the research biopsy will be utilized for participant-derived xenograft
      (PDX) development.

    <description>Markers include: protein, RNA, circulating tumor cells with CTX response, measured by Ki67. Correlation between ΔKi67 and putative biomarkers will be analyzed as a continuous variable and will be tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Correlation between two biomarkers such as AXL and HER3 expression as continuous variables will be investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Summary statistics will be used to report circulating tumor cells at each time point and the changes between time points. The association of change in circulating tumor cells with ΔKi67 (early response) will be explored graphically and with Pearson's correlation coefficient.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Informed consent: participants must be informed of the investigational nature of the study
        and must be able to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Inclusion criteria for research biopsy (screen)

               -  Participants must have suspected or known clinical presentation of head and neck
                  squamous cell carcinoma or a recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
                  after initial therapy. For newly suspected head and neck cancer, the procedure
                  will obtain tissue for both standard of care biopsy and additional tissue for
                  research.

               -  Participants must have sufficient tumor volume (approximately 10 cc) to
                  accommodate at minimum 2-3 core samples for the research biopsy. This will be
                  approximated based on clinical evidence, such as physician visualization or
                  palpitation.

               -  Participants are required to consent to the TSB Biobank protocol (2016-0934) as
                  part of this study.

               -  Surgical management must be the chosen modality for management of the head and
                  neck squamous cell cancer.

                    -  Other therapeutic modalities may follow, but surgery must be the choice for
                       first therapy rendered.

          -  Inclusion criteria for cetuximab treatment:

               -  Participants must have a biopsy proven, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
                  neck, excluding advanced cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant (confirmed by a
                  negative urine/serum pregnancy test within 7 days of cetuximab treatment). In
                  addition, a medically acceptable method of birth control must be used such as an
                  oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal contraceptive, an
                  intrauterine device (IUD), use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge,
                  diaphragm, or vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), or total
                  abstinence during the study participation and for 6 months after last dose of
                  study drug. Women who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically
                  sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) are
                  not considered to be WOCP.

               -  Men who are not surgically or medically sterile must agree to use an acceptable
                  method of contraception. Male participants with female sexual partners who are
                  pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must agree to use
                  condoms during the study and for 6 months post study drug. Total abstinence for
                  the same study period is an acceptable alternative.

               -  Participants with other concomitant malignancies are allowed to participate on
                  the clinical trial as long as the surgical resection of the head and neck
                  squamous cell carcinoma is clinically indicated.
