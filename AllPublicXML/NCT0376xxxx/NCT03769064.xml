  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current abuse liability study aims to assess the potential for co-administration of
      naltrexone (NTX) to reduce the abuse potential of methylphenidate (MPH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The abuse of MPH, as a Schedule II substance, is a well-documented problem. Studies in animal
      models, including primates, show that high-dose MPH can produce reinforcement or reward. A
      number of studies suggest that the rapid elevation of MPH levels in the blood and brain that
      occurs following intranasal or oral administration of supra-therapeutic doses is a key
      requirement for development of MPH-associated euphoria, reinforcement, and addiction. The
      concerns about MPH abuse potential and addiction often play a role in the decision of
      patients, parents, or physicians who opt against treatment with MPH, despite its
      effectiveness. This provides an imperative for development of MPH formulations that are
      therapeutically potent but with lower abuse potential. Methylphenidate acts mainly through
      the dopaminergic system. At sufficiently high doses, MPH can also activate the mu opioid
      receptors (MOPR) in the brain. Recent data indicate that blockade of MOPRs by naltrexone
      (NTX) blocks the rewarding effects of MPH in mice. Clinical studies on the modulatory effect
      of NTX on dopamine release following chronic amphetamine use also support the involvement of
      opioid-dopamine interactions in the reinforcing and rewarding effects of amphetamine. These
      data support the hypothesis that NTX will block the reinforcing effect of MPH in humans.

    <description>To evaluate the maximum effect of 2 doses (50 and 100 mg) of Naltrexone on the abuse potential of a single dose (60 mg) of Methylphenidate in healthy recreational stimulant users using the bipolar Visual Analogue Scale for Drug Liking.
Visual Analogue Scale (bipolar) is an administered test where the patient assess the following.:
• Drug Liking, Overall Drug Liking, Alertness/Drowsiness, Overall Take the Drug Again;
The response anchors are 0 (strong disliking), 50 (neither like nor dislike), and 100 (strong liking).
Visual Analogue Scale for Drug Liking will be determined periodically over the 8 hour period following each dose administration to assess for response to test question, &quot;At this moment, my liking for this drug is...&quot;.</description>

                  non-childbearing potential must present a proof of postmenopausal status and/or
                  partial or total hysterectomy; if such proof is not available, the female will be

          6. Subjects must agree to refrain from use of any prescription or over-the-counter
             medications (with the exception of stable oral, implanted, or injected contraceptive
             hormones) or herbal remedies and consumption of any alcohol within the exclusionary
             periods and throughout the study.

          7. Subjects must be able to speak, read, and understand English in order to complete the
             study assessments.

             overnight stays at the study site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of moderate or severe substance use disorder (excluding nicotine and/or
             caffeine) within the past 2 years, as defined by the DSM-V, or has a lifetime history
             of participation in a drug rehabilitation program (excluding past participation in
             tobacco smoking cessation program or previous court-mandated treatment).

          2. History of opioid dependence.

          3. Subject has a positive urine drug or alcohol screen upon admission into the clinic at
             the start of the Qualification or Treatment Phase (Day -1 of Parts 1 and 2), except
             for cannabinoids (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]), which may be seen because of
             the long half-life of THC and slow release from adipose tissue. If THC is positive,
             inclusion will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Tests with positive results
             may be repeated and/or subjects may be rescheduled at the Investigator's discretion.

             Screening and prior to administration of any study drug that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, increases the risk to the subject of participation in the study. For
             these parameters, out-of-range values that are not clinically significant (as
             determined by the Investigator) may be repeated twice and the subject may be enrolled
             if at least 1 repeated value is within acceptable range.

             the study.

          6. Any clinically significant medical history that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             increases the risk to the subject of participation in the study.

          7. A history of a major surgical procedure within 30 days prior to the start of study
             drug administration (Day 1 of Part 1), or any planned surgery during the study.

             drug administration (Day 1 of Part 1), as determined by the Investigator.

          9. History of liver disease.

         10. History of narrow-angle glaucoma, based on medical history and/or subject
             self-reporting.

             Investigator.

         16. Presence or history of any medically diagnosed, clinically significant Axis I
             psychiatric disorder (including bipolar disorder, mood disorder, anxiety disorder,
             thought disorder, any psychotic disorder).

         17. Presence of acute suicidality (within 6 months of Screening), as evidenced by a
             positive response to Question 4 or 5 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
             (C-SSRS), indicating active suicidal ideation with any intent to act, at Screening or
             Check-in for each part.

         18. Lifetime history of suicidal behavior such that a determination of &quot;yes&quot; is made on
             the Suicidal Behavior section of the C-SSRS for &quot;Actual Attempt,&quot; &quot;Interrupted
             Attempt,&quot; &quot;Aborted Attempt,&quot; or &quot;Preparatory Acts or Behavior&quot;.
