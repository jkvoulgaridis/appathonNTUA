      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter, two Arm (Treatment or &quot;Scaffold&quot;
      Arm; Standard of Care or &quot;Comparator&quot; Arm) of a Neuro-Spinal Scaffold to evaluate whether the
      Scaffold is safe and demonstrates probable benefit for the treatment of complete T2-T12

      This is a randomized, controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter Humanitarian Device
      Exemption (HDE) study to evaluate the safety and probable benefit of the
      poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(L-lysine) Scaffold (&quot;Scaffold&quot;) in subjects with
      thoracic AIS A traumatic spinal cord injury at neurological level of injury of T2-T12 as
      compared to standard of care open spine surgery. Subjects will be randomized in a blinded
      manner to one of two study arms, the Treatment or &quot;Scaffold&quot; Arm and the Standard of Care or
      &quot;Comparator&quot; Arm. Subjects in the Scaffold Arm will have the Scaffold implantation
      immediately following standard of care open spine surgery. Subjects in the Comparator Arm
      will have standard of care open spine surgery and will not receive the Scaffold. The subjects
      will be blinded to their study arm for the duration of the study.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate whether the Scaffold is safe and demonstrates probable benefit
      for the treatment of complete T2-T12 spinal cord injury as compared to standard of care open
      spine surgery.

      Regulatory Objective: To enhance the clinical evidence for the Scaffold in the treatment of
      complete thoracic spinal cord injuries.

      Intended Use: The Scaffold is intended for use in patients age 16-70 years diagnosed with a
      T2-T12 neurological level of injury functionally complete (AIS A) spinal cord injury for whom
      open spine surgery, (e.g., laminectomy, spine stabilization) which allows access to the dura
      of the injured spinal cord, is recommended as an option. The Scaffold is intended to be
      implanted in a cavity at the epicenter of the spinal cord contusion during open spine
      surgery. The Scaffold is intended for use in recent (≤7 days) spinal cord injuries that do
      not involve penetrating injury to the cord or complete severing of the cord.

    <description>The investigational product (&quot;Neuro-Spinal ScaffoldTM&quot; or &quot;Scaffold&quot;) is a porous bioresorbable polymer scaffold comprised of a synthetic biomaterial, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(L-lysine) (PLGA-PLL). The Scaffold is cylindrical in shape (3 mm diameter) and is available is three lengths (6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm) for optimal fit in the intraspinal lesion cavity.
Based upon pre-clinical testing, the Scaffold is expected to be resorbed from the site of implant within 4 to 8 weeks.</description>

          7. Spinal cord injury associated with significant traumatic brain injury or coma that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude adequate assessment of spinal cord

         13. A female who is:

               -  Pregnant, or planning to become pregnant within the next 12-months; or

             or receiving medical treatment, or having any other reason that, in the judgment of
             the Investigator, precludes successful participation and follow-up for at least six
