  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further understand the impact of acute sleep deprivation and recovery sleep on the
      processing of emotional information the investigators will address and attempt to answer
      three questions, (i) how both undisturbed sleep and sleep deprivation affect the processing
      and retrieval of emotional information, (ii) what neural and psychophysiological mechanisms
      are associated with these behavioral effects, and (iii) to explore the ability of recovery
      sleep to reverse the effects of sleep deprivation. Together, these studies will provide a
      greater breadth and depth of knowledge concerning sleep's role in emotion processing and
      regulation. Given the growing societal tendency to view sleep as unproductive—foregoing it to
      lengthen work days and increase social opportunities— such knowledge would be of practical
      importance for understanding the role of sleep in healthy emotional functioning, particular
      for individuals experiencing periods of increased stress and emotional distress (e.g., new
      parents, hospital staff, or combat troops).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goal 1: How does sleep deprivation impact emotion perception and memory processing? The
      investigators are interested in how an acute loss of sleep impairs our ability to properly
      perceive, consolidate, and retrieve emotional information. There has been research on the
      effect of sleep deprivation on broad areas of cognition, such as attention, working memory,
      and reasoning ability, but the impact of sleep loss on emotional processing and regulation
      remains largely unexplored. The investigators aim to characterize how sleep deprivation
      compared to undisturbed sleep affects the ability to accurately perceive emotion, how it
      alters the intensity with which emotions are perceived, and the effect that these changes
      have on the subsequent consolidation and memory retrieval for emotional compared to neutral
      information.

      Goal 2: How are these changes reflected in the neural signal and with psychophysiological
      measures? The investigators will utilize fMRI and measures of autonomic reactivity (heart
      rate and skin conductance) to characterize the neural and psychophysiological mechanisms
      underlying these behavioral changes following sleep deprivation compared to a normal night of
      sleep. This will allow us to pinpoint the brain regions involved in changes following sleep
      deprivation, and associate these changes with effects on downstream physiological responses.

      Goal 3: Can a nap after sleep deprivation restore normal processing of emotional memory and
      rescue the neural and autonomic markers of sleep deprivation? The investigators are
      interested in determining if a brief period of recovery sleep is enough to combat the
      behavioral, neural, and autonomic effects of acute sleep loss, thus a portion of the
      sleep-deprived participants will be given a 2-hour nap opportunity to quantify its
      restorative effects. Such information would form the foundation for future research extending
      and translating these findings into effective sleep-based interventions for healthy and
      clinical populations alike.

    <measure>Morphed Face Accuracy and Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to identify and rate emotional intensity of ambiguous emotional faces (happy, sad, angry) that have been morphed with neutral faces. Scores for each emotional domain will be calculated as (i) accuracy score (number of faces correctly identified over total faces seen), and (ii) average emotional intensity rating. Task will be completed at baseline, post-sleep/sleep deprivation, and post-nap/no nap, and within-subject comparisons will determine how interventions impact emotional perception.</description>

    <measure>Emotional Memory Tradeoff Memory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Following sleep or sleep deprivation, participants will complete emotional memory tradeoff recognition task at two time points, separated by a nap or wakefulness. Corrected hit rate will be calculated for negative and neutral scene components as the percentage of correctly identified &quot;old&quot; objects/backgrounds minus percentage of false alarms (&quot;new&quot; pictures marked as &quot;old&quot;)</description>
