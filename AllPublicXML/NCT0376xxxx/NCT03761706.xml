  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine if engagement in physical activity during chemotherapy will have a
      moderating effect on increases in p16 levels during chemotherapy.

      Participants: 100 patients age 21-64 with a Stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis who are about
      to start adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Procedures: The study entails screening, recruiting and consenting 100 eligible breast cancer
      patients who are about to begin adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and agree to participate
      in a physical activity intervention, maintain a printed daily exercise log, wear a FitBit,
      complete questionnaires and assessments, and provide blood samples at various time points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall focus of this study remains the investigation of associations between p16 and
      assessments (independent and patient-reported) of chemotherapy-related toxicity (adverse
      events and symptoms) and patient-reported measures of function and quality of life. The
      research team has determined that p16 increases dramatically during chemotherapy and that p16
      levels among persons of similar age are lower among those who exercise as compared to those
      who are sedentary. The research team hypothesizes that engagement in physical activity during
      chemotherapy will have a moderating effect on increases in p16 levels during chemotherapy. To
      test this hypothesis, the study proposes to build on a completed trial, LCCC1334, and enroll
      100 evaluable patients age 21-64 with a Stage I-III breast cancer diagnosis who are about to
      start adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an intervention that entails both aerobic and
      resistance exercises.

      Results from both LCCC1334 and the proposed study, LCCC1749, will be used to provide evidence
      for a future grant application to conduct a randomized controlled trial in a larger study
      population to (1) establish the effect of physical activity on p16 levels during chemotherapy
      and (2) further evaluate how baseline and post-chemotherapy p16 levels correlate with
      measures of treatment-related toxicity and patient-reported outcomes over time. Findings from
      this study will also provide preliminary evidence for further investigations of the potential
      benefits of exercise during early breast cancer chemotherapy for (1) reducing the incidence
      and severity of peripheral neuropathy and (2) managing the interface of fatigue and perceived
      cognition deficits.

    <description>This is a one-arm intervention study that includes assessments and questionnaires at several time points as early stage breast cancer patients undergo chemotherapy and at 6 months post-chemotherapy. Study participants will be asked to wear a FitBit provided by the research team and agree to FitBit data downloads during regularly scheduled chemotherapy clinic visits to evaluate engagement in physical activity. Study participants will complete questionnaires, an exercise log, and submit blood samples as multiple time points.</description>

          -  Scheduled to begin an appropriate adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen as
             defined by NCCN guidelines (www.nccn.org). Patients receiving anti-HER-2 therapy are
             eligible but the intervention will only be tested during the chemotherapy portion of
             the regimen.

          -  English speaking

          -  IRB approved, signed written informed consent

          -  Approval from their treating physician to engage in moderate-intensity physical
             activity

          -  Patient-assessed ability to walk and engage in moderate physical activity

          -  Willing and able to meet all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from
             study participation. Exclusion criteria are:

          -  One or more significant medical conditions that in the physician's judgment preclude
             participation in the walking or strength training intervention.

          -  Unable to walk or engage in moderate-intensity physical activity.
