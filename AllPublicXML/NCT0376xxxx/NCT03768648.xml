  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is nowadays more and more recognized as an important feature of the
      multiple sclerosis (MS) disease which contributes largely to disability. Cognitive assessment
      using classical neuropsychological tests are poorly correlated with patient's complaints and
      daily functioning. Ecological evaluations, recent and innovative way to assess cognitive
      functions with the true impact of cognitive impairment in everyday daily life of patients.
      One goal of an ecological test could be to identify MS patients in whom cognitive impairment
      has a strong interaction with daily life. Different type of ecological evaluation have been
      recently proposed in MS, including assessment cognitive tasks in a virtual reality
      environment using the Urban DailyCog® software developed in our laboratory (Hamel et al,
      2015). Virtual reality environment assessments are promising in detecting cognitive
      impairment while providing friendly assessments for patients and simulating daily activities.
      . Cognitive dysfunction is correlated with white matter diffuse injury in relapsing-remitting
      MS (RRMS) patients and brain atrophy However, the relationships between structural brain
      damage and brain connectivity with cognitive functioning assessed by ecological evaluation
      are also unknown. The use of new techniques for morphological and functional MRI can study
      the contribution of diffuse white matter (WM) alteration and diffuse gray matter (GM)
      alterations in cognitive impairment and on their evolution.

      The objectives are to evaluate the ecological assessment (Urban DailyCog® and actual reality)
      to detect cognitive impairment in everyday daily life of patients and their changes and to
      investigate structural WM and GM damages and the dynamic of functional connectivity for
      explaining and predicting cognitive disability during two years in RRMS patients treated by
      the same treatment Aubagio®.

    <description>The composite z ecological score is the average of z ecological scores of virtual reality task (Urban DailyCog©) and actual reality tests. Z-scores will be calculated for each cognitive score with the following formula: (patient's score - mean value of HC group matched for age, sex, and education level)/standard deviation of the matched HC for each evaluation time (baseline and 2 years).</description>

    <description>The composite z cognitive score is the average of z individual cognitive scores. The score from each cognitive test is transformed into z-scores. Z-scores will be calculated for each cognitive score with the following formula: (patient's score - mean value of HC group matched for age, sex, and education level)/standard deviation of the matched HC for each evaluation time. Individual neuropsychological scores included in composite z cognitive score : the Alertness subtest, the divided attention subtest and the visual-scanning subtest from the TAP, The Symbol-digit-modalities-test, the Paced-Auditory-Serial-Addition-Test 3s, reversed span, the Stroop test, the Verbal fluency, Trail Making test, the California Verbal memory learning test and the Brief visual memory test -revised.</description>
