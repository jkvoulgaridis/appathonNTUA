  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of,
      and the tolerability and acceptance of an intravaginal ring (IVR) delivering both tenofovir
      and levonorgestrel (TFV/LNG) and an IVR delivering TFV only, compared to a placebo IVR, in
      women in Western Kenya.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a clinical trial will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of, and the tolerability and adherence to two novel intravaginal rings (IVRs). The
      tenofovir/levonorgestrel (TFV/LNG) IVR and TFV IVRs are designed to provide HIV (and HSV-2)
      prevention with and without contraceptive for pregnancy prevention, respectively. Women will
      be protected from pregnancy by abstinence from vaginal intercourse or agreeing to
      consistently use condoms; concurrent use of a non-hormonal copper intrauterine device is
      permitted.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-negative, non-pregnant, menstruating women aged 18-34
      years, inclusive, and not currently infected with hepatitis B virus, who are assessed to be
      at lower risk for HIV. The goal is to enroll fifty (50) women in Western Kenya. The
      participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to use one of the following continuous delivery IVRs:
      twenty (20) women to use the TFV/LNG IVR; ten (10) women to use the TFV IVR; and ten (10)
      women to use the placebo IVR. Participants will attend up to ten (10) routine study visits
      that may include physical and pelvic exams, collection of venous blood, vaginal fluid and
      cervical mucus, and behavioral questionnaires. A subset of twenty (20) women will participate
      in in-depth interviews.
