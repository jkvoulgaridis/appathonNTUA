  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of GRT0151Y that is tolerable and
      to explore the safety profile of the drug.

      For each Treatment Period (Visits 2-5), dosing will be separated by at least one week.
      Participants in this study will receive up to four doses of the study drug and up to two
      placebo (an inactive substance) preparations, one at a time on each of up to six visits.
      Participants will receive a single dose of either GRT0151Y or placebo beginning with the
      lowest dose of study drug 150 milligrams (mg), followed by 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg and
      400 mg doses of the study drug. Participants will only be allowed to proceed to the next
      higher dose of GRT0151Y (or placebo) if the previous dose was well tolerated. Neither the
      participant nor the study staff will know whether participants are receiving GRT0151Y or
      placebo.

    <description>Manual-tracking test with a simultaneous visual target detection component. Participant is provided with joystick and presented with the image of an airplane and a randomly curving road; participant has to position the airplane over the center of the road while being distracted repeatedly by visual targets they have to respond to. Percentage of time over the road (milliseconds), response latency of correct responses and percentage of target hits are recorded.</description>

    <description>Choice reaction time (CRT) is a computerized assessment that trains the participant to respond to stimuli presented on the screen. The task requires the participant to react as soon as a colored key appears in one of up to eight locations. The participant must respond by lifting their finger from the central start button and depressing the corresponding response key as quickly as possible. This is the reaction time (RT). Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

          -  Acceptable body mass index (BMI) (weight [kilograms]/height (square meter) range of 19
             to 30 kilograms per square meter, inclusive).

          -  Signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and
             procedures required for the study, and are willing to participate in the study.

          -  Participants with a history of recreational opiate use (defined as nontherapeutic use
             at least 10 times in the past year and at least once in the last 12 weeks prior to
             screening) but not dependent on opiates Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders-4th edition (DSM-IV criteria).

          -  Participants must consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception
             throughout the entire study period, including washout periods. For all females of
             childbearing potential only: adequate contraception is defined as any form of hormonal
             contraception or intra-uterine device that needs to be in place for a period of at
             least two months prior to screening. Additional barrier contraception must be used for
             the duration of the study, defined as from the time of the enrolment visit to the
             final examination, and for at least one full month thereafter. A single barrier method
             alone or abstinence alone is not acceptable. Women of non-childbearing potential may
             be included if surgically sterile or post-menopausal for at least two years.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (beta- Human chorionic gonadotropin) at the enrolment visit. For females of
             childbearing potential, the time between the enrolment visit and first receipt of drug
             will be separated by a minimum of 10 days to ensure accuracy of the pregnancy test.

          -  Participants with a positive urine drug screen (for amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, phencyclidine and opiates) upon presentation
             at enrolment will be allowed to continue only if the investigator or designee
             considers that the presence of the drug will not introduce additional risk factors for
             the study participant, or interfere with study procedures or data integrity. Positive
             drug screens for select drugs are to be confirmed using quantitative methods such as
             GC/MS or equivalent, and the investigator or designee's decision to allow participants
             to continue will take into account the quantitative levels of drug in the subjects'
             urine. Participants may be rescheduled for another treatment period at the
             investigator's discretion.

          -  Deemed healthy on the basis of enrolment visit physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters (serum/urine biochemistry, urinalysis,
             clotting, blood sedimentation rate (BSR), haematology and hepatitis and human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus serology). If the results of the laboratory tests
             or the urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges, the
             participant can be included only on condition that the investigator or designee judges
             that the deviations are not clinically relevant and do not interfere with the study
             objectives.

          -  Must have a negative breath alcohol analysis at enrolment. A positive alcohol reading
             is one that is above the error measurement associated with the breathalyzer.
             Participants presenting a positive alcohol breath test may be allowed to continue in
             the study only if the investigator (or designee) considers that the presence of breath
             alcohol does not suggest problematic alcohol consumption, and will not introduce
             additional risk factors for the study participant, or interfere with study procedures
             or data integrity.

          -  Ability to speak, read and understand English sufficiently to understand the nature of
             the study, to provide written informed consent and to allow completion of all study
