  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes contributes significantly to the burden of disease in Norway and cardiovascular
      disease is the main cause of mortality.

      Both lean and fatty fish are shown to have beneficial health effects. In addition to omega-3
      fatty acids, fish contain potential health-promoting components such as taurine, vitamin D,
      vitamin B12, iodine, selenium and more unspecified components such as bioactive peptides.
      With the expected growth in the aquaculture sector, more protein-rich by-products will become
      available.

      The overall aim of this project is to investigate the health beneficial effects of fish
      protein in the form of salmon fishmeal in a human intervention study with regard to metabolic
      risk markers.

      We will include subjects with impaired glucose tolerance to a randomized controlled parallel
      study. The subjects will receive capsules with fishmeal or placebo.
