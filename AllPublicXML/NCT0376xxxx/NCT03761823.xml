  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a widely used treatment on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
      Swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) after extubation may cause aspiration, and is associated
      with poor outcomes: pneumonia, reintubation, a prolonged length of hospital stay and
      increased mortality. The exact underlying pathophysiology of post-extubation dysphagia (PED)
      is unknown. This exploratory pilot study is the first step that aims to fill this knowledge
      gap to ultimately improve current treatment and prevention of post-extubation dysphagia.

      Using FEES (Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing), HRIM (High Resolution Impedance
      Manometry) and EMG (electromyography) simultaneously, 5 healthy subjects and 25 patients
      within 24 hours after extubation will be studied.

      Observational study model:

      The group of healthy subjects will be recruited using posters at the local university and the
      internet. The healthy subjects will be studied before the group of patients to assess the
      feasibility and possible interactions of simultaneously recording FEES, HRIM and EMG. Then,
      the group of patients will be studied. They will be recruited from the Intensive Care Unit.
      See In- and Exclusion criteria for details.

    <description>The pathophysiology of PED will be determined after simultaneous measurement of FEES, HRIM and EMG. The pathophysiology will be classified into several categories: reduced pharyngeal contractility / muscular weakness, reduced upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening/relaxation, direct oropharyngeal or laryngeal trauma of the tube, reduced laryngeal sensibility, among other categories. To enable classification, parameters obtained from FEES, HRIM and EMG will be used. FEES: presence of penetration and aspiration, residue, reduced sensibility (among others); HRIM: pharyngeal peak pressure, UES maximum admittance, intrabolus pressure (among others); EMG: duration of muscle activity (among others).</description>
