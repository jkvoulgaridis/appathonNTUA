  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to evaluate whether or not there is a substantial
      pharmacokinetic interaction between diclofenac and tramadol in a new formulation of a
      fixed-dose combination of diclofenac 25 milligrams (mg) and tramadol 25 mg for oral
      administration. The study was conducted in healthy participants of both genders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening period of about 2 weeks, 36 eligible healthy men and women were randomly
      allocated to receive 3 sequential treatments in the following order:

        -  a single dose of diclofenac followed by a single dose of the fixed-dose combination of
           diclofenac/tramadol followed by a single dose of tramadol

        -  a single dose of tramadol followed by a single dose of the fixed-dose combination of
           diclofenac/tramadol followed by a single dose of diclofenac.

      There were washout periods of 7 days between treatments.

      Sixteen blood samples were collected per participant: at pre-dose and 0.16, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75,
      1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 36 hours after administration of each of the study
      drugs.

      The pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailabilities of diclofenac and tramadol (and
      of the tramadol metabolite M1) were determined for the new fixed-dose combination product and
      were compared to the single compound reference products.

      Furthermore, the safety (frequency of adverse events) and tolerability of the new fixed-dose
      combination of diclofenac 25 mg and 25 mg tramadol in healthy men and women was assessed.

          -  Recent exposure to the study drug between the 30 days prior or any other medication by
             prescription or self consumed between the 14 days prior to the start of the study, or

          -  Surgery during the 30 days prior to the start of the study.

          -  Suspicion or evidence of infection by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV).

          -  Serologic test for syphilis (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test) positive.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any medication.

          -  Blood donation equal to or above 1 unit (0.5 liters) during the 30 days prior to the

             through the signing of an informed consent, or is not willing to follow the
             indications and/or restrictions of the protocol and rules of the procedure.

          -  The participant is vulnerable or potentially vulnerable by which cannot freely express
