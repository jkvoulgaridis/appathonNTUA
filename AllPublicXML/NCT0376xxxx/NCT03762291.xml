  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma patients will receive a cancer vaccine, called TXSVN that has been derived
      from the bacteria Salmonella. TXSVN is a weakened form of a live vaccine strain of the
      Salmonella bacteria (also known as the CVD908ssb strain) that has been genetically modified
      in the laboratory to produce a protein known as Survivin that stimulates an immune response
      in the body to the Survivin tumor antigen. CVD908ssb has been administered to over 80 healthy
      donors as a Salmonella vaccine in reported clinical trials. This trial intends to explore
      administration of this vaccine at a lower dose than what was tested in healthy individuals.

      Survivin belongs to the group of proteins known as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These
      are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell. They either are not found or are
      found in low levels normal cells in the human body. More than 90% of myeloma cancer cells
      have been shown to possess large quantities of Survivin.

      TXSVN may activate the immune system which is your body's ability to fight disease, and help
      develop a response against cancer cells that express Survivin. Survivin has been safely
      targeted using immune cells, drugs or direct inhibitors in over 50 patients with cancers in
      published reports.

      TXSVN, the modified strain of CVD908ssb has not been tested in humans to this date. TXSVN is
      an investigational product not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of TXSVN, to learn what the
      sideeffects are, and to see whether this therapy might help participants with multiple
      myeloma.

      The vaccine will be administered orally (by mouth) as a solution mixed with sodium
      bicarbonate. Participants may be pre-treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine
      (Benadryl). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are given to prevent a
      possible allergic reaction to the vaccine. Participants will remain in the clinic for three
      hours after receiving the vaccine for monitoring.Two doses of TXSVN will be given two weeks
      apart. Participants disease will be assessed pre-treatment and then 6 weeks after the second
      treatment. All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at
      Houston Methodist Hospital.

      In between the first and second treatments, and for 6 weeks after the last treatment, the
      investigators ask that participants not receive any other anti-cancer treatments such as
      radiation therapy or chemotherapy. If participants do receive any other therapies in-between
      the first and second treatment, then they will be taken off treatment and will not be able to
      receive the second treatment of cells.

      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started
      on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of TXSVN. Once that dose schedule proves safe,
      the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until
      all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered
      or the TXSVN administrations will be stopped.

      Before being treated, participants will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam.

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.

        -  Measurement of participants multiple myeloma by blood tests and bone marrow biopsy (when
           available).

        -  Measurements of participants tumor by routine imaging studies. The investigators will
           use the imaging study that was used before to follow the participants tumor:
           Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission
           Tomography (PET/CT), skeletal bone survey. These studies will be done on a case-by-case
           basis at the discretion of the participants treating physician.

        -  Pregnancy test (using a blood sample) if the participants is a female who can have
           children.

        -  Blood and stool cultures to ensure no ongoing infection at the time of vaccine
           administration.

      Participants will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the vaccine and after:

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function.

        -  Blood and stool cultures at 4 days after getting the vaccine an d at least weekly for up
           to 8 weeks after treatment, to monitor shedding of the administered live vaccine.

        -  Measurement of the participants multiple myeloma by blood tests and/or bone marrow
           biopsy (when available). Imaging study (as decided by the participants treating
           physician) 8 weeks after the 1st vaccination.

      To learn more about the way the vaccine is working in the participants body, an extra 20-40
      mL (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each vaccination, and weekly for eight (8)
      weeks after the participants first vaccination.

      Study Duration: The participants active participation in this study will last for
      approximately one (1) year. The investigators will then contact the participants once a year
      for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) in order to evaluate the
      participants disease response long-term. While participants are being followed on study,
      investigators will collect information about the response to the vaccine (how well or not the
      participants multiple myeloma responds to the treatment) and any toxicities the participants
      may experience. This study will continue until it has completed enrolling subjects and all
      subjects have completed follow-up or have come off study.
