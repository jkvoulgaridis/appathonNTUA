      This study evaluates the effect of citric acid on bone surface of infrabony defects when used
      for 30 seconds at ph 1 and 50% concentration before the application of bovine derived
      xenograft to fill the defect, Bone Morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) marker was evaluated in 5
      different days during the first month after surgery and clinical and radiographic parameters
      were reassessed after 6 months

    <textblock>
      Citric acid have been widely used to treat root surfaces of periodontally affected teeth in
      order to render it biologically suitable for fibroblast reattachment. however, systematic
      reviews showed no clinical significance when it was used as a root surface conditioner.
      Recently it was found in experimental studies that when citric acid was used on bone surface
      for a brief period, it increased bone formation and improved consolidation of grafted bone to
      bone bed. In this study infrabony defects were treated with citric acid PH 1 and 50%
      concentration for 30 seconds before washing it off and then application of bovine derived
      xenograft was done to fill the defect. BMP-2 marker was evaluated at days 1,3,7,14 and 30 by
      taking a sample using perio-paper from the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and clinical and
      radiographic parameters were taken after 6 months of follow-up
