  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      Multiple Myeloma,however, a subset of patients relapse due to the loss of target in tumor
      cells.Dual Specificity CD38 and BCMA CAR-T cells can recognize and kill the malignant cells
      through recognition of CD38 or BCMA. This is a phase 1/2 study designed to determine the
      safety of dual specificity CD38 and BCMA CAR-T cells and the feasibility of making enough to
      treat patients with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma.

      1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of dual specificity CD38 and BCMA CAR-T
                cells in patients with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma.

             2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells,
                and the phenotype of persisting T cells.Real Time polymerase chain receptor
                (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM and lymph node will be used to
                detect and quantify survival of universal dual specificity CD38 and BCMA CAR-T
                cells over time.

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      1.For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to dual specificity
      CD38 and BCMA CAR-T cell infusions.

      2.The CAR-T cells will be administered by i.v. injection over 20-30 minutes as a using Day 0:
      1-5x10e6/kg total dose on day 0.
