  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 88 million children drop out of primary school each year worldwide, and the
      highest number of dropouts are in the first and second grade. A proven strategy to reduce
      dropout from primary school is participation in early childhood care and education (ECCE)
      services that bolster young children's health, development and readiness for school. Access
      to quality ECCE services remains highly limited in Pakistan: less than 50% of four-year-olds
      are estimated to attend ECCE services, and skilled ECCE workers remain scarce.

      To address these challenges, LEAPS (Youth Leaders for Early Childhood Assuring Children are
      Prepared for School) was developed as a cross-generational strategy to support the learning
      and development of young children (3.5- to 5-year-olds) and female youth (18- to
      24-year-olds). The program provides vocational training to female youth, referred to as
      Community Youth Leaders (CYLs), to deliver a community-based preschool program in rural
      Sindh, Pakistan. The LEAPS program was previously developed in partnership with Pakistan's
      National Commission for Human Development (NCHD), a government entity charged with supporting
      community health, education, and vocational training programs. Efficacy and feasibility of
      the LEAPS strategy were demonstrated through a prior pilot evaluated in a cluster-randomized
      controlled trial in 2015 (NCT02645162).

      The NCHD is now seeking to integrate the LEAPS program within their full suite of services
      and to scale the program across 99 villages in rural Sindh under the technical guidance and
      support of a local implementation support team led by the Aga Khan University. This
      intervention utilizes two strategies: i) the first is the implementation of the LEAPS
      program, led by NCHD; and ii) the second is the technical support of the NCHD, to ensure the
      system is able to support program expansion and sustainability.

      This study uses a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design with three steps to assess program
      impact on school readiness and child and youth development outcomes across the 99 villages
      (&quot;clusters&quot;). All clusters will begin in the control state (i.e. access to standard community
      services). Prior to the start of the trial, clusters will be randomized to 'cross-over' to
      the intervention state (i.e. introduction of the LEAPS-NCHD program) during one of three
      sequential steps. Each step will be 8-9 months. By the end of the trial, all clusters will
      have been exposed to the intervention. Measurement is assessed across all clusters at each
      step. The total duration of the trial will be 26 months. A process evaluation will also be
      conducted to examine the large-scale implementation of the LEAPS-NCHD Program.

    <intervention_model_description>This study uses a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design with three steps to evaluate the impact of LEAPS-NCHD program. Ninety-nine clusters (villages) are enrolled. Thirty-three clusters per step are randomly selected to cross-over from receipt of standard services (comparison) to receipt of the LEAPS-NCHD program (intervention). Unit of randomization is at the village (cluster) level. A process evaluation will assess program rollout for fidelity, adherence, quality, and cost.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>School readiness of children aged 54 - 66 months assessed using the International Development &amp; Early Learning Assessment (IDELA). IDELA includes domains for emergent math (0-30 points), socio-emotional development (0-26 points), self-regulation (0-4 points), emergent literacy (0-39 points), fine motor skills (0-17 points), and gross motor skills (0-10 points). Domain scores are summed to generate an overall total score for school readiness (0-126 points). Higher scores reflect better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Child executive functioning skills: working memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>Direct assessment examining working memory capacity among children aged 54 - 66 months using the Corsi Block-tapping Test (Noel, 2009). The child's score reflects the longest sequence for which two block series were repeated correctly, plus 0.5 if one longer series was also correctly processed (range: 0 - 5 points). Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Child general executive functioning skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Head Toes Knees Shoulders task (Ponitz et al., 2008) will be used to assess general executive functioning skills among children aged 54 - 66 months. The assessment contains two sections, part one being easier and part two more challenging. Child participants may receive 0 to 20 points for each section. Scores will be presented separately for each section. Higher scores reflect better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Child executive functioning skills: cognitive flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>Direct assessment of cognitive flexibility skills among children aged 54 - 66 months, using the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) (Carlson, 2005). Participants are requested to sort cards at 3 levels. In the &quot;separated&quot; level, the cards depict a black silhouette shape (e.g., rabbit or boat) on a colored card. Thus, the shape and color dimensions are separated. In the &quot;integrated&quot; level, the shape and color are integrated on the card (i.e., red rabbit and blue boat). During &quot;switch trials,&quot; participants must change the dimension being matched. In the &quot;border&quot; level, the integrated pictures from the previous level are used, but half of the cards have borders. Five subscores will be examined: Total number correct trials on the separated level, pre- and post-switch (0-6 points each); total number correct trials on the integrated level, pre- and post-switch (0-6 points each); and total correct on the border version (0-12 points). Higher scores reflect better outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>Direct assessment to examine working memory skills of youth using the Backward Word Span task (Davis et al., 1995). The participant's score reflects the longest sequence for which two series were repeated correctly, plus 0.5 if one longer series was also correctly processed (range: 0 - 7 points). Higher scores reflect better outcomes.</description>

A score will be awarded for each test, reflecting the longest sequence for which two series were repeated correctly, plus 0.5 if one longer series was also correctly processed (range for each: 0-8 points). Higher scores reflect better outcomes.</description>
