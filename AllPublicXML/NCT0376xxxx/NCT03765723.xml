      This study aims to predict risk factors of acute postoperative pain of the patients
      undergoing Total Knee Replacement Arthroplasty(TKRA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing bilateral TKRA are recruited. The time interval between the surgery of
      each leg is within 2 weeks. Before each surgery, patients will be asked to conduct
      questionnaires of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) and Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale(PCS). In addition, the patients will have their preoperative knee pain(measured by Knee
      injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), preoperative pain in other sites, expectation of
      postoperative pain(measured by Numerical Rating Scale), and morbidity of diabetic neuropathy
      recorded. Demographic factors including age, sex, and BMI of patients will be collected.
      Twenty four and forty eight hours after completion of the surgery, each patient will be asked
      to report thier acute postoperative pain on Numerical Rating Scale.

      This study aims to find out risk factors of acute postoperative pain, including identical
      surgical history within 2 weeks, in patients undergoing bilateral TKRA.

    <measure>Preoperative anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>one day before the surgery: 20 hours before the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Before undergoing TKRA of each leg, patients' preoperative anxiety and depression is recorded on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) total score.
HADS is an instrument for screening for clinically significant anxiety and depression in patients attending a general medical clinic. The scale consists of two subscales: anxiety subscale and depression subscale. Each subscale has seven items and each items are answered by the patient on a four point(0-3) response categories so the possible score ranges from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression(summation). A score of 0 to 7 for either subscale could be regarded as being in normal range, a score of 8-10 being suggestive of the presence of the mood disorder, and a score of 11 or higher indicating probable presence of the respective state.</description>

    <measure>Pain catastrophizing level</measure>
    <time_frame>one day before the surgery: 20 hours before the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Before undergoing TKRA of each leg, patients' pain catastrophizing level is recorded on Pain Catastrophizing Scale(PCS) total score.
PCS is a thirteen-item instrument to assess patient's catastrophizing on pain experience. The scale consists of three subscales: rumination(4 items), magnification(3 items), and helplessness(4 items). For each items, patients are asked to response on a five point(0-4) categories so the total score is ranging from 0 to 52(summation). A total PCS score of 30 is considered cut-off scores for clinically relevant levels of catastrophizing. The higher score represents high level of catastrophizing.</description>

    <measure>Preoperative knee pain</measure>
    <time_frame>one day before the surgery: 20 hours before the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Before undergoing TKRA of each leg, patients' preoperative knee pain is recorded on Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score(KOOS) pain subscale score.
KOOS is an instrument to assess pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee related quality of life of the patients with ligament injury, meniscus injury, or post traumatic osteoarthritis. A pain subscale of KOOS consists of nine items to assess the level of pain in knee, each item being scored from 0 to 4. A total score of pain subscale ranges from 0 to 36(summation). In this raw scale score on pain, the higher score means the higher level of pain.</description>
