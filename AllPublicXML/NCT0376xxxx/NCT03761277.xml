  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, post market study to evaluate Intrathecal (IT)
      preservative-free morphine sulfate (PFMS) using the SynchroMed™ II infusion system as an
      alternative to systemic opioids for the treatment of chronic, intractable, non-malignant
      primary back pain with or without leg pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be assessed for pain control and opioid-related side effects following a route
      of delivery change from systemic opioids to IT morphine therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Success at the 6-Month Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-Month Visit</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the proportion of subjects with Clinical Success at the 6-Month Visit. Clinical Success is defined as any of the following: 1) Reduced opioid-related side effects with equal pain 2) Reduced pain with equal opioid-related side effects 3) Reduced pain and reduced opioid-related side effects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Intensity at the 6-Month Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-Month Visit</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate pain intensity scores (VAS) at the 6-Month Visit is non-inferior to VAS at Baseline. Pain will be assessed using VAS. The VAS is a 100mm line, with &quot;No pain&quot; on the left side of the line and &quot;Worst pain imaginable&quot; on the right side of the line. Subjects will be asked to make a perpendicular mark on the VAS line that best describes their average pain in the last 24 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Opioid Side Effect (NOSE) Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-Month Visit</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the change in opioid-related side effects scores (NOSE) from Baseline to the 6-Month Visit. The Numerical Opioid Side Effect (NOSE) Assessment Tool is a tool to evaluate 10 opioid-related side effects using a 11-point numerical scale. Subjects are asked to evaluate each of the 10 opioid-related side effects on a scale of 0 - 10 with 0 being &quot;not present&quot; and 10 being &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot;. A total sum score can range from 0 - 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic Opioid Elimination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6-Month Visit</time_frame>
