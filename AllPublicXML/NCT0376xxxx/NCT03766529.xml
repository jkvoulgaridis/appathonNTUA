    <textblock>
      Myocardial protection is of crucial importance for surgical coronary revascularization in
      patients with ischaemic heart diseases. The investigators proposed loop isolation-based
      uploading preconditioning to protect heart from ischemic-reperfusion damage (LiuPhD) as a
      novel cardioprotective strategy, and applied to patients who underwent on-pump coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG).

    <textblock>
      Myocardial protection is of crucial importance for surgical coronary revascularization in
      patients with ischaemic heart diseases. Considerable effort has been made to optimize
      cardioprotective strategy for improving cardiac performances after global myocardial
      ischemia. Of various strategies, terminal warm blood cardioplegia (TWBC) delivery has been
      proven to be effective in reducing risk of ischemic attack at the time of myocardial
      reperfusion. Based on TWBC strategy and Frank-Starling law of heart, the investigators
      proposed loop isolation-based uploading preconditioning to protect heart from
      ischemic-reperfusion damage (LiuPhD) as a novel myocardial protective strategy, which
      procedurally renders coronary loop via brief warm blood delivery independent of
      extracorporeal loop following TWBC delivery just before declamping. The investigators
      hypothesize that LiuPhD strategy allows myocardial cells complete depolarization and drives
      heart into zero-loading heat cycles, contributing to enhancing myocardial physiologic reserve
      and improving cardiac initiative capacity responding to upcoming loading increases after
      onset of clamp release. The aim of the present study was to determine whether LiuPhD strategy
      during on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can attenuate reperfusion injury after
      global myocardial ischemia.

        The LiuPhD (Loop Isolation-based Uploading Preconditioning to Protect Heart from
        ischemic-reperfusion Damage) study was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, first-in-man
        trial on the use of LiuPhD strategy for myocardial protection in patients who underwent
        surgical coronary revascularization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients scheduled for a first, elective, isolated, open thoracotomy, on-pump CABG
             were eligible for enrollment if they if they had coronary angiography-confirmed
             unprotected left main disease, 3-vessel disease with or without proximal LAD artery
             disease, or 2-vessel disease with proximal LAD artery disease.
