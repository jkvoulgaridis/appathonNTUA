  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD). The investigators hypothesize that
      participants receiving app-CBT will have greater reduction in LSAS scores than those in the
      waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 12).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to test the efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment
      for adults with SAD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects (N=80) will be randomly assigned
      to 12 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for SAD either immediately, or after a 12-week long
      waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT
      for SAD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with SAD, and that it will lead to
      greater reductions in SAD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist
      control).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in SAD severity (LSAS) at the end of treatment/waitlist period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a clinician-administered measure of social anxiety symptom severity. It contains 24 social situations likely to elicit social anxiety, and items are scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate more severe SAD symptoms. The LSAS will be used to assess change in social anxiety symptoms from baseline to endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in depression at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on depression (QIDS-SR). The QIDS-SR is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms consisting of 16 scale items with responses ranging from 0 to 3, including one suicide item (item #12). Higher scores correspond with greater depression severity, and the measure is a well-validated, sensitive measure of symptom severity in depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on functional impairment (SDS). The SDS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on quality of life, assessed using The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>

    <description>12-week Smartphone-delivered CBT for SAD. In-person cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for SAD. The app-delivered CBT in this project includes modules such as cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, core belief work), behavioral skills (e.g., exposure with ritual prevention), and perceptual retraining/mindfulness skills.</description>
