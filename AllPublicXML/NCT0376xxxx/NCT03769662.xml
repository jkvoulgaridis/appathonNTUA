      XT-150-1-0201 Extension: Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of XT-150 for the
      Treatment of Osteoarthritic Pain.

      Participants in this study will have been enrolled in the 0201 study and qualify for an
      intra-articular injection of XT-150 into the osteoarthritic knee.

      The study will assess XT-150 safety, tolerability, and efficacy in participants who received
      placebo in the 0201 study, or have a second qualifying knee, or a second injection into the
      same knee that was treated in 0201.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Qualified and participated in clinical study XT-150-1-0201.

               1. Participant was assigned to placebo, or

               2. Participant elects to have XT-150 administered to the XT-150-untreated knee that
                  qualified under XT-150-1-0201 criteria, or

               3. Participant had inadequate pain relief and elects to receive a second injection
                  to the same knee treated on clinical study XT-150-1-0201

          2. Sufficiently severe OA of knee to require/have recommended knee replacement surgery or
             be unsuitable for knee replacement surgery based on co-morbidities or orthopedic
             considerations; be free of local or intra-articular infection.

          3. Symptomatic disease because of osteoarthritis, defined as a Verbal Numerical Rating
             Scale (VNRS) scores of a worst pain of at least 7 at any time during the preceding
             week (based on scale of 0 to 10, with 10 representing &quot;pain as bad as you can
             imagine&quot;).

          4. Stable analgesic regimen during the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          5. Inadequate pain relief (minimum ≥ 5 mean on Brief Pain Inventory-Severity Scale)
             lasting more than 3 months.

          6. In the judgment of the Investigator, acceptable general medical condition

          7. Life expectancy &gt;6 months

          8. Male participants who are heterosexually active and not surgically sterile must agree

             and for 3 months after the study is completed.

          9. Have suitable knee joint anatomy for intra-articular injection

         10. Willing and able to return for the follow-up (FU) visits

             replacement appointment within 4 months of study treatment

          3. History of rheumatoid arthritis of the knee or gout.

          4. High peri-operative risks which in the judgment of the investigator preclude a safe

          9. Severe anemia (Grade 3; hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL, &lt;4.9 mmol/L, &lt;80 g/L; transfusion
