  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unplanned readmissions after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are among
      the leading causes of preventable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Digital health
      interventions (DHI) could be an effective tool in promoting self-management, adherence to
      guideline directed therapy, and cardiovascular risk reduction.

      A DHI developed at Johns Hopkins—the Corrie Health Digital Platform—includes the first
      cardiology Apple CareKit smartphone application, paired with an Apple Watch and iHealth
      Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff. Corrie targets: (1) self-management of cardiac
      medications, (2) self-tracking of vital signs, (3) education about cardiovascular disease
      through articles and animated videos, and (4) care coordination that includes outpatient
      follow-up appointments.

      In this prospective study, STEMI or type 1 NSTEMI patients are being enrolled to use the
      Corrie Digital Health Platform beginning early during participants' hospital stay. Enrollment
      sites include Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Massachusetts
      General Hospital, and Reading Hospital. The primary objective is to compare time to first
      readmission within 30 days post-discharge among patients with the Corrie Digital Health
      Platform to patients in the historical standard of care comparison group.
