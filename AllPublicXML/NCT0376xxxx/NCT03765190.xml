      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on subjects and
      their cancer using proton radiation therapy in combination with immunotherapy(ie. Programmed
      cell death protein 1, also known as PD-1 antibody) in multiple metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As is known to all, the main treatment method for metastatic tumors is systemic chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy is merely for the purpose of palliative treatment. Recent studies have shown
      that tumors with no more than 5 metastatic sites can still achieve satisfactory overall
      survival by local treatments such as radiotherapy. However, for tumors with more metastatic
      lesions, side effect is pretty high for photon radiotherapy due to the wide range of
      irradiation. Protons might be a safe treatment means for multiple metastases cancer because
      of the Brag peak, when the normal tissue dose can be significantly reduced. Combination of
      proton therapy with immunotherapy can be a research direction for multiple metastatic tumors.
      This study intends to observe the safety and efficacy of proton technique combined with
      immunotherapy in improving the overall anti- tumor effect for metastatic tumors.
