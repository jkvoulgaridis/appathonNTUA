  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind within-subject study to estimate observed application site adverse events
      following topical applications of crisaborole and vehicle in healthy participants

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To further understand the potential for crisaborole to evoke skin irritancy, a within-subject
      comparison study, C3291042 will assess the local tolerability of crisaborole 5 mg/cm² in
      healthy participants, who have had baseline assessments of surrogate markers of skin
      sensitivity—i.e. current perception threshold (CPT) measurements and standardized lactic acid
      stinging test (LAST) assessments. To further the clinical understanding of application site
      pain, responses to crisaborole ointment compared to crisaborole vehicle ointment will be
      assessed in comparisons based upon CPT (low versus high; symmetry versus asymmetry) and
      response to LAST (&quot;stingers&quot; versus &quot;non-stingers&quot;). This exploration of skin sensitivity
      characterizations in healthy participants exposed to crisaborole 5 mg/cm² will assess
      application site burning, stinging, and pain as well as other application site
      characteristics selected from a MedDRA-based list of terms by the participants. More advanced
      understanding of baseline application site sensation in healthy participants prior to higher
      local application rate of topical crisaborole may provide strategies for topical dermatologic
      product development programs striving to prevent or minimize application site sensory adverse
      events.

    <masking_description>Crisaborole 2% ointment and matching crisaborole vehicle will be supplied by Pfizer to the CRU as packaged 60 gram tubes and labeled according to local regulatory requirements in an unblinded fashion.
Crisaborole and vehicle ointment doses for the 14 pre-specified application sites bilaterally will be prepared by the unblinded PCRU pharmacist and provided to the blinded investigational site staff in individual dose containers. Subjects will be blinded to side of body treated with crisaborole and side of body treated with vehicle.</masking_description>
