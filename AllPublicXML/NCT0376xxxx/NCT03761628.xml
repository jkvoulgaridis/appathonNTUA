  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-armed, multi-center study to evaluate clinical performance,
      tolerability, and safety of Gedea Pessary in 24 adult women with VVC. On Day 0, patients will
      have gynecological examination, vaginal samples taken, and will receive the investigational
      product to be self-administered. Patients will be examined after 7 days with respect to VVC
      signs and symptoms and if not cured, will receive prolonged treatment for one additional
      week. Patients will be followed-up by telephone up to 29 days after last treatment. Vaginal
      samples will be used for confirming diagnosis and microbiome analyzes. Patient questionnaires
      will be used for assessing VVC symptoms, usability, and adverse events (AEs).

    <description>Defined as the absence of signs and symptoms of VVC in terms of having a composite vulvovaginal signs-and-symptoms (CVVS) score equal to or below 3.
Each of the following 6 vulvovaginal signs and symptoms will be individually scored using the scoring scale below and then added together to determine the CVVS score.
Vulvovaginal signs: erythema, edema, or excoriation
Vulvovaginal symptoms: itching, burning, or irritation
Scoring Scale: each score should be objectively defined. 0 = none (absent)
= mild (slight)
= moderate (definitely present)
= severe (marked, intense)</description>
