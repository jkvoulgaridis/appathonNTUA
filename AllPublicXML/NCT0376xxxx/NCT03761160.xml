      This research study seeks to develop and evaluate a mobile health app which aims to provide
      patients who are about to initiate androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer with an
      exercise program and better eating habits. The first phase of the research study seeks to
      evaluate the experience of the first version of the mobile health app within a group of
      participants and what they think of it.

      The investigators are interested in how individuals react to the use of a developed mobile
      health app and what they think of it.

    <description>The developed mobile health app will include the following facets:
Physical activities
Dietary regimen.
The physical activities facet will encourage patients to engage in physical activities, with daily prompts, encouragement, and tips.
Users will be asked to record the type of physical activity they engaged in during the week, and for how long.
The dietary aspect will ask patients to log what they ate during the day and to rate how 'healthy' it is</description>
