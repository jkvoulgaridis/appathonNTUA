  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aorta Abdominal aneurism (AAA) is a chronic degenerative disorder leading to the dilation and
      eventually to the rupture of the aortic wall. The pathology presents risk factors such as
      aging, atherosclerosis, male gender, cigarette smoking, pulmonary emphysema and high blood
      pressure.The vascular wall destruction is characterized by a remodeling of the extracellular
      matrix (ECM), the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate of macrophages and lymphocytes
      associated increase in production of MMPs. A similar destruction mechanisms is found in
      periodontitis a chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by gram-negative bacteria species
      that are able to degrade ECM of the tooth supporting tissues and leading finally to tooth
      loss .Moreover, relationships between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease have already
      been demonstrated. These associations are considered to be initiated by transient or
      prolonged bacteremia due to dissemination of oral bacteria or their products into the
      bloodstream . The periopathogens, more specifically Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), were
      observed in atherosclerosis and aneurysm specimens as well as in coronary heart disease and
      endocarditis The association between periodontitis and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) has
      not often been studied especially from a clinical aspect. The mechanisms that induce the
      initiation, the development or the recurrence and the rupture of AAA after a period of
      quiescence not well studied and are therefore still unknown.

      The aim of this clinical observational case controlled study is to search for a possible
      relationship between periodontal disease and rapid growth of AAA. Patients presenting stable
      or unstable AAA will be screened for the degree of periodontitis, for the type of oral
      microbiology and periodontopathogen markers present in the blood stream.

      31 consecutive dentulous patients diagnosed for AAA requiring a cardiovascular surgery
      (instable AAA) and 31 consecutive dentulous patients with stable AAA (no need for
      cardiovascular surgery) will be recruited from the Cardiovascular Surgery Department of the
      University Hospital of Liège (Faculty of Medicine, University of Liège, Belgium - Pr. N.
      Sakalihasan). The 62 patients will be subjected to:

        1. Full clinical periodontal parameter assessment

        2. Microbiological analyses of saliva,

        3. Supra- and sub- gingival microbiological test

        4. Blood test for biomarker analysis.

        5. Imaging (echography, CT-Scans)measurments

        Patients from the Cardiovascular Surgery Department, University Hospital of Liège (Belgium)
