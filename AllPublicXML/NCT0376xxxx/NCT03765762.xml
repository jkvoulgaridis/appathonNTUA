  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and potential cognitive benefit of GRF6019, a human plasma protein fraction.
      GRF6019 or placebo will be administered intravenously to subjects with severe Alzheimer's
      disease every day for 5 consecutive days. The total study duration for each subject is
      approximately 9 weeks.

    <measure>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in the MMSE score. The MMSE is a 30-point questionnaire used to measure the extent of cognitive impairment. Lower scores indicate more severe cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in the SIB score. The SIB assesses cognition; test questions measure orientation, attention, language, praxis, visuospatial perception, construction, memory, orientation to name, and social interaction. There are 57 items and the range of possible scores is 0-133. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group Activities of Daily Living Inventory for Severe Alzheimer's Disease (ADCS-ADL-Severe)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in the ADCS-ADL-Severe score. The ADCS-ADL-Severe contains 19 items covering physical and mental functioning and independence in self-care and assesses the competence in performing basic activities of daily living. The scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating less functional impairment.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (ADCS-CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in the ADCS-CGIC score. A CGIC score is based on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial.The ADCS-CGIC is a rating of change and not of severity. It provides a semi structured format to enable clinicians to gather necessary clinical information from both the patient and informant to make a global impression of change. After completing the interviews, the clinician records the clinical impression of change on a 7-point Likert-type scale (from marked improvement to marked worsening).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home (NPI-NH) Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline in the NPI-NH score. NPI-NH consists of 12 behavioral domains and is to assess psychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia in outpatient settings. For each behavioral domain, there are 4 scores: frequency (1-4), severity (1-3), domain total score (frequency x severity), and occupational disruptiveness (0-5), with lower scores indicating fewer symptoms. Thus, the NPI-NH evaluates response to therapy and provides symptom severity and distress ratings for each symptom reported, as well as total severity and distress scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Caregiver version</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NPI is designed to measure the neuropsychiatric symptoms and psychopathology of patients with Alzheimer's Disease when the patient is living with a caregiver. NPI is based on responses from the informed caregiver during an interview. It consists of 12 sub-domains. A screening question is asked about each sub-domain. If the response is yes, indicating the patient has problems with a particular sub-domain of behavior, the caregiver is only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, their severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptom causes them on a 5-point scale. The NPI provides symptom frequency, severity and distress ratings for each symptom reported, and total scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores. Lower scores indicate better neuropsychiatric state of a subject.</description>
