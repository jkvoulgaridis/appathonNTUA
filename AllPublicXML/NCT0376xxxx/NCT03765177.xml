  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an early phase study defined as a phase I/II trial assessing
      safety, feasibility and efficacy of CLIC-1901 autologous anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor
      T cells (CAR-T) cells for participants with relapsed/refractory CD19 positive (CD19+) Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The Initial Stage of the study
      (n=20 participants) will focus on feasibility and safety while the Extended Stage will
      include all participants enrolled in the study (n=additional 40 participants for a total of
      60) and will focus on efficacy and safety outcomes. In the proposed trial, we will administer
      our CAR-T cell product to these participants as a single infusion. Participants will undergo
      (a) lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by (b) infusion of
      autologous CLIC-1901 CAR-T cells. All treatments will be delivered intravenously.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a two-stage, single-arm, open-label early phase study to
      determine the safety and efficacy of CLIC-1901 cell therapy in patients with CD19+ ALL and
      NHL. The primary objective in the initial stage of 20 participants will be to evaluate the
      feasibility of our protocol and the safety and tolerability of infusing autologous CLIC-1901
      cells into patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ ALL or NHL. Once 20 participants have been
      treated and the treatment is deemed safe, up to 40 more participants will be enrolled in an
      extension stage where the primary objective will be overall response rate (defined as
      complete or partial response) at 6 months after CLIC-1901 infusion.
