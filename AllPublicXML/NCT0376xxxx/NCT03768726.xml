  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 26-week open-label extension study is designed to provide information on the safety and
      tolerability of oral ziprasidone (20-80 mg BID (twice daily) with meals) during long-term
      administration in children and adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder (current or most recent
      episode manic).

      Study A1281201 is a 6 month, open label extension study of the ongoing double blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled study of ziprasidone in pediatric Bipolar Disorder (Study
      A1281198). Study A1281201 will enroll adolescents aged 10 to 17 years with Bipolar I Disorder
      who have participated in double blind Study A1281198. In order to be enrolled in this open
      label extension trial, subjects must have met the enrollment criteria for Study A1281198, and
      must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for Study A1281201 at the extension study
      Baseline visit (last visit in the double blind study).

      The purpose of adding this extension study to the ongoing Geodon pediatric bipolar program is
      to obtain additional longer term safety data in children and adolescents with Bipolar I
      disorder treated with ziprasidone.

             visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          -  The subjects must have received investigational product in Study A1281198 and
             completed at least 3 weeks of double blind treatment before entering this open label
             extension.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be likely to benefit from
             antipsychotic therapy .

             effective method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any subjects from the preceding double blind trail who experienced a serious adverse
             event which required study medication to be discontinued and the subject to be
             withdrawn from the study. Subjects who experienced cardiac arrhythmias, conduction
             abnormalities, or QTc prolongation (confirmed and persistent Fridericia's correction
             (QTcF) &gt;480 msec or increase from baseline QTcF &gt;60 msec) during the preceding study.

          -  Subjects requiring any medications not allowed by the Concomitant Medication Table 12
             (see &quot;Concomitant Treatment(s)&quot;).

          -  Subjects who require treatment with drugs that are known to consistently prolong the
             QT interval (see Concomitant Medication Table 12).

          -  Subjects who are judged by the investigator as being at imminent risk of suicide.

          -  Subjects living in the same home as another study participant or having the same
             caregiver during the same enrollment period (Such subjects can be enrolled in the
             study at different times but may not be in the study at the same time).

          -  Subjects should be excluded or a risk assessment should be done to verify that it is
             safe for the subject to participate in the trial if the subject's responses on the C
             SSRS or other information based on the investigator's judgment indicate:

               -  Suicide ideation associated with actual intent and a method or plan such that a
                  positive response ('Yes') is made on items 4 or 5 of the suicidal ideation
                  subscale of the C SSRS; or

               -  Any suicide behaviors such that a determination of 'yes' is made to any of the
                  suicide behavior items of the C SSRS.

          -  Pregnant female subjects, breastfeeding female subjects.

          -  Participation in other studies other than the preceding Study.

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
