      To determine if there is any carry over difference with sensation training to the low back
      for patients with low back pain with the addition of a training at home. This will be looked
      at to see if there is a difference in pain or back / leg movement right after the training
      and in a few days after doing some exercises at home.

      In a previous case series patients with chronic Low Back Pain (LBP) who received tactile
      acuity training to their lower back in the absence of movement, experienced immediate
      positive changes in pain ratings and spinal movements. These changes, however, where only
      measured immediate post-intervention. This study aims to use a similar design of sensory
      discrimination for LBP, but will include a sensory discrimination home exercise program and
      compare groups at a follow-up visit for any difference between groups (48-96 hours) of the
      immediate changes. Changes will be assessed for pain and back and leg movement.
