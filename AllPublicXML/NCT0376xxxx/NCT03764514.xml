  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational based pilot study evaluating the use of spinal cord stimulators for
      the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy will lead to an increase in
      quality of life and decrease in pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer treatment, for many patients, results in painful side effects. As evidence mounts
      demonstrating the risks associated with long term opioid therapy, non-opioid modalities need
      to be developed. Spinal cord stimulators are implanted devices that modulate the pain
      signaling system in the spinal cord. This research hopes to determine if the use of a spinal
      cord stimulator in patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy will lead to an
      increase in quality of life and decrease in pain.The primary endpoints will be the number of
      patients who undergo permanent implantation. The endpoints will measure pain with the Brief
      Pain Inventory Short Form visual analog scale. The sleep quality will be measured using the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment.

    <measure>Subjective Pain Assessment: Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measure Pain with the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form. The scale measures the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. The scale range includes 0-10 scales, with 0=no interference and 10=interferes completely. There is not a scoring algorithm, but &quot;worst pain&quot; or the average of the four severity items can be used as measures of pain severity; the average of the seven interference items can be used as a measure of pain interference.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Quality of Life Assessment: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measure quality of life through the use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a 19-item, self-rated questionnaire designed to measure sleep quality and disturbance over the past month in clinical populations.The 19 items are grouped into 7 components, including (1) sleep duration, (2) sleep disturbance, (3) sleep latency, (4) daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness, (5) sleep efficiency, (6) overall sleep quality, and (7) sleep medication use. Each of the sleep components yields a score ranging from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating the greatest dysfunction. The sleep component scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (global score) indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
