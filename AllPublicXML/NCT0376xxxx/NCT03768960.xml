    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety profile of daratumumab in routine
      clinical practice when given as monotherapy in Indian participants with relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an
      immunomodulatory agent.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 (Cycle 1 to 5); Days 1 and 28 (Cycle 6) (each cycle of 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire containing both single and multi-item measures. These include five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Functioning), three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea/Vomiting), a Global Health Status/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (Constipation, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Dyspnea, Appetite Loss, and Financial Difficulties). The scores ranges from 0-100, a high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL represent better functioning ability or Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales and single items represents significant symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 (Cycle 1 to 5); Days 1 and 28 (Cycle 6) (each cycle of 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating &quot;health today&quot; with ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The responses to the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single utility score ranging from zero (0.0- worst health state) to 1 (1.0- better health state) representing the general health status of the individual.</description>

             HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]
             and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using
             real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded.
             exception: Participants with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination
             (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) and a known history of prior HBV
             vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR

          -  Known seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic
             response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral
