  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been very effective for patients who suffer from
      mild C diff infection (CDI) which recurs but it is unclear how effective FMT alone is in
      treating severe and fulminant CDI. Current evidence suggests that FMT in combination with
      vancomycin is required, and that multiple treatments are necessary. The investigators think
      fidaxomicin may be a better option in the context and may potentially reduce the number of
      FMT required. However, fidaxomicin has never been used to treat severe or fulminant CDI. In
      this pilot study, the investigators plan to use a combination of FMT plus fidaxomicin to
      determine efficacy and safety in treating patients with severe or fulminant CDI. The
      investigators want to see if this approach may reduce the number of FMT treatment required,
      and/or the length of hospital stay.

      In this prospective, open -label, multi--center feasibility study, the investigators aim to
      determine the efficacy and safety of using combined serial FMT by enema plus fidaxomicin to
      treat patients who have severe or fulminant CDI not responding to maximal medical therapy.
      The hypothesis is the combination of FMT plus fidaxomicin can reduce the number of FMT
      required and/or hospital length of stay compared to FMT plus vancomycin.

      Participants will receive FMT by enemas over 3 days which constitutes a single cycle with
      concurrent treatment with oral fidaxomicin. If participants do not show improvement
      biochemically or clinically, then a repeat FMT cycle will be administered to a maximum of 4
      cycles.
