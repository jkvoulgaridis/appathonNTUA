      This study explores the effects that medication can have on increasing pupil dilation. Pupil
      dilation size is important for operative eye procedures. Decreased pupil size is related to
      increased complication risks in eye surgery. By exploring novel pupil dilation techniques,
      there is a potential to counteract the effects of poor pupil dilation that is caused by
      medications such as alpha-blockers. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a syndrome
      characterized by a floppy iris (IFIS) and poor pupil dilation during surgery that is caused
      by BPH medications. This study evaluates treatment methods targeting IFIS.
