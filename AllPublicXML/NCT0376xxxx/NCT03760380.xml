      This study involves the use of a newly designed shoe device for knee arthritis patients that
      may help reduce knee pain and improve function. This is a 2-phase study designed to evaluate
      knee pain and function in healthy participants with a history of medial knee arthritis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate: 1. how using the shoe device will affect a person's
      walking gait and balance over a single day; and 2. how using the shoe device over the course
      of a 12-week period will affect a person's walking gait and balance.

    <description>Participants selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as one can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <description>Participants will serve as their own control. Questionnaires and gait measures will be collected during an initial visit using the experimental shoe device.

    <description>Participants will serve as their own control. Questionnaires, balance, functional and gait measures will be collected during four different visits over a twelve week period (once at baseline visit, 4, 8, and 12 week visits) using the experimental shoe device. Patients will also complete a home walking program using the shoe device over the twelve week period. Subjects will be assigned one of two shoes/soles (either Sole 1-Offset or Sole 2- Offset) for home use.</description>

    <description>Appropriately-designed, stimulatory - but not mechanically supportive -device to enhance control of balance, postural sway and key features of walking gait in arthritic knee patients. The gait-modifying shoes will initially be neutrally aligned to create the smallest amount of instability. This is defined as the location which creates the smallest amount of instability.</description>

The offset sole will be placed in a position that may reduce the knee adduction moment.
