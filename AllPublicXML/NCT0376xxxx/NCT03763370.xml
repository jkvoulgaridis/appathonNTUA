    <textblock>
      belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal immunoconjugate that binds
      specifically to B-Cell Maturation Antigen. This program is intended to provide access to
      belantamab mafodotin in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) and who are
      refractory to an anti-CD38 antibody (e.g. daratumumab) alone or in combination, and to an
      immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) (i.e., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and to a proteasome
      inhibitor (PI) (i.e., bortezomib, ixazomib or carfilzomib). Patients considering this access
      program should have no other therapeutic option, and not eligible for other clinical trials.

      Compassionate use program (209233): Additional Criteria: patients must have failed at least
      three lines of above stated prior therapy and should also be ineligible for all currently
      approved standard of care for 4L+ MM in the requesting country.

      The Expanded Access program (213304) is currently only available in the United States only.
      The Individual Patient program (209233) is available in countries other than the United
      States.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adequate organ system functions.

        Criteria for Determining Adequate Organ System Function:

        Lab Parameter -- Laboratory Values Absolute Neutrophil count -- (ANC) / ≥ 1.0 X 109/L
        Hemoglobin -- ≥ 7.0 g/dL Platelets -- ≥ 50 X 109/L Total bilirubin -- ≤1.5X ULN (Isolated
        bilirubin ≥1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)
        ALT -- ≤2.5 X ULN or &lt;5 times ULN if documented liver infiltration eGFR (as calculated MDRD
        equation) -- ≥ 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2

        Contraception:

          1. Female Participants: Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical
             studies.

             A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

               -  Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR

               -  Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a
                  failure rate of &lt;1% per year), preferably with low user dependency, during the
                  intervention period and for at least 80 days after the last dose of belantamab
                  mafodotin and agrees not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of
                  reproduction during this period. The physician should evaluate the effectiveness
                  of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of belantamab
                  mafodotin.

             A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test (as required by
             local regulations) within 72 hours before the first dose of belantamab mafodotin.

             The physician is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early
             undetected pregnancy.

          2. Male Participants: Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical
             studies.

        intervention period and for at least 140 days after last dose of belantamab mafodotin:

        • Refrain from donating sperm

        PLUS either:

        • Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle
        (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.

        OR

        • Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below: Agree to use a male condom and
        female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure
        rate of &lt;1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing
        potential who is not currently pregnant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of active bleeding requiring intervention within the last four weeks.

             condition that could affect participant's safety). Participants with isolated
             proteinuria resulting from MM are eligible, provided they fulfil criteria given in
             Inclusion #1.

          6. Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder or other
             conditions (including lab abnormalities) that could interfere with participant's

          7. Current unstable liver or biliary disease defined by the presence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices,
             persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis. Note: Stable chronic liver disease (including
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement of
             malignancy is acceptable if otherwise meets entry criteria.

          8. Malignancies other than disease under study are excluded, except for any other
             malignancy from which the participant is not being actively treated with cytotoxic
