    <intervention_model_description>This will be a modified 3+3 dose-escalation design with a primary endpoint of dose-limiting toxicity. All cohorts will receive the same dose of FOLFOX, once every 2 weeks. All cohorts will receive entinostat on days 1,8, 15, and 22 of 28 day cycles. Cohorts will vary in their dose of entinostat as follows:
Cohort 0: 2mg
Cohort 1: 3mg
Cohort 2: 4mg
Cohort 3: 5mg
Dosing will start with cohort 1. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed, the dose will be escalated directly to cohort 3. If any DLTs are experienced in cohort 1, three additional subjects will be enrolled in cohort 1. If no DLTs are experience by the additional subjects, the dose will be escalated to cohort 2. If a DLT occurs in two subjects in any dose cohort, dose escalation will be halted, and the next three subjects will be enrolled at the next lower dose cohort.</intervention_model_description>

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer or ductal
             carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent) or localized prostate
             cancer treated with curative intent and absence of PSA relapse or incidental prostate
             cancer (Gleason score ≤3 +4 and PSA &lt;10ng/L undergoing active surveillance and

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or clinical
             laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of
             a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of Entinostat or FOLFOX, may
             affect the interpretation of the results, render the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent.
