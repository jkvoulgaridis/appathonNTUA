  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation has been recommended in patients with
      ARDS and is currently used. in part because oxygenation is better and there is a lower risk
      of diaphragm dysfunction due to disuse. The other approach to minimizing lung injury from
      spontaneous effort is the use of neuromuscular blockade; an early and short term (48 hours)
      of neuromuscular blockade in patients with severe ARDS has been shown to decrease
      inflammation and to improve survival. The investigators propose a pilot study to test the
      feasibility and the physiological effects of allowing spontaneous breathing in the prone
      position in patients with ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multi-center feasibility study will enroll 12 adult ARDS patients from the Intensive Care
      Units (ICUs) in Japan and Peru. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient or legally
      authorized substitute decision maker. Moderate-to-severe ARDS patients who are planned to
      turn to prone positioning, based on the attending physician's decisions will be included.
      Prior to initiating the protocol, patients will be sedated deeply with sedatives and/or
      opioids. Ventilator settings, physiological data, esophageal pressure and diaphragm activity
      will be recorded and physiological measurements will be collected for 5 minutes in supine
      (Measurement 1: Supine + spontaneous effort) . Patients will be paralyzed with a continuous
      infusion of rocuronium, and Measurement 2 (Supine + paralysis) will be recorded. The critical
      care team in the ICU change the position from supine to prone. After waiting for at least 1
      hour in prone positioning, Measurement 3 (Prone + paralysis) will be recorded. Continuous
      infusion of rocuronium will be gradually decreased (and can be terminated) until spontaneous
      breathing will be observed without reaching an excessive level. The presence of spontaneous
      breathing will be evaluated by the negative swing of esophageal pressure, and Measurement 5
      (Prone + spontaneous breathing) will be recorded.
