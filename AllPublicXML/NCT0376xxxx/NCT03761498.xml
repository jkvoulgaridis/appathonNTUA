      This study evaluates the relationship between growth and stool microbiota in premature
      infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants often require increased caloric intake to maintain appropriate growth while
      in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). While some infants will have a clear source of
      need for greater calories, it is often not obvious why others require increased available
      calories to maintain appropriate growth. Emerging evidence suggests that patterns of gut
      microbiota may play a role in infant and childhood growth. We hypothesize that differences in
      the microbial pattern in preterm infants is related to poor growth and need for increased
      caloric intake. This may ultimately represent a therapeutic target to improve the growth of
      preterm infants in the NICU. This study aims to describe the differences in microbiome which
      may vary with growth pattern.
