  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study in healthy participants is to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of GRT0151Y after multiple oral intake of different increasing doses and to
      evaluate the pharmacological effects (action of the compound) by means of pupillometry
      (measuring the pupil size of the eye) and Cold Presser Test (measuring the pain when
      immersing the hand in 2 degree Celsius cold water). An additional aim of the study is to
      investigate the pharmacokinetics of GRT0151Y (how it is taken up into the body and how it is
      excreted from the body).&quot;

             electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory parameters (haematology, Blood
             sedimentation rate (BSR), clotting, bio-chemistry, urinalysis and virus serology).
             Minor deviations of laboratory values and ECG parameters from the normal range may be
             accepted, if judged by the investigator as clinically not relevant and if not
             considered to interfere with the study objectives.

             surgically sterilized or at least 2 years postmenopausal) this is defined as follows:
             any form of hormonal contraception or intra-uterine device must be used, at least for
             4 weeks prior to the first dosing AND she must give a consent to use an additional
             barrier contraception (condom or diaphragm) from 2 weeks prior to first dosing up to 4
