  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All cases of midcarpal wrist arthritis treated surgically with arthroscopic partial wrist
      fusion with cannulated screws from January 2015 to December 2017 will be reviewed.

      The union rate and time to union will be recorded following the standard radiological
      postoperative control. Wrist assessments performed pre- and postoperative regarding strength,
      range of motion and pain will be analysed. Complications will be recorded as well.

      Participants will be recruited for wrist assessment. They will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires about the functional result related to their quality of life.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function assessment through DASH (The disabilities of the arm, shoulder, hand) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire asks about patient's symptoms as well as their ability to perform certain activities in the last week. The DASH Outcome Measure is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (30 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance Sport/Music or Work section (4 items, scored 1-5). The response to the first 30 items of the DASH are added to form the raw, or actual, score. A minimum score is 30; a maximum is 150.The raw score is then transformed to a zero-to-100 scale with zero reflecting no disability (good function) and 100 reflecting maximum disability.
The maximum score of the second section is 20 with a minimum of 4. The range of scores is therefore 16. This score is also transformed to a zero-to-100 scale with lower scores reflecting minimal disability, and higher scores reflecting more disability.</description>

        All cases of arthroscopic mid-carpal wrist arthrodesis for mid-carpal arthritis, related to
        post-traumatic or degenerative carpal deformity, performed in our Division from January
        2015 to October 2017 will be studied. The approximate number of participants will be 15.
        There will be no control group.
