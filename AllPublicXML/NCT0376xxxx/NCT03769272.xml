    <textblock>
      Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) is a well-known treatment for patients with heart
      failure. It is a special pacemaker that consists of three pacing wires, which are implanted
      in the right upper and bottom chambers of the heart and via a vein on the surface of the main
      pumping chamber (left bottom chamber). CRT helps by improving co- ordination between the top
      and the bottom chambers of the heart. By stimulating the heart from the left and right bottom
      chambers, co-ordination can be restored and heart function as well as symptoms improve. It is
      known that up to 30-40% of patients of patients undergoing CRT pacemaker implantation do not
      attain any benefit. Given the inherent risks and costs of pacemaker implantation and
      maintenance, a reduction in the rate of CRT &quot;non-responders&quot; is an important goal.

      It has been suggested that presence of scar tissue in the heart and suboptimal placement of
      the pacing wire on the top of the main pumping chamber can explain this poor response. The
      best place to position the pacing wire on the surface of the main pumping chamber is the area
      that contracts last and it can be identified using ultrasound scan of the heart.

      Unfortunately, ultrasound is not always possible to help identifying the best area and only a
      minority of hospitals are able to use this method. Therefore we aim to investigate
      alternative ways of positioning the pacing wire in the best possible area of the main pumping
      heart chamber. Investigators propose to measure electrical signals as an alternative and more
      effective way in positioning the wire in the most effective area. Investigators aim to look
      at the relationship between the best area identified by ultrasound scan and by electrical
      signals and also use electrical signals to avoid areas of scar.

      Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) reduces both morbidity and mortality in selected
      patients with left ventricular dysfunction and intraventricular conduction delay who remain
      symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy.

      It is known that up to 30% of patients of patients undergoing CRT implantation do not attain
      symptomatic benefit . Given the inherent risks and costs of device implantation and
      maintenance, a reduction in the rate of CRT &quot;non-responders&quot; is an important goal.

      Factors associated with a poor outcome include presence of myocardial scar, and suboptimal
      Left Ventricular (LV) lead placement.

      Pacing the LV at the most delayed LV region promotes contractile synchrony resulting in more
      effective and energetically efficient ejection, geometric remodelling with reduced LV
      end-systolic volume and improved cardiac function.

      Studies using transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) parameters to target the LV lead
      positioning have shown that an optimal LV lead position at the site of latest mechanical
      activation, avoiding low strain amplitude (scar), was associated with superior response to
      CRT and improved survival that persisted during follow-up.

      It remains unclear whether the site of latest mechanical activation is related to the site of
      latest electrical activation, nor whether sensed electrical signals correspond to sites of
      scar. The site of latest electrical activation is assessed during CRT implant by measuring
      electrical activation (LV electrical delay) of the LV at different sites in relation to the
      first deflection of the QRS complex of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG).

      A recent study evaluated the relationship between LV electrical delay and CRT outcomes/
      response to CRT and concluded that electrical dyssynchrony was strongly and independently
      associated with reverse remodelling and led to improvement in the Quality of Life with CRT.

      Despite TTE being an effective way of assessing optimal LV lead positioning for identifying
      mechanical activation, it is expensive, images can be suboptimal and usually requires an
      extra visit prior to implantation, therefore an intraprocedural way of identifying the
      optimal areas could be beneficial.

      It is not known whether lead position as targeted by imaging methods of mechanical activation
      corresponds to the site of latest electrical activation, nor whether sensed electrical
      signals correspond to sites of scar. Investigators are planning to investigate the
      relationship between the site of latest mechanical activation using TTE and the site of
      latest electrical activation of the LV; and between scar and sensed electrical signals.

      If the area of latest mechanical activation is related to the area of latest electrical
      activation then this can be an alternative, more convenient and cost effective way of
      assessing optimal LV lead positioning.
