  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are important for health, for example for the immune
      system, heart health and the brain. PUFA are found in fish, nuts and oils; including these
      foods in the diet provides the body with PUFA. The body can also produce some PUFA in a
      series of steps. It has been found that genetics influences the levels of PUFA produced in
      the body. This study will investigate whether fish consumption influences PUFA status in
      women of childbearing age when accounting for FADS genotype by conducting a controlled human
      intervention study. Participants will be asked to consume none, one or two portions of oily
      fish per week for 8 weeks and their response in PUFA status measured. This study will also
      use collected blood, hair, urine and faecal samples collected from the intervention study to
      explore other biomarkers of fish consumption. The aim of this study is to investigate whether
      fish consumption influences PUFA status in women of childbearing age when accounting for FADS
      genotype and to explore the potential of a novel biomarker, using hair MeHg:δ34S values, to
      accurately predict fish consumption. The study will initially involve providing a buccal swab
      sample which will investigate genes which are related to fatty acids. The participant will
      provide a buccal swab sample so that their genotype can be determined. The researcher who
      will contact the participant once genotype has been determined to arrange a baseline
      appointment. Participants will attend the Human Intervention Studies Unit at Ulster
      University, Coleraine once or twice weekly for a period of 8 weeks where they will receive
      lunch. This lunch will contain either tuna, sardines, or no fish depending on the
      intervention group you will be allocated to. Examples of lunch time meals they may receive
      include sandwiches, baked potato or salad which will include the type of fish they have been
      allocated to receive. Those allocated to the no fish group will receive a fish free
      alternative lunch. Participants will be asked to continue to follow their normal diet and
      lifestyle over the intervention period of 8 weeks. All participants will attend a baseline
      and post intervention appointment where they will have weight, height and body composition
      measured. Participants will also complete questionnaires to provide medical, lifestyle and
      dietary information. All participants will be asked to provide a sample of blood, urine, hair
      and faeces to assess biomarkers of fish consumption at baseline and post intervention
      appointments. Collected blood, urine, hair and faecal samples will be analysed for biomarkers
      of fish consumption. Participants will also be asked to return to the Human Intervention
      Studies Unit (HISU) 8 weeks after the intervention study has been completed (week 16) to
      provide a third hair sample and complete a Fish Feedback Questionnaire. In the 8 wks
      following conclusion of the study they will be free to return to their normal diet.
