  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate whether healthy adults, who sometimes take
      drugs for pleasure, are likely to abuse GRT0151Y. This abuse potential is assessed at three
      different doses of GRT0151Y.

      During a Qualification Phase, a single dose of hydromorphone IR 8 mg and a single dose of
      placebo were separately administered orally over 4 days in a randomized, double-blinded
      manner.

      During the Treatment Phase, single doses of GRT0151Y free base (100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg),
      hydromorphone Immediate-release (IR) (4 mg, 8 mg, and 16 mg), and placebo were administered
      orally over 7 Treatment Periods.

      Participants received the treatments according to a 7-sequence, 7-period balanced design.

Sedation: Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group, 'PCAG' scale.
Participants indicate their responses by selecting &quot;False&quot; or &quot;True&quot; with a mouse. One point is given for each response that agrees with the scoring direction on the scale (i.e., True items receive a score of 1 if the answer is &quot;True&quot;, False items receive a score of 1 if the answer is &quot;False&quot;. No points (0) are given when the answer is opposite to the scoring direction). Higher scores indicated higher effects.</description>

    <description>Choice reaction time (CRT) is a computerized assessment that trains the participant to respond to stimuli presented on the screen. The task requires the participant to react as soon as a colored key appears in one of up to eight locations. The participant must respond by lifting their finger from the central start button and depressing the corresponding response key as quickly as possible. This is the reaction time (RT). Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Acceptable body mass index (BMI) (weight [kilograms]/height (square meter) range of 19
             to 30 kilograms per square meter, inclusive).

          -  Signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and
             procedures required for the study, and are willing to participate in the study.

          -  Participants with a history of recreational opiate use (defined as nontherapeutic use
             at least 10 times in the past year and at least once in the last 12 weeks prior to
             enrolment) but not dependent on opiates Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders-4th edition (DSM-IV criteria).

          -  Participants must consent to use a medically acceptable method of contraception
             throughout the entire study period, including washout periods. Men must confirm that,
             when having sexual intercourse with women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who
             are not surgically sterilized, or and not at least 2 years post-menopausal), they will
             use a condom from the time of the first dose until 4 weeks after the last dose and
             that the respective partner will use an additional contraceptive method. Men may be
             included if surgically sterile. For females of childbearing potential only: adequate
             contraception is defined as any form of hormonal contraception or intra-uterine device
             that needs to be in place for a period of at least two months prior to enrolment.
             Additional barrier contraception must be used for the duration of the study, defined
             as the time from the enrolment visit to the final examination, and for at least one
             full month thereafter. A single barrier method alone or abstinence alone is not
             acceptable. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included if surgically sterile
             or postmenopausal for at least two years.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (beta-Human chorionic gonadotropin) at the enrolment visit and before receiving study
             drug for each of the double-blind qualification and treatment periods. For females of
             childbearing potential, the time between the Enrolment Visit and first receipt of drug
             will be separated by a minimum of 10 days to ensure accuracy of the pregnancy test.

          -  Participants with a positive urine drug screen (for amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, phencyclidine and opiates) upon presentation
             for study days will be allowed to continue only if the investigator or designee
             considers that the presence of the drug will not introduce additional risk factors for
             the study participant, or interfere with study procedures or data integrity. Positive
             drug screens for select drugs are to be confirmed using quantitative methods such as
             Gas Chromatography (GC)/Mass Spectrometry (MS) or equivalent, and the investigator or
             designee's decision to allow participants to continue will take into account the
             quantitative levels of drug in the participants' urine. Participants may be
             rescheduled for another treatment session at the investigator's discretion.

          -  Deemed healthy on the basis of enrolment visit physical examination, medical history,
             12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters
             (biochemistry, urinalysis, clotting, blood sedimentation rate [BSR], haematology and
             hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] virus serology). If the results of
             the laboratory tests or the urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's
             reference ranges, the participant can be included only on condition that the
             investigator or designee judges that the deviations are not clinically relevant and do
             not interfere with the study objectives.

          -  Must have a negative breath alcohol analysis at enrolment. A positive alcohol reading
             is one that is above the error measurement associated with the breathalyzer.
             Participants presenting a positive alcohol breath test may be allowed to continue in
             the study only if the investigator (or designee) considers that the presence of breath
             alcohol does not suggest problematic alcohol consumption, and will not introduce
             additional risk factors for the study participant, or interfere with study procedures
             or data integrity.

          -  Must pass a qualifying session.

          -  Ability to speak, read and understand English sufficiently in order to understand the
             nature of the study, to provide written informed consent and to allow completion of
             all study assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or current substance dependence (except nicotine and caffeine dependence)
             as defined by the DSM-IV.

          -  Participants attempting to discontinue their recreational drug use, or who have been
             in a drug rehabilitation program in the 12 months prior to enrolment.

             replacement or birth control medications) including known CYP2D6 inhibitors and
             substrates which lower the seizure threshold within 14 days prior to the first study
             drug administration or monoamine-oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within 21 days prior to
             the first study drug administration.

          -  Participants who have taken a new chemical entity under development within the last 30
             days prior to receiving the first dose of IMP or longer, if on the basis of
             pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics, a possible interaction with study
             objective cannot be reasonably excluded.

          -  Not able to abstain from drinking of caffeine containing beverages (tea, coffee,
