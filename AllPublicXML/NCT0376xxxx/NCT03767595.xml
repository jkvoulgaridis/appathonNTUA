    <textblock>
      The ProACT Post Approval Study is a 5-year prospective, open-label, multi-center study
      designed to evaluate the long-term incidence of urethral stricture and device erosion after
      ProACT implantation. In addition, the study will evaluate whether treatment with ProACT
      affects clinical outcomes after subsequent SUI therapies.

    <measure>Effect of ProACT on Subsequent Stress Urinary Incontinence(SUI) Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This data will be collected with a &quot;Post ProACT Explant Subsequent Therapy Questionnaire&quot;.
This questionnaire will ask 3 questions regarding the ProACT therapy
Did the ProACT therapy have a detrimental effect on the difficulty of the subsequent implant surgery?
Did the ProACT therapy significantly increase the time required to implant the subsequent implant surgery?
Did the ProACT therapy increase the surgical complication rate during the subsequent implant surgery?
The scale for each question is 0-1. 0 Meaning no effect (a &quot;No&quot; response on the questionnaire) and 1 being some effect (&quot;Yes&quot; response on the questionnaire). No effect (0) on subsequent SUI therapies is the better outcome.</description>

             last 12 months.

          3. Subject has an artificial urinary sphincter or any components of a previously
             implanted artificial urinary sphincter in vivo.

          4. Subject has undergone radiation therapy in the prostatic area within the last 12
             months.

          5. Subject has untreated or unsuccessfully treated detrusor instability or over-activity.

          6. Subject has an atonic bladder.
