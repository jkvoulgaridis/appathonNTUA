  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If a patient speaks during the process of preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen via the
      Optiflow™ system, is the efficacy reduced as measured by end-tidal lung oxygen content?

      This is a randomised controlled trial on 34 patients undergoing routine elective surgery at
      the Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton. The study will take place from September 2018 to
      January 2019 and involve preoxygenating all participants for three minutes using the
      Optiflow™ device. During this time, participants will be instructed to either read aloud a
      standardised text or to breathe through their nose with a closed mouth. At the end of 3
      minutes, the primary outcome, ETO2, will be measured and recorded.
