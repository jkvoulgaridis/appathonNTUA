    <description>The Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a ten-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Items in the scale assess apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts and suicidal thoughts. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). Definitions of severity are provided at two-point intervals. The total score of the ten items ranges from 0 to 60. The primary endpoint will be evaluated with MADRS-6 subscale score, calculated based on the scores on MADRS items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 which cover core symptoms (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic thoughts) and is more sensitive to the effect of treatment.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function. The CGI consists of two clinician-rated subscales: severity of illness (CGI-S) and global improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). In all cases, the assessment should be made independent of whether the rater believes the improvement is drug-related or not.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function. The CGI consists of two clinician-rated subscales: severity of illness (CGI-S) and global improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-S provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>
