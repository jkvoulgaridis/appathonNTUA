  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twelve people with FM will be recruited from the FM patient support groups. The investigators
      will develop and test a 4-week prehabilitation educational programme (i.e., a behavioural
      change intervention) consisting of meeting once per week (each approximately 1 - 1.5 hours).
      These dynamic and interactive meetings will focus on education and skills training in:
      exercise, activity cycling, pacing, causes of symptoms in FM (pain, fatigue, sleep
      dysfunction) and their management.

      Participants will be taught to set specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timed
      goals (SMART principle) that are valuable or meaningful to them. To do so, the participants
      will identify a 'committed action' plan. The principles of cognitive behavioural therapy will
      be used to address maladaptive thoughts (e.g., catastrophizing and fear avoidance) and to
      manage stress (e.g., skills of relaxation). Participants will learn how to use of pedometers
      to monitor physical activity.

      After the 4-week prehabilitation educational programme, the participants will be encouraged
      to engage in a 6-week gentle self-paced walking programme (with weekly telephone support).

      The 6-week walking programme will consist of a simple pedometer-driven intervention.

      Furthermore, the research team will telephone each participant at a prearranged time each
      week to discuss progress, to document mean daily step count and to discuss a new physical
      activity target (step count) for the subsequent week. Participants will record daily step
      counts (pedometer-derived) in a walking dairy which will be used as raw data and mean steps
      per day calculated. Where a participant declines telephone support, an alternative weekly
      email or text/WhatsApp messages will be offered instead, where the same information will be
      given and requested.

      Before (baseline measurements) and right after the completion of the 4-week prehabilitation
      educational programme as well as the 6-week gentle self-paced walking programme the same
      measurements will be taken. By doing so, the investigators will evaluate short and mid-term
      changes promoted by the prehabilitation programme. The participants will fill out the
      following questionnaires: the Revised FM Impact Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale,
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Short-Form 36-item Health Survey, International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire, Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire, Exercise Self Efficacy
      Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire, and the modified 2011
      preliminary FM criteria questionnaire.

      Right after the completion of the prehabiliation intervention, all the participants will fill
      out the treatment acceptability and credibility questionnaire. Right after the completion of
      the walking programme, participants will be interviewed (semistructured face-to-face exit
      interview lasting about 30-45 minutes) to explore their experiences of the study including
      barriers to participation.

      The main outcome of the study will be acceptability and credibility of the prehabilitation
      intervention (treatment acceptability and credibility questionnaire. Additionally, the
      success of the prehabilitation programme will be based on (i) number of sessions attended
      (&gt;80%), (ii) number of drop outs (&lt;15%) and reasons for early withdrawal, (iii) number of
      screening questionnaires completed and returned (&gt;80%).

    <description>Pain catastrophizing is the tendency to describe a pain experience in more exaggerated terms than the average person, to ruminate on it more (e.g., &quot;I kept thinking 'this is terrible'&quot;), and/or to feel more helpless about the experience (&quot;I thought it was never going to get better&quot;). Pain catastrophizing will be measured by means of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale is a 13-item questionnaire in which patients are asked to reflect on past painful experiences and indicate their thoughts or feelings about pain, on a 5-point scale. For this study, the total score (range 0-52) was used, where higher scores represent a more negative appraisal of pain.</description>

    <description>The 4-week prehabilitation educational programme will consist of a meeting for one session (approximately 1 - 1.5 hours) per week. This behavioural change programme will involve a mixture of interactive and didactic sessions, facilitated by a physiotherapist, psychologists, and other health professionals. The purpose of the initial prehabilitation programme is to gain participant 'buy-in' to the programme, to assist participants engage with exercise, to help participants overcome barriers to exercise and improve self-efficacy for exercise. The prehabilitation phase will also enable participants to understand why and how to perform gentle self-paced exercise. After the prehabilitation programme, participants will be advised to engage in a 6-week gentle self-paced walking programme; i.e., a simple pedometer-driven walking programme with weekly telephone support.</description>
