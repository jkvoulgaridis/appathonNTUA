  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 1608-EORTC-BTG study - Wait or Treat - concerns patients that represent a clinically
      favorable group of patients with IDHmutated astrocytoma (oligo-symptomatic), without a need
      for immediate post-operative treatment. It will establish whether early adjuvant treatment
      with radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide in resected IDHmutated astrocytoma will improve
      outcome, and whether benefits of early treatment outweigh potential side-effects of that,
      such as deterioration in neurocognitive function or Quality of Live, seizure activity and
      Patient Reported outcome compared to active surveillance.

    <description>This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, for adverse event reporting.
Hematological toxicity will be assessed on the basis of blood counts. The nadir count will be assessed for each cycle of TMZ therapy, and graded according to CTCAE.

    <description>The main objectives of TR are the assessment of markers that can identify patients in whom an active surveillance policy is not recommended or who are at risk to develop delayed complications is important. Furthermore, identification of predictive factors that could guide when to start RT and chemotherapy would aid the implementation of an active surveillance approach in clinical practice.</description>

             the ability of the patient to complete the study
