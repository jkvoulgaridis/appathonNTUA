    <textblock>
      Based on the need of clinical practice of maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC and the
      reliable data of third-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the investigators
      designed a clinical study of antinil hydrochloride versus pemetrexed in maintenance therapy
      for advanced NSCLC to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of antinil hydrochloride in
      maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC. Value, to provide a scientific basis for prolonging
      the survival time of patients with advanced NSCLC, improving the quality of life of patients
      in the course of treatment, and optimizing treatment strategies to a greater extent.

      This study is planned to be carried out in Jiangsu regional multi-center. 83 cases are
      preliminarily expected to be included. The study started in December 2018 and ended in
      December 2019. It is expected that the trial will end in December 2020.

      In the absence of such situations as withdrawal of informed consent, intolerance of drug
      toxicity and side effects, or inappropriateness for further trials, each participant's
      expected time for research and treatment will continue until radiographically confirmed tumor
      progression occurs.
