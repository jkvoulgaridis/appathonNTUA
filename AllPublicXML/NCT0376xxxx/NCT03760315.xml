  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      mNGS is popular in research and recently it has been used clinically to detect microbes in
      the blood or other secretion in infected patients for quicker ,broad and accurate detection
      of microbes. In ICU ,patients are critically ill and need quicker and accurate antibiotics
      use to stop the pathologic process. This study is to evaluate whether the mNGS can detect
      microbe ,guide antibiotics use and improve outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      patients in our ICU were took Culture sample and mNGS (diagnosis of Sepsis with Cell-free DNA
      by Next-Generation Sequencing Technology)sample. Clinicians use their knowledge and
      experience to decide antibiotics use with the guide of Culture results or mNGS results.
      According to the way of guide, the researcher divide patients into (1)mNGS targeted group ,
      (2)Culture targeted group and (3)Experience group. First evaluate how much can mNGS guide
      clinical antibiotics use. Secondly to evaluate the time consuming and accuracy between the
      mNGS and Culture methods. Finally, to compare the clinical outcome, microbiologic outcome and
      survival rate antibiotics and so on between the groups.
