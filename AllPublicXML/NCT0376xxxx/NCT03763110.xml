    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare regenerative endodontics for necrotic young permanent anterior
      teeth using oral photo-activated disinfection versus triple antibiotic paste in terms of:

        1. Clinical success in terms of absence of any complication such as spontaneous pain, sinus
           or swelling.

        2. Radiographic success in terms of healing of periapical radiolucency or increase root
           thickness, length or apical closure.

      Disinfection of the root canal system is thought to be critical to the success of
      Regenerative Endodontic Procedures (REPs) as infection prevents regeneration, repair and stem
      cell activity . A suitable material for using as intra-canal medicament seems to be
      antibiotic. Triple antibiotic paste (TAP) containing metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and
      minocycline has been reported to be a successful regimen in controlling the root canal
      pathogen and in managing necrotic young permanent tooth .

      Recently, new disinfection methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of
      conventional disinfecting protocols that they may neither reduce the number of bacteria to a
      satisfactory level nor minimize the toxicity to periapical stem/progenitors . Other concerns
      regarding the use of TAP are tooth discoloration after treatment and bacterial resistance.
      Photo-activated oral disinfection is a novel disinfection method which present a great
      solution for the problem associated with triple antibiotic paste

    <description>Photoactivated disinfection (PAD) is based on the interaction of a photosensitive antibacterial agent and a light source. It uses a nontoxic dye [named photosensitizer PS] and low-intensity visible light. In oxygen presentation, these combine to produce some cytotoxic species. The PS molecules attach to bacteria membrane</description>
