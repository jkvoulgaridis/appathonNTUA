  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is designed to assess the efficacy of a capsule containing beta-glucan
      taken orally daily as compared to a placebo capsule on the URTI symptoms, and the immune
      response change in marathon runners

      At screening, an informed consent form will be given to the potential volunteer. They will be
      required to read the information and will be given the opportunity to seek more information
      if needed or provided with the option of taking the consent form home to review prior to
      making their decision. If agreeable, the volunteer will sign the consent form and receive a
      duplicate of the signed copy. Once consent has been obtained, the screening visit will
      proceed. Each volunteer will be sequentially assigned a screening number to be entered in the
      screening and enrollment log. Screening assessments include: review medical history, assess
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, vitals, study diary, URTI symptom questionnaire, bowel
      diary, and GI symptom questionnaire.

      The next visit will be scheduled 14 days prior to their marathon date (baseline).
      Participants will be reminded to complete URTI questionnaire, daily study diary, modified GI
      symptoms and bowel diary in advance of this baseline visit. At baseline participants will
      begin daily completion of study diaries, URTI questionnaires, daily bowel diaries, and GI
      tolerance questionnaires. In clinic subjects will complete mood and stress questionnaires,
      and blood sample for the analysis of CRP and NK cell activity. In addition, on the day of the
      marathon the participant will be instructed to complete a muscle soreness assessment.

      Two and four weeks post-marathon participants will return to the clinic for with unused
      investigational product, completed study diaries, daily URTI questionnaires, daily bowel
      diaries, and GI tolerance questionnaires. In clinic subjects will complete mood and stress
      questionnaires, and blood sample for the analysis of CRP and NK cell activity.

    <masking_description>A randomization schedule will be created and provided to the Investigator indicating the order of randomization. Each participant will be assigned a randomization code according to the order of the randomization list generated using www.randomization.com. Enrolled participants will be randomized to the different treatment arms at day -14. Concealment of the allocation of treatment will be employed through the use of opaque sealed envelopes, each labeled with a randomization number. Each envelope will contain information regarding the treatment associated with each randomization number.</masking_description>
