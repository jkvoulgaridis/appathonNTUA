  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative Care focuses on symptom management and quality of life and helps patients with
      life-limiting illness match goals and preferences for care. While there has been interest in
      and acknowledgement that palliative care is an important part of training patient navigators,
      there have been no previous studies examining the effectiveness of a navigation intervention
      to improve palliative care for patients. This study will examine the feasibility to implement
      patient navigator and psychosocial interventions.
