        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent in a language understandable to the subject prior to any
             study-mandated procedure.

          -  Male and female subjects aged ≥ 18 years at Screening.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening Visit 2 and on Day 1 pre-dose of the
             first period. They must agree to consistently and correctly use a highly effective
             method of contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year.

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, i.e., postmenopausal, with previous bilateral
             salpingectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy, or with premature
             ovarian failure, XY genotype, Turner syndrome, and/or uterine agenesis.

          -  Diagnosis of OSA according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders
             documented by medical history and confirmed in a sleep laboratory in the context of
             diagnosing OSA within the last 3 years.

          -  Patient with mild to moderate intensity of OSA determined during OSA diagnosis and

             investigator judgment, including evidence of severe insomnia (i.e., sleep time &lt; 5 h)
             periodic limb movement disorder with arousal index ≥ 10/h, restless legs syndrome,
             circadian rhythm disorder, REM behavior disorder, parasomnia including nightmare
             disorder, sleep terror disorder, and/or sleepwalking disorder.

          -  Need for continuous positive airway pressure device or a dental appliance device
             within the preceding 7 days prior to Screening Visit 2 and during the course of the
             study, i.e., from Screening Visit 2 to EOS.

          -  Evidence of any other clinically significant active pulmonary disease such as chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (as per Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung
             Disease), based on investigator's judgment.

          -  History of surgical intervention for obstructive sleep apnea, except nose surgery.

          -  SaO2 &lt; 90% during wakefulness or mean non-apneic SaO2 (i.e., outside events of
             apnea/hypopnea) &lt; 85% for &gt; 5 consecutive min during the screening night PSG.
