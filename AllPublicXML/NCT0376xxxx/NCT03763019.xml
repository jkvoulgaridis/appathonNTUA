  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of respiratory exercises on respiratory function test
      parameters and ultrasonographic diaphragmatic measurements. Half of the hemiplegic patients
      will receive respiratory and neurophysiological exercises, while other half will receive only
      neurophysiological exercises.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After stroke, diaphragm, the most important muscle of respiration, is wasted as well as the
      other muscles of the affected side.

      Ultrasonography is a non-invasive, practical, low cost utility that may measure the thickness
      of diaphragm in maximum expiration and inspiration thus examining the functionality of the
      muscle. Correlation between respiratory functional tests and diaphragm ultrasonography has
      been proven in recent literature. In this manner, the aim of this study is twofold. First is
      to determine whether ultrasonography can be used practically to evaluate the respiratory
      functions of the patients after stroke. Respiratory function tests will be used for the
      correlation analysis. Second is to evaluate the effectiveness of respiratory exercises via
      diaphragm ultrasonography and respiratory function tests.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Measured by spirometry. &gt;80% is normal. If the value is lower than the normal limit it indicates either an obstructive or restrictive disease. The lower values show a poorer outcome</description>

    <description>The maximal amount of air you can forcefully exhale in one second. Measured by spirometry. &gt;80% is normal. If there is an obstruction, this measurement shows the severity of the obstruciton. The lower values show a poorer outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Calculated as FEV1/FVC. &gt;80% is normal. ≤80% indicates an obstructive pulmonary disease.</description>

    <description>The average forced expiratory flow during the mid (25% - 75%) portion of the FVC. Shows small and medium airway obstruction. &gt;70% is normal. It shows the small airways impariment</description>

    <measure>Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (TF)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Thickness of the diaphragm is measured from the zone of apposition (subcostal area between anterior axillary line and mid-axillary line) via ultrasonography. After diaphragm thickness in end expiration (thickness in functional residual capacity- TFRC) and in end inspiration (thickness in total lung capacity- TTLC) are obtained. Thickening fraction is calculated as [TTLC-TFRC/TFRC]x100. A higher value shows a better outcome.</description>
