  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if the use of Envarsus in place of
      Tacrolimus-immediate release (IR) in rapid metabolizers post kidney transplant will reduce
      incidence of BK infection. Efficacy evaluations will include measurement of urine and serum
      BK values at specified time points and review of any biopsy for BK virus nephropathy.
      Incidence of rejection, graft failure, and graft dysfunction will also be measured at
      specified time points.

    <textblock>
      This will be a single center prospective case control study. The investigators expect 40% of
      patients will develop BK viruria, 20% BK viremia, 5% BK viral nephropathy (BKVN). Patients
      will be managed using standard of care for the investigator's center (thymoglobulin
      induction, tacrolimus/mycophenolate/prednisone). Target tacrolimus level is 8-12 ng/mL for
      the first 6 months post transplant and 6-9 ng/mL thereafter. BK urine/serum is monitored at
      1, 3, 6, 9, 2 months post transplant. A population of 100 patients is calculated to show
      significant difference for p value &lt; 0.05.

      Population:

      Study Group: Post transplant patients (kidney transplant alone) with standard of care
      immunosuppression, no prior rejection, prior BK or opportunistic infection, and negative BK
      screening at post-transplant month 1, who have a tacrolimus concentration/dose of &lt; 1 and a
      steady state therapeutic level will be eligible. Patients who consent will be converted to
      Envarsus at 20% reduction in tacrolimus dose.

      Control Group: Post transplant patients (kidney transplant alone performed between 10-2016
      and time of enrollment) with standard of care immunosuppression, no prior rejection, prior BK
      or opportunistic infection, whom had a negative BK screening at post-transplant month 1 and
      tacrolimus concentration/dose of &lt; 1 at post-transplant month 1, and BK data available for
      months 2, 3, 6, 9,12 post transplant.
