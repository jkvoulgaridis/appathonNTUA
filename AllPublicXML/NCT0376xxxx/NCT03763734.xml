  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Study is to test a higher dose of steroids(Dexamethasone) given just prior
      to surgery in the setting of Fast-Track Knee surgery with Arthroplasty in a group of expected
      High Pain Responders and the effect on postoperative pain and postoperative inflammation.

    <textblock>
      This study compares a new High-Dose dosage of steroids in the treatment of postoperative pain
      after Knee Arthroplasty in a Fast-Track setting in a group of expected High Pain Responders.

      The investigators compare the already used dose(medium dose) with a new high dose(HD) steroid
      given as an intravenous bolus after the spinal anaesthesia has been given, but before the
      surgery starts.

      The hypothesis is that by attenuating the inflammatory response to the surgery itself by the
      steroid Dexamethasone, the investigators expect a reduction in postoperative pain upon
      ambulation 24 hours after unilateral Knee Arthroplasty.

      Patients referred to Unilateral Total KneeArthroplasty because of knee-osteoarthritis at
      Hvidovre Hospital, Capital Region of Denmark or Vejle Hospital, South Region of Denmark are
      screened and offered inclusion in the study.

      The two groups will be randomized and double blinded. One group will be treated, as the
      current guideline in the investigator's Orthopedic fast-track Arthroplasty center, with the
      medium dose of steroid (0,3 mg dexamethasone/kg bodyweight).

      The other group wil be treated with a high dose of steroid (1,0 mg dexamethasone/kg
      bodyweight).

      The patients will be monitored the first 7 days after surgery, during the admission to the
      hospital, and by a Pain-diary in the patients own home.

      Blood tests will be taken preoperatively and postoperatively to determine the effect of the
      highdose steroid on the inflammatory response.

    <description>Pain summarized over the first 7 days after surgery, assessed by a summation of the Visual Analog Scale(VAS)-scores in the first 7 days as noted in the pain diary filed in by the participants.
Pain is monitored by the Visual Analog Scale(VAS) 0-100 mm, where 0 is no pain and 100 mm is the worst pain one can imagine. Moderate pain is considered a VAS &gt;30 mm.</description>

    <description>An investigation into reason of why our patients remain in the hospital in the days after total Knee Arthroplasty in our Fast-Track center. This is investigated through a questionnaire previously used in a similar investigation in our center.
The questionnaire is filled in by our project nurse. the questionnaire is a checkmark schedule with predetermined reasons to stay in hospital like low bloodpressure, sedation, dizzyness, lack of physiotherapy and medical and surgical complications.
The outcome assesment will be descriptive.</description>
