  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Martinique, about 33 new cases are diagnosed per year, with a high incidence rate of type
      2 endometrial carcinoma which has a poor prognosis with few therapeutic options. Although
      targeted therapies are used in many types of cancer, they are still possible a minority of
      patients. In current practice, endometrial cancers do not benefit these therapies.
      Characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in the genesis of type 2 endometrial
      carcinoma could help to identify biomarkers predictive of a response to targeted therapies.
      We propose to identify the genetic profile of type 2 endometrial carcinomas in Martinique.

      Type 2 endometrial carcinomas are often diagnosed at advanced stages, with an high risk of
      metastatic recurrence and death even when diagnosed at early stages. They also have few
      therapeutic options. The Characterize the mutations responsible of cancer development has led
      to develope &quot;precision medicine&quot; that targets &quot;actionable genes&quot; by a drug. This concept of
      actionable mutation refers to a change in the DNA molecule that can predict the response to a
      drug defined as targeted therapy. Although targeted therapies are used in many types of
      cancer, they still target a minority of patients. Some tumor sites still do not benefit from
      these treatments. Specifically, type 2 endometrial cancers that have poor prognosis with few
      therapeutic options. The characterization of molecular mechanisms, by Next Generation
      Sequencing (NGS), involved in the carcinogenesis of endometrial cancers, particularly type 2
      cancers, should allow the identification of predictive biomarkers for response to certain
      targeted therapies.
