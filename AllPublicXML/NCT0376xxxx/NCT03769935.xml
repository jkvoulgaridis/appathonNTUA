    <textblock>
      This study involves patients treated with cisplatin and etoposide (induction therapy),
      followed by treatment with a drug called S1 (maintenance therapy). The main purpose of this
      study is to determine if this type of treatment will delay the growth of the tumor and if so,
      for how long. The primary endpoint is progression free survival and second endpoints are
      toxicities, overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 20% of lung cancer, has a high degree of
      malignancy, short doubling time, early and widespread metastasis, is sensitive to
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and has a high initial response rate, but is prone to
      secondary drug resistance and relapse. The treatment is mainly based on systemic
      chemotherapy, and if maintenance therapy with S1 after standard EP regimen induction therapy
      could prolong progression free survival.
