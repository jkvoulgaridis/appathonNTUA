  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a larger scale clinical trial of different
      methods of supporting families in finding mental health and/or addictions (MHA) services for
      youth.Youth with MHA issues and their families are particularly vulnerable in the MHA system,
      due to a lack of specialized support and complicated transitions between services. The
      potential impact of Navigation on youth MHA symptom reduction or functional improvement,
      family functioning, satisfaction with MHA services, as well as the cost-benefit of Navigation
      has not been evaluated. This project will explore the feasibility of a trial of Navigation to
      determine whether there is a difference for those youth with MHA issues and their families
      who receive Navigation over those who find and access MHA care on their own.
