      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1
      antibody SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced
      cancerous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      The incidence of esophageal cancer is ranked seventh in the world, and the mortality rate
      ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer
      is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the
      failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. The
      investigators designed a single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody
      SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced cancerous
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18~75 years, both men and women.

          2. Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) confirmed diagnosis of esophageal
             squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)， and locally advanced unresectable, local recurrence or
             distant metastasis.

             lavender or fluorouracil) progression or intolerance (progress in maintenance therapy
             after first-line chemotherapy can also be included). Synchronous chemoradiotherapy for
             postoperative recurrence or metastasis is considered as first-line treatment; For
             radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or
             chemoradiotherapy), if disease progression occurs during treatment or within 6 months
             after stopping treatment, Count it as a first-line treatment failure.
