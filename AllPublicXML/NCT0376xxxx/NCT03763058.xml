  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a frequent pathology, highly linked to anxio-depressive factors. Non-drug
      approaches are part of the therapeutic arsenal. Music therapy is a recent discipline
      expanding in hospital services and specialised ambulatory centers. The main objective of this
      study is to assess the effect of &quot; U &quot; technique in receptive music therapy on migraine
      frequency, on patients suffering from episodic migraines, through &quot; Music care &quot; software
      home use. Secondary objectives are to assess this technique impact on migraine intensity,
      duration, emotional effect (HAD score), functional impact (HIT-6 score), and acute treatment
      administration. This is a monocentric prospective before-after study carried out in chronic
      pain department of the CHU Sud Reunion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite converging evidence that music interventions are beneficial in a number of pain
      domains, additional research is needed to understand the impact of a music intervention on
      the debilitating nature of migraine headaches. Interestingly, a recently developed smartphone
      application called Music Care has been introduced as a music-intervention tool; however music
      type is controlled by the individual. A patient-controlled music intervention administered by
      Music Care has shown to alleviate negative psychological (e.g., depression) and physiological
      (e.g., pain and discomfort) outcomes associated with general chronic pain. However, no study
      has examined how music interventions administered via Music Care may be beneficial for
      individuals who experience migraines, thus potentially highlighting the effects of receptive
      music techniques in music therapy.

      Therefore, the present investigation sought to examine the potential benefits of a
      patient-controlled, 3-month music intervention in individuals diagnosed with migraine
      headaches using the Music Care application. Patients from the university hospital center Sud
      Reunion (Saint Pierre, Reunion Island, France) within the Chronic Pain Consultation Group
      will be evaluated for inclusion in the study and will complete the 3-month music
      intervention. Participants will complete 1-2 sessions of listening to music per day, with a
      minimum of 15 sessions per month.

      The following measures will be collected: the frequency of migraine attacks, the average
      duration of migraine attacks and the average intensity of migraine attacks. Patients will
      also rate levels of anxiety and depression associated with migraine headaches via the
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). The impact migraines have on everyday level of
      functioning will be evaluated using the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6).

      This is a pilot study, non-randomized, single arm and single center study.

    <time_frame>1 month prior to intervention (pre-treatment) up to 3 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>All data related to migraine like frequency, duration, severity are to be collected in a diary questionnaire. Per ANAES (Agence nationale de l'accréditation et de l'évaluation en santé) recommendations, this means reduction of 50% on frequency of migraine attacks after 3-month treatment period. Comparison will be done between the number of days in the month prior the first music intervention and the number of days in the 3rd month of intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Migraine Attacks (Hours)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month prior to intervention (pre-treatment) up to 3 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is the mean duration of migraine attacks per month. Comparison will be done between the month prior the first music intervention and the 3rd month of intervention. The mean duration is calculated by summing the total duration during the month divided by the number of attacks in the month.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month prior to intervention (pre-treatment) up to 3 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This data is collected as mild, moderate or severe. The same analysis as the primary outcome will be done by severity. So the frequency of migraine attacks will be compared for each severity.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be evaluated using the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score. The total score range is 36-78. A higher score indicates a worse impact of migraines on daily life. Comparison will be done between the score obtained before first music session and at the evaluation done after 3 months of music intervention.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). The total scores range is 0-21 for both depression and anxiety scores. A higher score indicates a worse depression and anxiety. Comparison will be done between the score obtained before first music session and at the evaluation done after 3 months of music intervention.</description>

    <description>The music intervention is administered via a smartphone- (and computer-) based application called Music Care. The Music Care app is a receptive music intervention, allowing the patient to freely adjust the length of and choose the preferred style between different sequences of instrumental music. All musical pieces were recorded in high-quality recording studios with professional musicians. Music Care utilizes the &quot;U&quot; technique designed to gradually relax the listener. The &quot;U&quot; technique is implemented using a musical sequence of 20 minutes that was divided into 5 different musical pieces at 3 to 4 minutes each.
Participants will complete 1-2 sessions of listening to music per day, with a minimum of 15 sessions per month.</description>

        <title>Frequency of Migraine Attacks (Number of Days Per Month)</title>
        <description>All data related to migraine like frequency, duration, severity are to be collected in a diary questionnaire. Per ANAES (Agence nationale de l'accréditation et de l'évaluation en santé) recommendations, this means reduction of 50% on frequency of migraine attacks after 3-month treatment period. Comparison will be done between the number of days in the month prior the first music intervention and the number of days in the 3rd month of intervention.</description>

Music Therapy: The music intervention was administered via a smartphone- (and computer-) based application called Music Care. The Music Care app is a receptive music intervention, allowing the patient to freely adjust the length of and choose the preferred style between different sequences of instrumental music. All musical pieces were recorded in high-quality recording studios with professional musicians. Music Care utilizes the “U” technique designed to gradually relax the listener. The “U” technique is implemented using a musical sequence of 20 minutes that was divided into 5 different musical pieces at 3 to 4 minutes each.
Participants completed 1-2 sessions of listening to music per day, with a minimum of 15 sessions per month.</description>

          <title>Music Intervention</title>
          <description>The music intervention is administered via a smartphone- (and computer-) based application called Music Care.
Music Therapy: The music intervention was administered via a smartphone- (and computer-) based application called Music Care. The Music Care app is a receptive music intervention, allowing the patient to freely adjust the length of and choose the preferred style between different sequences of instrumental music. All musical pieces were recorded in high-quality recording studios with professional musicians. Music Care utilizes the “U” technique designed to gradually relax the listener. The “U” technique is implemented using a musical sequence of 20 minutes that was divided into 5 different musical pieces at 3 to 4 minutes each.
Participants completed 1-2 sessions of listening to music per day, with a minimum of 15 sessions per month.</description>
