  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence crossover
      study in healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the effect of food on the PK of
      levoketoconazole.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In each period of the randomized, two period crossover study, levoketoconazole will be
      administered orally as a single dose of 600 mg levoketoconazole to subjects in the fasted
      state or fed (at 30 minutes after beginning consumption of a standardized high-fat meal).
      Subjects assigned to one treatment in Period 1 will be assigned to the opposite treatment in
      Period 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18-55 years of age, inclusive, at time of consent.

          2. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2, inclusive.

          3. Subject is in good general physical health as determined by absence of clinically
             significant medical history, physical examination findings, vital signs, clinical
             laboratory evaluations, and ECG measurements.

          4. Subject has not consumed and agrees to abstain from taking any prescription drugs,
             dietary supplements including vitamins and herbal preparations, or non-prescription
             drugs (except as authorized by the Investigator AND Medical Monitor) for 14 days prior
             to CRU admission, during washout period, and through Follow-Up.

          5. Subject has not consumed alcohol-containing beverages for 3 days prior to CRU
             admission and agrees not to consume alcohol through Follow-Up.

          6. Subject is a nonsmoker (for at least 3 months) with negative urinary cotinine test at
             Screening and agrees to abstain from tobacco- and nicotine-containing products for the
             duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of any out-of-normal-range laboratory value at Screening that has not been
             reviewed, approved, and documented as Not Clinically Significant by the Investigator.

          2. Concurrent medical illness that would interfere with the conduct of the study in the

          3. History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic,
             endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, chronic
             respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Positive urine drug screen for drugs-of-abuse, including cocaine,
             tetrahydrocannabinol, opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and barbiturates, and/or
             positive urine screen for alcohol at Screening and CRU admission.

          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within the longer of 30 days or five half-lives
             of the investigational drug preceding the first dose of study drug.

          6. Subject is positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and/or
             hepatitis C on Screening assessments.

          7. Subject has an acute illness within 7 days of CRU admission.

          8. Subject has donated plasma within 7 days of drug administration.

          9. Subject has donated 1 or more pints of blood (or equivalent blood loss) within 30 days
             prior to drug administration.

         10. History of caffeine consumption exceeding 8 cups of coffee/day (1 cup = 8 fluid
             ounces) within 14 days prior to first dose, or consumption of any caffeine- or
             chocolate-containing products for 3 days prior to CRU admission each week.
             Caffeine-containing foods and/or beverages (e.g., tea and cola) should be considered
             equivalent to coffee.

         11. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

         12. Males with hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL; Females with hemoglobin less than 11.0
             g/dL.

         13. Subjects who have had difficulties with swallowing whole tablets.

         14. Subjects with body habitus preventing repeated venipuncture as required by protocol.
