  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the optimal training intensity and the minimum
      training duration needed to maximize immediate improvements in walking capacity in chronic
      stroke. A single-blind, phase II, 3-site randomized controlled trial has been planned. Fifty
      persons &gt;6 months post stroke will randomize to either moderate-intensity aerobic locomotor
      training or high-intensity interval locomotor training; each for 45 minutes, 3x/week for up
      to 36 total sessions over approximately 12 weeks. Clinical measures of walking function,
      aerobic fitness, daily walking activity and quality of life will be assessed at baseline
      (PRE) and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of training (POST-4WK, POST-8WK, POST-12WK).

             assessed by a physical therapist

         12. Clinically significant neurologic disorder other than stroke or unable to walk outside

         13. Other significant medical condition likely to limit improvement or jeopardize safety
