  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study proposes an open clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of a
      social functioning intervention on bariatric surgery outcomes and depression. The treatment
      will be administered in a group format over 10 weekly/biweekly sessions and will take place
      at the University of Washington Weight Loss Management Clinic (WLMC) at the Roosevelt Clinic
      location. Effects of the intervention will be measured with self-report questionnaires and by
      self-report of behaviors outside of assessment sessions (via questionnaires and self-report
      of adherence to treatment). Data collection will occur at specific time points including
      before treatment, after treatment, and two months after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As of 2009, 344,000 bariatric procedures were performed annually . Although some studies
      report depressive symptoms decrease in the 6 months after bariatric surgery, there is growing
      body of literature suggesting there exists a subgroup of patients whose depressive symptoms
      worsen after surgery and the likelihood of developing depressive symptoms increases
      longitudinally. Depression can be an indicator of an increased risk of self-harm and
      additional studies have found that the risk of suicide may increase post bariatric surgery
      compared to obese individuals who have not undergone surgery.

      Research supports that psychosocial factors contribute to successful postoperative outcomes.
      Functional Analytic Psychotherapy shows potential to impact social variables that may be
      relevant to bariatric surgery outcomes including depression. In this context, FAP aims to
      improve interpersonal relationships through experientially teaching skills intended to
      increase social connection. FAP also seeks to increase awareness, which includes the ability
      to view interpersonal interactions from multiple perspectives, allowing new interpersonal
      skills to emerge.

      The present study seeks to evaluate the use of a FAP group to enhance interpersonal relating
      with a sample of post-bariatric surgery patients. Measures will be collected on quality of
      life and variables involved in interpersonal connectedness.
