    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are:

      In the Phase 1 portion of the study: To assess the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose regimen (RP2DR) of REGN5458 as
      monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) who have exhausted
      all therapeutic options that are expected to provide meaningful clinical benefit. The
      determination of the RP2DR will be based on the review of non-clinical and all clinical data,
      including that pertaining to safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), PK/PD
      (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) relationships, and efficacy.

      In the Phase 2 portion of the study: To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      REGN5458 as measured by objective response rate (ORR)

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

      In the phase 1 and phase 2 portion:

        -  To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5458 as measured by duration of
           response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)
           negative status, and overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the (PK) properties of REGN5458

        -  To characterize the immunogenicity of REGN5458

      In the Phase 1 portion only:

        -  To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5458 as measured by ORR

      In the Phase 2 portion only:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN5458
