    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if heat therapy intervention via hot water immersion
      (i.e., a hot tub) is an effective treatment for patients with Fibromyalgia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex and difficult-to-treat painful medical condition and is marked
      by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, decreased pain threshold, and comorbid
      symptomatology (e.g. fatigue, trouble thinking). Several factors appear to play a role in the
      pathophysiology of FM: abnormal pain processing, abnormal autonomic nervous and
      neuroendocrine system function, genetics, and environmental triggers. The prognosis for
      recovery in traditional medicine is generally poor and current pharmacological treatments for
      FM are often insufficient to control persistent symptoms. As such, complementary medicine and
      alternative lifestyle approaches are needed. Heat therapy, such as saunas and hot tubs, has
      been used historically for its presumed therapeutic benefits, and emerging research
      highlights the benefits of heat therapy on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risks.
      Finnish saunas, which result in total-body heating, have shown beneficial clinical effects
      for rheumatic patients and new studies are needed to determine if heat therapy could improve
      pain symptoms in patients with FM.

      The short-term goal of the investigators is to determine, in a pilot clinical study, that
      heat therapy intervention via hot water immersion is a safe and efficacious treatment for
      pain in patients with FM. The overall hypothesis is that heat therapy intervention will
      improve clinical pain severity and associated dysfunction in a cohort of FM patients and that
      the anti-inflammatory actions of heat shock proteins may mediate this improvement. The
      proposed interdisciplinary study will provide data regarding treatment efficacy and will
      explore potential molecular and physiologic processes that may underlie improvement in pain
      symptoms after heat therapy intervention for FM. Furthermore, these key pilot studies will
      provide important preliminary data for future studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Visual Numerical Pain Score (VNS) at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI scores are a numerical rating scale and range from 0 to 10. A score of 0 is equal to no pain and a score of 10 is equal to pain as bad as you can imagine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) measures to be included are Depression, Anxiety, Physical Functioning, and Sleep Impairment. Each questionnaire usually has 4-16 response options ranging in value from one to five. The total raw score for a short form with all questions answered is the sum of the values of the response to each question. The total range of potential raw scores depends on the number of questions being asked, for example, a 6 item form would have a range from is 6 to 30. After the raw score is calculated, a T-score metric is used to convert the raw score to a T-score. On the T-score metric, a score of 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation of that mean. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals &quot;more of the concept being measured&quot;, this could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending on the concept being measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) is a measure of symptom severity in fibromyalgia. There is a total of 21 questions and a range of scores from 0 to 210. The higher the score the more severe a person's symptoms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)-- Pressure pain sensitivity by Multimodal Automated Sensory Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain sensitivity is measured by the Multimodal Automated Sensory Testing (MAST) System (measured at the thumbnail). It yields a pressure pain threshold value measured in kg/cm2.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Analyses of Change in Baseline Heat Shock Proteins at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Heat shock proteins including Heat Shock Protein 72 (HSP72), Heat Shock Factor 25 (HSP25), and Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) will be measured via Western blots and Elisa assays in serum at baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention (within 48 hours of completion of the one month heat therapy intervention). Each of these specific heat shock proteins is measured as a protein to total protein ratio. For example, HSP25 is measured as HSP25/total protein.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Analyses of Change in Pro/Anti-inflammatory Markers at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Pro/Anti-Inflammatory markers (IL-1Ra, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IFN-α, TNF-α) will be measured via Western blots and Elisa assays in serum at baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention (within 48 hours of completion of the protocol). All markers will be measured as concentrations (nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL))</description>
