  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vertebral column represents the most common bony site for metastasis with an incidence
      ranged from 30% to 70% in patients with metastatic neoplasms. The dorsal spine carries the
      highest frequent site for metastasis all over the vertebral column followed by the lumber
      spine. These metastatic lesions are clinical entities that often necessitate a complex spinal
      decompression and anterior reconstruction. Posterolateral approaches alone allow for
      excellent decompression with transpedicular fixation and safe visualization of the neural
      elements for corpectomy and reconstruction so the investigators can avoid the complications
      that can be happened with the staged surgery.

      Purpose: investigators' aim in the study is to report cases and evaluate investigators'
      approach for fixation and assess the postoperative period regarding pain improvement and
      neurological deficit.

      At neurosurgery department in Sohag faculty of medicine, Between August 2014 and August 2017,
      26 patients with single dorsolumbar metastatic spinal lesions with vertebral body collapse
      underwent a single-stage, circumferential corpectomy and anterior spinal reconstruction with
      a pyramesh titanium cage via a midline, posterior and lateral approach. Investigators
      included in the study patients with retropulsed fragment inside the canal that causes spinal
      cord compression with neurological manifestation. Metastatic work up was done for cases.
      Exclusion criteria include patients with more than one spinal metastases or extra-spinal
      metastasis, patients with other comorbidities as cardiac ill patients, patients with chronic
      renal failure and patients who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy within one year before
      surgery. A preoperative neurological assessment, full laboratory investigations were done.
      Investigators used the Quebec scale to assess the patients' improvement regarding pain, and
      muscle power scale to evaluate the motor.
