      Introduction: Postural control is a crucial factor for maintaining balance while standing and
      walking. The shoe has a role to play in postural stability.

      Objectives: To evaluate the static balance of subjects when barefoot and when using three
      types of footwear with their eyes closed or open.

      Each participant was asked to focus on a white mark 2 cm in diameter, positioned on a screen
      2 m in front of them at eye level. This was done to standardize the data collection and
      minimize any variation in postural stability caused by changes in the visual field. Each
      participant was asked to remain in this position for a period of 30 seconds, while the data
      was collected. Three repetitions were made for each condition to obtain an average value. The
      condition on footwear and open / closed eyes was randomized to reduce the learning effect. On
      the other hand to reduce fatigue, each participant was allowed to rest for 5 minutes between
      shoe changes.

      The size of the sample was calculated with the software of the Clinical Epidemiology and
      Biostatistics Unit. Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruña. University of A Coruña
      (www.fisterra.com). The estimated sample size estimated was calculated to be at least 16
      subjects.
