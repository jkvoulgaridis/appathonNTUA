  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Political and civil instability in Pakistan has placed many segments of society under stress.
      A 5-session group intervention incorporating principles of stress management, problem
      solving, behavioural activation, peer-support and adaptive leadership has been developed and
      successfully piloted for business professionals working under stressful conditions in
      Pakistan. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted version of the
      intervention in improving psychological well-being amongst a group of trainee civil servants
      in the country.

      A two-arm single blind, randomised controlled trial of the group intervention will be
      conducted among trainee civil servants in Pakistan. The participants are newly inducted civil
      servants (n=240) undergoing a 6 months' induction training. The participants will be
      randomised on a 1:1 allocation ratio (120 in each arm), with the intervention arm receiving
      the group intervention integrated into their orientation sessions and the control arm
      receiving orientation sessions alone. Outcome assessments will be conducted immediately
      post-intervention and 3 months after the completion of the intervention. The primary outcomes
      will be change in the prevalence of psychological distress as measured by Patient Health
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and improvement in coping strategies as measured by Brief Cope
      Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of anxiety (measured by Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7)), well-being (measured by WHO5 well-being index) and
      psychological capital (measured by Psychological Capital Questionnaire).

      The primary analyses will be intent-to-treat consisting of all participants included,
      according to the groups in which they will be randomized. The primary analysis will involve
      comparing pre to post changes in prevalence of psychological distress and coping strategies
      of the participants randomly assigned to the two conditions, using Fisher's exact test.
      Primary analyses will be non-parametric tests; however sensitivity analyses will use
      parametric models such as linear and logistic regression to control for baseline values of
      the participants' characteristics.

      Ethical principles of voluntary informed consent, maintaining anonymity and confidentiality,
      data management and storage will be followed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>One of the primary end points is the prevalence of psychological distress at 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>One of the primary outcomes is change in the prevalence of psychological distress as measured by PHQ-9 in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other key major depressive symptoms (Kroenke et al, 2001). Participants rate their responses on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from not at all to nearly every day. The PHQ-9 total severity score ranges from 0 to 27. Higher score represents high psychological distress. The PHQ-9 has been validated in the Urdu language, showing adequate sensitivity and specificity (Husain et al 2006) and has been used in recent studies in KP (Rahman et al, 2016).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief COPE</measure>
    <time_frame>Another primary end point is the improvement in coping strategies at 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Another primary outcome is improvement in coping strategies measured by Brief COPE in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) is used to assess state coping (the way people cope with a specific stressful situation) and trait coping (the usual way people cope with stress in everyday life). It consists of 14 subscales i.e. active coping, planning, positive reframing, acceptance, humour, religion, use of emotional support, use of instrumental support, self-distraction, denial, venting, substance use, behavioral disengagement, and self-blame, with two items per sub-scale. The standard is to use sub-scale score. The score on each subscales ranges from 2 to 8. Higher score represents that person using the specific coping style a lot. Cronbach's alphas for the Brief COPE sub-scales range from 0.50 to 0.90 (Mayer, 2001).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>The secondary outcome data will be collected at 1 week post intervention and at 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological capital will be measured using the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ) 12 items version (Avey et al, 2007). The PCQ-12 measures psychological capital across four domains (hope-4 items, optimism-2 items, resilience -3 items and self-efficacy-3 items). The participants rate their responses on 6 point likert scale. The total score ranges from 12-72. Higher scores represents higher psychological capital.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>The secondary outcome data will be collected at 1 week post intervention and at 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7 will be used to measure anxiety (Spitzer et al, 2006) in the study sample. GAD-7 is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version IV (DSM IV) diagnostic criteria for generalised anxiety disorder, and has 7 items. Each item is scored on a likert scale from 0 to 3, generating a maximum score of 21. High score represents presence of anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>WHO-5 well-being index (WHO-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>The secondary outcome data will be collected at 1 week post intervention and at 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Well-being will be measured by WHO 5 Well-being index (Topp, et al, 2015). WHO-5 is a short and generic global rating scale measuring subjective well-being, the respondent is asked to rate how well each of the 5 statements applies to him or her when considering the last 14 days. The instrument will be administered to study participants at 3 months post intervention to rate their subjective well being in last 14 days. Each of the 5 items is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The raw score ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximal well-being). Scores are then converted to a percentage scale from 0 (absent) to 100 (maximal). Higher scores represent greater psychological well-being.</description>

    <description>A number of psycho-social skills development workshops will be conducted for newly inducted civil servants, based on the problem management plus intervention. Problem Management Plus is a brief low-intensity, trans-diagnostic psychological intervention that helps with existing psychological problems as well as building resilience against future adversity. It addresses a range of psychological and practical problems that participants identify as relevant to their lives, including common mental health problems (WHO, 2016; Dawson, et al., 2015). The workshops will be integrated into the routine induction sessions for trainee civil servants.</description>

    <description>5 weekly, psycho-social skills development workshops will be conducted for newly inducted civil servants in groups, based on the problem management plus intervention. These workshops will be integrated into routine induction sessions of trainee civil servants. Workshop 1 orients participants to the intervention with motivational interviewing techniques to improve engagement, teaches the difference between technical and adaptive challenges, and trains participants in a basic stress management strategy. Workshop 2 addresses a participant-selected problem using problem-solving techniques and introduces behavioral activation. Workshops 3 and 4 support participants' continued application of problem solving, behavioral activation, and stress management and introduce strategies to strengthen social support networks whenever required. In Workshop 5, education about retaining intervention gains are provided and all learned strategies are reviewed.</description>
