    <textblock>
      This study is an extension to Study ALT-103-201, a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NasoVAX in healthy
      adults 18 to 49 years of age.

    <textblock>
      This study is an extension to Study ALT-103-201 to evaluate immunogenicity of NasoVAX
      administered by intranasal spray at a single dose of 1×1011 vp at Day 366 (± 60 days). Up to
      15 subjects who received NasoVAX at the 1×10(11th) vp dose in Study ALT-103-201 will be
      screened, and a serum sample will be collected from each eligible subject for evaluation of
      influenza HAI assay against influenza A/California/07/2009(H1N1), a strain homologous to the
      one used for NasoVAX (monovalent AdcoCA09.HA). Ad5 antibody neutralization assay may also be
      performed.
