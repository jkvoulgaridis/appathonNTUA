  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 10 % of women who receive prenatal care at
      Instituto Nacional de Perinatología (Mexico, City). Currently, there is clear evidence on the
      utility of self- monitoring of capillary glucose (SMGC) to evaluate the efficacy of
      medical-nutrition therapy on glycemic control. However, the reports regarding the best
      pattern of SMGC in terms of frequency and number of determinations per day are limited. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two SMGC schemes for monitoring
      glycemic control in Mexican women with GDM.

    <textblock>
      Currently, the evidence from randomized clinical trials about the most appropriate scheme of
      SMGC for monitoring the glycemic control among women with GDM is limited. This study was
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of two different schemes of SMGC in GDM Mexican population,
      it is an open-label randomized clinical trial including 2 groups: group 1 (SMGC 4 times/day)
      measured in fasting and 1 hour postprandial of breakfast, lunch and dinner; group 2 (SMGC 2
      times/day), measured preprandial and 1 hour postprandial, of breakfast, lunch or dinner,
      alternating the meal each day, from GDM diagnosis until the resolution of pregnancy.
      Additionally, determinations of insulin, lipids and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be
      determinate at enrollment, and between the 30-32 and 36-38 of gestation week. The primary
      outcome: To compare the proportion of women who achieve glycemic control using SMGC 4
      times/day versus SMGC 2 times/day.

      Secondary outcome: To compare the risk of new-born large for gestational age, gestational
      hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, cesarean section, new-born weight, neonatal
      hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and entry to neonatal intensive care between
      groups. An analysis for intention of treatment will be made according to the recommendations
      of the CONSORT guidelines.
