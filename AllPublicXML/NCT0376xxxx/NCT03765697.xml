  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to evaluate the local and systemic safety profile and the analgesic
      efficacy of long-term treatment with lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Lido-Patch).

      The study was an open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, Phase III study and comprised a
      main and an extension period. 161 participants who completed treatment in KF10004/01
      (NCT03745404) and 98 newly recruited participants were enrolled.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main period was performed in 34 sites in 12 European countries (259 participants).
      Treatment duration was up to 12 months. All participants applied lidocaine 5% medicated
      plaster (containing 700 mg lidocaine per plaster) topically at the site of the skin affected
      by painful PHN. Depending on the size of the affected skin area, up-to 3 plasters were
      simultaneously applied for up to 12 hours per day (with a plaster-free interval of at least
      12 hours). Study objectives of the main period were to evaluate the local and systemic safety
      profile and the analgesic efficacy of lidocaine 5% medicated plaster, and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and its metabolite 2,6-xylidine in the target population after
      multiple administrations of lidocaine 5% medicated plaster by means of population kinetics.
      The study results were planned to be evaluated descriptively.

      102 participants who were satisfied with the treatment in the main study period entered the
      open-label extension period with continued treatment. 27 sites in 12 countries participated
      in the extension period. Enrollment in the extension period coincided with last visit of the
      main period of the study. Treatment duration was up to 4.4 years in the extension period. The
      objective of the extension period was to evaluate the long-term local and systemic safety
      profile and the long-term analgesic efficacy of treatment with lidocaine 5% medicated plaster
      in the subpopulation who had completed 12 months of treatment in the open-label main study
      period.

    <time_frame>After 1, 6, 12, 18, 26, 34, 42, and 52 weeks (or early withdrawal)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was assessed starting 1 week (new participants) or 6 weeks after treatment initiation (participants from KF10004/01) until the final visit of the main study period. The average pain relief during the last week before the visit was assessed using a 6-item verbal rating scale (VRS) with categories 1 = worse, 2 = no pain relief, 3 = slight, 4 = moderate, 5 = a lot, and 6 = complete.</description>

    <description>The participant's recall of worst, least, and average pain intensity in the last week prior to each visit were assessed using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine).</description>

    <description>Treatment emergent adverse events were continually monitored for or asked about at each visit scheduled every 6 months in the extension period. The extension period lasted for up to 4.4 years and included a follow-up visit (1-2 weeks after last regular 6-month visit [or early withdrawal]).

    <description>Allodynia severity was rated using the following categorical scale: 0 = no pain or discomfort to touch; 1 = uncomfortable, but tolerable to touch; 2 = painful; 3 = extremely painful, participant cannot stand touching. The test was conducted by means of a brush (type N12). The painful PHN area was stroked with the brush and the intensity of allodynic pain was assessed by the participant.</description>

    <time_frame>At 26 weeks of treatment in the main study period and at the final visit (at 52 weeks, or early withdrawal)</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators were asked to describe their overall impression of the change of the participant's condition/pain by answering the following question: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project, how much has he/she changed?&quot; The categorical scale comprises the categories not assessed = 0, very much improved = 1, much improved = 2, minimally improved = 3, no change = 4, minimally worse = 5, much worse = 6, and very much worse = 7.</description>

    <description>The Short Form 36 Quality of Life Index (SF-36 [Trade Mark]) standard version with a 4-week recall period was used as a self-assessment.
Eleven questions were answered on binomial (Yes/No) or on 3-, 5-, or 6-point categorical scales to generate the 8 raw scales (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health). Higher values of the raw scales represent a better outcome. The raw scales were converted into a transformed scale (transformed scale = [(actual raw score - lowest possible raw score) / possible raw score range] x 100).</description>

    <description>The SF-MPQ includes 15 words (11 sensory, 4 affective). Each word or phrase is rated on a 4-point intensity scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). In addition, the 6-point Present Pain Intensity (PPI) rating (no pain, mild, discomforting, distressing, horrible, excruciating) is included as is a visual analogue scale for rating pain intensity. Total score as well as sensory and affective sub-scores were calculated.</description>
