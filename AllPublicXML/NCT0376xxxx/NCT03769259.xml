  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal for the proposed project is to test the effectiveness of BCBT for the
      prevention of suicide attempts in a sample of treatment-seeking Marines. The standard null
      hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing improvement following BCBT (treatment
      duration of 12 weeks) to Person-Centered Therapy (PCT). The primary outcome comparisons will
      include direct markers of suicidality (i.e. suicide, suicide attempts). Secondary outcomes
      will be suicide ideation and indicators of psychiatric distress (e.g., depression,
      hopelessness). We also aim to assess several hypothesized psychological and neurocognitive
      mediators of treatment effects (e.g., wish to live, attentional bias, emotion regulation).
      Participants will be followed for 2 years posttreatment by independent evaluators blind to
      treatment condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of suicides by military personnel has steadily increased since 2004, especially in
      the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and has remained high despite a relative decline during 2014.
      Previous research conducted with active duty Army personnel supports the superiority of BCBT
      and its components over treatment as usual for the reduction of suicide attempts. Additional
      research is needed to determine if these effects are generalizable to the U.S. Marine Corps
      and to confirm hypothesized mechanisms of action. Reference to &quot;active duty&quot; refers to U.S.
      military service members that have been activated and deployed as a part of Operation Iraqi
      Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) in accordance with federal orders under Title 10
      or 32, United States Code.

      Specific Aim 1:To replicate previous findings supporting the efficacy of BCBT for the
      prevention of suicide attempts among active duty Marines (regardless of Axis I or II
      diagnosis). The standard null hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing improvement
      following BCBT to Present-Centered Therapy (PCT)

      Specific Aim 2: To identify cognitive-affective mediators of BCBT's effects on risk for
      suicide attempt.

    <description>The change in number of suicide attempts from baseline will be assessed through review of participants' medical records and through participants' responses to the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview. The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview is a structured interview assessing history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, including suicide attempt history (dates, methods, and severity (e.g., need for medical attention) of previous suicide attempts). An increased number of suicide attempts at any assessment is considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed once per week until completion of treatment (average of 12 weeks) and at every 3 months through study completion (average of 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation is a 21-item self-report measure of the severity of current suicidal ideation. Items 1-19 measure current suicidal ideation, with summed total scores for these items ranging from 0-38. Higher scores are associated with more severe suicidal ideation and are considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants in BCBT receive 12 outpatient individual psychotherapy sessions scheduled on a weekly or biweekly basis, with the first session lasting 90 minutes and subsequent sessions lasting 60 minutes. BCBT was is delivered in three sequential phases. In phase I (5 sessions), the therapist identifies patient-specific factors that contribute to and maintain suicidal behaviors, provides a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization, collaboratively develops a crisis response plan, and teaches basic emotion regulation skills. In phase II (5 sessions), the therapist applies cognitive strategies to reduce beliefs and assumptions that serve as vulnerabilities to suicidal behavior. In phase III (2 sessions), a relapse prevention task is conducted.</description>

    <description>Participants in PCT will receive will include 12 outpatient individual psychotherapy sessions scheduled on a weekly or biweekly basis, with the first session lasting 90 minutes and subsequent sessions lasting 60 minutes. PCT consists of (1) psychoeducation about the typical symptoms and features associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors among military personnel; (2) normalization of symptoms; (3) experience of receipt of support and feedback from a licensed professional; and (4) positive interpersonal interactions.</description>
