  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nudge is a set of methods aimed at helping people adopt a behavior by a gentle prompt,
      conscious or not. Classically, Nudges rely on heuristics and cognitive biases. These methods
      have been studied for years in social psychology and are receiving renewed attention since
      the awarding of the Nobel Prize in economics to Richard Thaler for his work on the
      application of Nudge to the economy.

      Health professionals are very inadequately vaccinated (25 to 45% of the population). Some
      studies have shown that a Nudge based on intent implementation can significantly increase
      vaccination coverage. However, few studies evaluate the acceptability of Nudge or its
      application to health professionals.

      The investigators sought to apply a Nudge based on availability heuristics to health
      professionals, in order to evaluate its effectiveness and terms of behavior adoption
      (influenza vaccination) and its acceptability.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that Nudging is both effective and acceptable and that
      people found nudging more acceptable if they have been exposed to a nudge.

      The investigators asked residents in general medicine to pass a questionnaire including a
      Nudge. This Nudge was the influenza vaccine prescription form accompanied on the back of the
      telephone numbers of the occupational health centers of the hospitals where residents were on
      probation.

      The interns of the group &quot;Nudge&quot; saw at the end of their questionnaire the following
      statement: &quot;If you are not vaccinated against the flu so far, you can get the form stapled to
      this questionnaire, it will allow you to get the vaccine in pharmacy. On the back you will
      also find practical information about immunization services at your place of training. &quot; A
      group will receive an implemented Nudge questionnaire, a group will receive a questionnaire
      without Nudge and a control group will not be asked. (Phase 1) The 3 groups will receive a
      month later a questionnaire evaluating the effectiveness in terms of immunization coverage,
      and the acceptability of the Nudge, for oneself and for others. (Phase 2) The control group
      will only receive the Phase 2 questionnaire to control the Hawthorne effect.

      The difference between the 3 groups will consist exclusively in the exposure of the
      participants to:

        -  A questionnaire on their attitude (opinion) towards vaccination;

        -  The numbers of the occupational health vaccination centers of their places of training;

        -  The flu vaccine prescription form, to be signed and stamped by a doctor (also already
           freely available on the internet)
