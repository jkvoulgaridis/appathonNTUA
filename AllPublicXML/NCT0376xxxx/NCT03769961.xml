    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to characterize ataxia occurring in essential tremor and essential
      tremor with DBS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: In recent years, there has been a growing amount of evidence tying Essential
      Tremor (ET) to cerebellar dysfunction. This has been clinically observed, demonstrated
      through specific gait measures of ataxia (often involving tandem gait), and confirmed through
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Deep Brain stimulation for ET has become a widely
      utilized therapeutic intervention for patients, and the bilateral thalamic ventralis
      intermedius (VIM) is most commonly implanted. However, it has been noted that in some
      patients gait ataxia significantly worsens post-op. This initially was thought to be a result
      of disease progression, but recent studies have in fact shown that this is a DBS related
      phenomenon.

      Methods: Participants will have two visits to either the Portland VA or Oregon Health &amp;
      Science University (OHSU). At each visit, several assessments of balance, tremor, gait and
      balance, and DBS settings will be made. The gait and balance assessments will be performed by
      a unblinded and a blinded rater.

    <description>Compare the Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) total score between DBS and no DBS participants with essential tremor. This 8-item scale rates gait (0-8 points), stance (0-6 points), sitting (0-4 points), speech disturbance (0-6 points), finger chase (0-4 points), nose-finger test (0-4 points), fast alternating hand movements (0-4 points), and heel-shin slide (0-4 points). Motor activists of the four extremities (items 5-8) assessments are performed bilaterally, mean values to obtain a total score. Cumulative score ranges from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia).</description>

    <measure>Balance Confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (after DBS has been turned off for 3-10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) is a subjective measure of confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling or experiencing a sense of unsteadiness. The ABC scale is a 16-item self-report measure in which participants rate their balance confidence on a 0-100 scale (0 = 0 no confidence, 100 = 100 complete confidence). Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and dividing by the total number of items.</description>

    <ipd_description>Post data entry and verification, data and specimens will be de-identified (no 18 HIPAA identifiers and age aggregated for those &gt; 89 years old) and transferred to the Neurological Disorder Repository (MIRB # 3129). This repository is maintained at the Portland VA Health Care System. Verification of the coded data set creation and the absence of the identifiers will be created and retained in the study files. The research coordinator will be responsible for the creation and verification process. The key to the code will be maintained by the study and will not be released to the repository. The recipient investigator must present the data use agreement, documentation of an Institutional Review Boar (IRB) approved protocol and Informed Conset Form (ICF) allowing the release of the identifiable specimens/data, or the release of coded specimens/data.</ipd_description>
