    <textblock>
      The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is the outcome measure of choice in England and Wales
      for National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). To be able to conduct a cost
      utility analysis, QALY data is required. This can either be collected within trial or
      published data can be used.

      In the United Kingdom (UK) there is no up to date QALY data for women with early breast
      cancer treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy. The OSTaRa Study aims to provide up to
      date QALY data for women in this cohort.

    <description>Each subject will complete an EQ5D questionnaire, to allow Quality of Life to be calculated. The EQ5D uses a Likert scale which assesses five states (mobility, self care, usual care, pain and discomfort and anxiety and depression) at five different levels - none, slight, moderate, severe or unable to perform. Levels are coded 1-5 and a total score is then generated. Results for the demographic measured will be displayed as a percentage value.</description>
