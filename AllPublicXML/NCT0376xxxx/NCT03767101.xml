  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Evidence have suggested that persons with mental disorders show a dysfunctional
      upregulation of negative affect but at the same time a dysfunctional downregulation of
      positive affect. Nevertheless positive affect in patients or treatment processes is barely
      researched. Experimental paradigms with healthy and subclinical populations have shown that
      induced positive affects leads to higher flexibility in information processing, cognitive
      appraisal and action tendencies. Higher amounts of positive affect were associated with more
      personal resources, higher psychological resilience and subjective well-being. A small body
      of research have indicated that a focus on positive and functional aspects in the life of
      patients lead to better treatment sessions and outcome. However, the role of positive affect
      for the process in cognitive behavioral therapy remains unclear.

      Method/Design: In regard to this we developed the PACIfIC-study, serving two major
      objectives:

        -  To develop and test the feasibility of a brief, audio-tape presented mental imagery
           intervention, that is used at the beginning of individual treatment sessions to induce
           positive affect.

        -  To review the effects of this positive intervention on the therapeutic process between
           and within sessions in comparison to another active mental imagery condition and a
           control condition.

      The study includes a randomized contolled, longitudinal design in a outpatient treatment
      center. The interventions are conducted in the first eight therapeutic sessions of each
      treatment and are used in a patient sample with various mental disorders. Outcomes were
      raised by self-rating questionnaires and video-analysis of treatment sessions.

      Discussion: The study results could have important theoretical and practical implications on
      the use of positive affect in psychotherapeutic treatment. Furthermore an economic
      implementation of brief positive and resource-oriented interventions in general practice
      could be initiated.

    <description>In all conditions the first eight sessions of treatment are focused. All of this sessions start with a brief, audio-tape presented positive mental imagery intervention (duration about six minutes). In this intervention patients are guided to imagine a happy, positive situation within the last seven days. Patients get the instruction to imagine from a field perspective, exploring various sensory modalities and feelings in that specific moment. Patients perform this task in the rooms of the treatment center together with their therapists. The text of the mental imagery intervention is standardized and spoken by Prof. Dr. Ulrike Willutzki. Directly before and after the imagination patients are asked on their mood with a single-item. After the short intervention patients are instructed to communicated the content of their imagination with their therapists for about one minute. After completion the regular cognitive behavioral therapy session begins.</description>

    <description>In all three treatment arms, licensed therapists/trainee therapists perform a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) under conditions of the German health care system. All treatments are based on individualized treatment plans for each patient. Therapists are supervized by an CBT expert therapist in the outpatient treatment center. On average every forth session is supervized. The total duration of treatment is variable, oriented on patients symptoms and treatment goals.</description>
