  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with advanced malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is composed of two stages: Part 1 Accelerated Titration Phase and Part 2 Dose
      Escalation Phase with initial fixed priming dose.

      The starting dose for part 1 is 0.1 mg/kg QW, followed by 2 dose cohorts (0.3 mg/kg QW and 1
      mg/kg QW). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 28 days.

      Part 2 will have 4 dose cohorts(3mg/kg QW、10mg/kg QW、20mg/kg QW and 30mg/kg QW). Conventional
      3+3 Dose Escalation will be adopted. DLT observation period is 28 days.

             coagulation and clotting disorders), psychiatric, psychological, familial or
             geographical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, may interfere with
             the planned staging, treatment and follow-up, affect subject compliance or place the
             subject at high risk from treatment-related complications.

         21. Known history of hypersensitivity to any components of the IBI188 product.
