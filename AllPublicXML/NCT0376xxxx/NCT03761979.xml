    <textblock>
      No clinical trials have evaluated strontium L-lactate (SrLac), the strontium salt of the
      L-enantiomer of lactic acid. Therefore, this clinical study was conducted to obtain general
      safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) information following acute oral intakes of three doses of
      SrLac by healthy adults. The data provided valuable comparisons with the pharmacokinetics of
      other strontium salts that are in clinical use and allowed determination of the dose of SrLac
      that will be useful for the management of bone health.neficial for the treatment of low bone
      density of osteoporosis and osteopenia.

      Purpose: The aim of this clinical study was to obtain safety and pharmacokinetic information
      following acute oral intakes of three ascending doses of strontium L-lactate by healthy
      adults.

      Subjects and methods: Ten healthy men and women, mean age 43 ± 2 years, ingested one of three
      ascending doses of strontium L-lactate (SrLac) once per week for three weeks in succession.
      Fasting blood collections were performed pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 hours
      post-dose for determination of serum strontium at each interval.

    <description>The Sponsor provided each 170 mg dose of strontium as strontium L-lactate dry powder packaged in individual vials. The powder was prepared for consumption by adding 10 mL of distilled water to the vial and stirring until dissolution was complete. This liquid was then poured into an administration cup. An additional 10 mL of distilled water was used to rinse the remaining SrLac into the administration cup. Then 80 mL of distilled water was added directly into the administration cup. Following consumption of the 100 mL solution of SrLac, another 100 mL of distilled water was added into the administration cup, swirled, and consumed by the subject.</description>
