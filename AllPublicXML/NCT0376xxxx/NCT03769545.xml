    <textblock>
      Until a few years ago the only interventional option available for severe aortic stenosis was
      surgical aortic valve replacement. About a decade ago, a novel percutaneous technique was
      applied for the first time in humans, the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
      Initially this procedure was reserved for those patients deemed too high risk for surgical
      intervention. As technology progressed in this domain, the indication for TAVI expanded to a
      broader population of patient with severe aortic stenosis. To-date there are no long-term
      data for mortality and this is the central question this study will explore in correlation
      with haemodynamic parameters. Essentially, this study will explore the effect of TAVI in the
      long term. All patients that had a TAVI within the RBH&amp;HH NHS Foundation Trust between
      January 2008 and December 2017 will be included in the study. This is a retrospective study.

      Aortic valve stenosis is the most prevalent valvulopathy in the developed world countries.
      Until a few years ago the only interventional option available for severe aortic stenosis was
      surgical aortic valve replacement. About a decade ago, a novel percutaneous technique was
      applied for the first time in humans, the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a
      keyhole procedure. Initially this procedure was reserved for those patients deemed too high
      risk for surgical intervention. As technology progressed in this domain, the indication for
      TAVI expanded to a broader population of patient with severe aortic stenosis. As the
      experience broadens there are no long-term data for mortality and this is the central
      question this study will explore in correlation with haemodynamic parameters. Essentially,
      this study will explore the effect of TAVI in the long term. All patients that had a TAVI
      within the RBH&amp;HH NHS Foundation Trust between January 2008 and December 2017 will be
      included in the study. This is a retrospective study and will not change anything in the
      patients' standard of care.
