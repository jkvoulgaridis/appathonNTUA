  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and
      multiple subcutaneous doses of OLP-1002 in healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exploratory objectives of the study are to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of
      OLP-1002 following single subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers using a capsaicin pain
      model, and to monitor the effects of a single subcutaneous doses of OLP-1002 on cardiac QT
      interval. Where possible, single and/or multiple subcutaneous dose pharmacokinetics of
      OLP-1002 in healthy subjects will be determined.

          -  In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
             physical examination, single 12-lead electrocardiogram (resting heart rate &gt; 45 bpm
             and &lt; 90 bpm), vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory evaluations
             (congenital nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia [eg, suspicion of Gilbert's syndrome based
             on total and direct bilirubin] is not acceptable) at Screening as assessed by the
             Investigator (or designee).

          -  Willing to abide by the contraception requirements.

          -  Able to comprehend and willing to sign an Informed Consent Form and to abide by the
             study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic,
             dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, respiratory, endocrine, or psychiatric disorder, as
             determined by the Investigator (or designee).

          -  History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound,
             food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator (or designee).

               -  PR interval &gt; 220 ms confirmed by repeat measurement.

               -  findings which would make QT interval corrected for heart rate measurements
                  difficult or QT interval corrected for heart rate data uninterpretable.

               -  history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (eg, heart failure,

             have given their prior consent.

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to Check-in.
