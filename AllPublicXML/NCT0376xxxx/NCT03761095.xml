  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PTC596 in combination with dacarbazine for the treatment
      of advanced LMS and determine the overall safety profile of PTC596 in combination with
      dacarbazine.

      This study will employ the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) for dose
      finding. Treatment will be initiated at dose level 2 (DL2) (Dacarbazine 1000 milligrams per
      square meter [mg/m^2] intravenously (IV) every 21 days in combination with PTC596 200
      milligrams [mg] orally twice weekly) for the first participant. This dose level represents
      the investigator's best assessment of the MTD based on available toxicity data for both
      agents. For subsequent participants, the dose level at which treatment is initiated will be
      selected based on the TITE-CRM using the most up to date dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      information from all participants previously treated.

      Treatment will continue for each participant until evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease
      progression, or treatment discontinuation for another reason (study intervention
      discontinuation and participant discontinuation/withdrawal).

             coadministration of fluvoxamine (an SSRI), as a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2, should not
             be used and an alternative agent selected. Fluvoxamine has the potential to inhibit
             the conversion of dacarbazine to its active metabolite. Note also that flovoxamine may
             increase the exposure to PTC596 which could enhance the neutropenic effects of PTC596.

             for non-melanoma skin cancer or adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ) during
             the 5 years prior to initiation. Cancer treated with curative intent more than 5 years
             previously and without evidence of recurrence is not an exclusion.

         37. Prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical or psychiatric condition,
             medical history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in
             the investigator's opinion, could affect the safety of the participant, or alter the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drugs, or could impair
             the assessment of study results.

         38. History of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease at any time in participant's
             history, including treated central nervous system (CNS) disease which is clinically
             and radiographically stable.
