      The aim of this study was to explore the effect of neural therapy on postoperative pain and
      discomfort such as abdominal swelling; and gynecologic symptoms such as dysmenorrhea,
      dyspareunia, amount of menstrual bleeding and vaginitis. It also aimed to find out any
      possible links between the clinical changes and pathophysiologic mechanisms. One hundred and
      thirteen patients were randomly divided into two groups (neural therapy and control).
      Postoperative first day, neural therapy was applied to the T10 to S4 dermatomes and
      utero-vaginal ganglion in random with local anesthetic agent. All patients were recalled one
      year after the treatment. The visual analog scale (VAS) were noted in both groups, also
      discomfort and gynecologic symptoms are recorded.
