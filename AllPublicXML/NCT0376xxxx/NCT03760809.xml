  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is one of the most common pediatric surgeries, and agitation
      and severe postoperative pain have been considered a very common complications.
      Dexmedetomidine mainly inhibits the release of norepinephrine by acting on the α-adrenergic
      receptor of the brainstem nucleus, which can produce good sedative effects. Hydromorphone has
      a longer duration of action than fentanyl, and it also has a certain sedative effect. The
      combination of the two is more conducive to the management of postanesthetic agitation and
      pain. This study was to compare the effect of different doses of dexmedetomidine combined
      with hydromorphone in the sedation and analgesia after pediatric tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy.

      The computer generates random numbers to allocate patients into different group. Trained
      research staff who are not involved in the study collect the data. The treating clinicians
      are not blinded to the assignment group.

      The primary measurement are pain scores, PAED scores, coughing score ( a 4-point scale:1= no
      coughing,2=minimal coughing, one or two times, 3= moderate coughing,3-4 times, 4 = severe
      coughing, more than 5 times), and extubation time. The secondary measurements are the time to
      discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit, and the number of postoperative desaturation.

      A sample size of 30 was determined by analysis based on the assumption of the decline of
      extubation time from other similar study and α=0.05,β=0.2.

      The continuous variables were presented as means ± SD and the categorical variables were
      expressed as frequency.

      The outcome of interest is extubation time decline.

    <description>pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scores included five behaviors:(1)makes eye contact with caregiver,(2) actions are purposeful,(3) aware of surroundings,(4) restless,(5) inconsolable.
Each behavior was correlated to different degree(4= not at all,3= just a little, 2= quite a bit, 1= very much,0= extremely). The scores for each of the five listed behaviors are added to achieve a total score (maximum score of 20, minimum score of 0). A score of &gt;12 is diagnosed to agitation.</description>
