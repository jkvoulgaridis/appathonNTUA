      The objective of this study is to provide preliminary evidence for the safety and
      effectiveness of the AblaCare Kit in transvaginal ablation of ovarian tissue under ultrasound
      visualization in women with infertility due to polycystic ovary syndrome.

    <intervention_name>AblaCare Kit</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention consists in the realisation of the AblaCare Procedure using the AblaCare Kit, which comprises two elements: a disposable device (AblaCare Device) and a radiofrequency (RF) energy generator (AblaCare System). The AblaCare Device is a short-term invasive device delivered and positioned through the vagina to deliver RF energy inside the ovary in order to ablate ovarian tissue.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Candidates for this study must meet ALL of the following criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for female participants:

          -  Anovulatory infertility associated with PCOS

          -  Age: ≥ 18 to ≤ 40 years

          -  Diagnostic transvaginal ultrasound to validate ultrasonographic evidence of PCOS
             (ovarian volume ≥ 10ml and/or follicle number per ovary of ≥ 20)

          -  Ovarian accessibility: determined by ability to bring transvaginal ultrasound
             transducer into close proximity to ovaries

          -  Evidence of hyperandrogenaemia: either clinical (hirsutism or acne) or biochemical
             (raised serum concentration of androgens (testosterone ≥ 2.5nmol/l, or FAI &gt; 4)

          -  Failure of first-line pharmacological treatment defined as:

               -  failure to ovulate on highest dose of first line pharmacological treatment, OR

               -  failure to conceive on appropriate dose of first line pharmacological treatment
                  for at least six cycles, OR

               -  discontinuation of first-line pharmacological treatment due to side-effects.

          -  At least one patent tube and normal uterine cavity as determined by sonohysterogram,
             hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy/laparoscopy within the last 3 years

          -  Willing to comply with protocol-specified follow-up evaluation

          -  Signed informed consent

        Couple inclusion criteria:

          -  Normal sperm parameters based on WHO 2000 criteria (concentration⩾ 15 million/mL,
             motility A+B ⩾ 32%, normal forms ⩾ 4%).

          -  No previous sterilization procedures

        Candidates will be excluded from the study if ANY of the following conditions apply:

          -  Current pregnancy

          -  Marked obesity, BMI &gt; 35

          -  Marked hyperandrogenism (FAI &gt; 15)

          -  Subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study
             that clinically interferes with the endpoints of this study

          -  Lack of capacity to give informed consent

          -  Previous ovarian surgery: LOD, endometriosis surgery, ovarian cysts surgery, patients
             with known or suspected periovarian adhesions.
