    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ORACLE Registry is to demonstrate clinical utility of the BDX-XL2 test;
      specifically, the potential to reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, such as biopsies and
      surgeries, on benign lung nodules while not significantly increasing the number of malignant
      lung nodules routed to CT surveillance. Clinical data will be collected from participating
      patients to evaluate the impact of the BDX-XL2 test when used in the clinical management of
      recently identified lung nodules assessed to have a low to moderate risk of cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has provided informed consent to participate in the registry and agrees to
             comply with all protocol requirements.

          2. Patient meets the criteria for the intended use population of the BDX-XL2 test:

               -  Patient is &gt; 40 years of age at the time of the discovery of the lung nodule of
                  concern.

               -  The maximal dimension of the patient's lung nodule of concern is &gt; 8mm and &lt;
                  30mm.

               -  The pre-test risk of cancer as determined by the Mayo risk prediction algorithm
                  is 50% or less.

          3. The first CT scan identifying the lung nodule of concern was performed within 3 months
             of patient enrollment in the registry. If beyond 3 months, a new CT within 3 months of
             patient enrollment must have been performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Nodule work-up before the time of patient enrollment indicating any attempted or
             completed biopsy procedure after the first CT scan identifying the lung nodule of
             concern.

          2. Current diagnosis of any active cancer.

          3. High risk per physician assessment.

          4. Prior diagnosis of any cancer within 2 years of lung nodule detection, except for
             non-melanoma skin cancer.

          5. Concurrent participation in any unrelated clinical trial that may impact or alter the
             management of the patient's nodule of concern.

          6. Any illness or factor that will prevent compliance with follow-up as recommended.
