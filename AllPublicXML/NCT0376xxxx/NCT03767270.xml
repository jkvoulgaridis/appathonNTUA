  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2, first-in-human study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      escalating doses of MRT5201 administered intravenously to subjects with OTC Deficiency
      (OTCD). This study will also evaluate the effect of a single dose of MRT5201 on metabolic
      markers of OTCD and ureagenesis; and determine an acceptable dosing interval of MRT5201.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a documented diagnosis of OTCD.

          -  Documented history of ≥1 symptomatic hyperammonemia event with ammonia ≥100 µmol/L

          -  Subject's OTCD is stable as evidenced by meeting the following criteria:

               -  Ammonia level &lt;175 µmol/L during the Screening Period and at Baseline (Day -1)

               -  No clinical symptoms of hyperammonemia during the Screening Period and at
                  Baseline (Day -1)

          -  If using nitrogen scavenger therapy, must be on a stable regimen for ≥28 days prior to
             signing informed consent

          -  Subject has maintained a stable protein restricted diet (which may or may not include
             medical foods) and/or amino acid supplementation with no changes in calorie or protein
             goals and no changes in medical food and/or amino acid supplementation for ≥ 28 days
             prior to signing informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any laboratory abnormality that may put the subject at increased risk by participating
             in this study.

          -  Have any significant concurrent or past medical condition that would represent an
             unacceptable risk to the subject or might jeopardize the collection of high-quality
             data from the study. These include but are not limited to:

               -  History of liver transplant, including hepatocyte therapy/transplant

               -  History of liver disease

               -  Positive viral serology test results for HIV type 1 or 2 antibodies, hepatitis B
                  surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody

               -  Type I or Type II diabetes that is poorly controlled, in the opinion of the
                  Investigator

               -  Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 150 mm
                  Hg or diastolic BP &gt; 90 mm Hg)

               -  Use of anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors, including but not limited to
                  heparin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Acetaminophen is
                  permitted

          -  Participation in previous clinical studies evaluating investigational OTCD therapies
             directed at expressing functional OTC protein (eg, OTC gene therapy studies, other
             mRNA replacement therapy) that has led to the presence of anti-OTC antibodies.
