  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examined the effects of dietary protein intake in a mixed meal at two
      levels of protein amount on whole body protein metabolisms in older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators determined the total anabolic response to an amount of protein intake
      commonly eaten with dinner (70g) as compared with the amount required to maximally stimulate
      muscle protein synthesis (35g). Men and women, ages &gt; 60 years will be studied under two
      levels of protein intake in mixed meals in random order (35g or 70g protein in isocaloric
      mixed meals). For two days prior to each stable isotope tracer study, subjects' dietary
      intake of calories and protein will be stabilized by providing subjects their entire diets.
      On the third day, a 8-hr metabolic study will be conducted in the UAMS Reynolds Institute on
      Aging (IOA) to determine the total anabolic response to the particular amount of beef intake,
      which will be repeated with the other amount of protein in mixed meal after a minimum 7-day
      washout interval. The investigators measured whole body protein kinetics, muscle fractional
      synthetic rate, and plasma amino acid profile.
