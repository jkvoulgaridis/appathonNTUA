      Retrospective study of the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients who
      experienced inadvertent trauma before diagnosis of retinoblastoma and to alert
      ophthalmologists to the possibility of RB in children presenting with or without
      trauma-related symptoms and signs.

    <description>We reviewed the computerized diagnostic records of consecutive patients with RB managed at the ocular oncology service of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2013 and August 2018. The charts of those patients who had undergone trauma before diagnosis of RB were selected. In addition, we identified the preschool-aged children (age 0-6 years) who underwent surgical treatment for ocular trauma at our hospital during the corresponding period. Then, we calculated the incidence of trauma among RB patients.</description>
