      Brief summary:

      This study will evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in
      schizophrenia with treatment resistant auditory hallucination

      Detailed description:

      Auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia disorders have been proposed to be associated
      with a source- monitoring deficit. The improvement of the monitoring deficit will have major
      impact on the improvement of hallucinatory symptoms and the social function. Brain network
      considered to play a major role in source monitoring is the default mode (DM) network. An
      increasing activity during the brain's resting phase and decreasing activity during
      stimulus-induced brain activity, increased rest activity in the primary auditory cortex which
      contributes to conditions, internal speech perceived as a tangible external sound, triggering
      the occurrence of verbal auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic disorders.

      This study will determine if

      1-Hz low-frequency, transcranial repetitive magnetic stimulus could be used to inhibit
      hyperconnectivity between these DM networks and other brain regions, allowing the
      source-monitoring capability to function properly. This study will measure the oscillatory
      strength and functional connectivity in the DM network via EEG resting-state activity in
      schizophrenic with auditory hallucinations before and after rTMS administration. With a
      seed-based analysis, using the region of interest (ROIs) in the posterior cortex area of the
      cortex (PPC), precuneus area (PCu), the inferior parietal area (IPC), the medial temporal
      (MT) area, the medial frontal area (MFC) and the singulatum cortex anterior (ACC) in
      bilateral hemispheres to create an EEG-based brain activity mapping, measuring cortical
      spectral power and functional connectivity in the ROIs.

      Before starting rTMS, participants will undergo : (1) general and psychiatric assessment, (2)
      neuropsychological test to evaluate hallucination and source-monitoring ability, (3) an EEG
      recording (which takes about 1 hour). After these assessment are completed, participants will
      be randomly assigned (by computer program) to receive either 1 Hz frequency rTMS or placebo
      stimulation for 20 minutes per day over a 10-day period. During this time, the participants
      will not know whether they received real or placebo TMS. For 10-days, stimulation will be
      administered to an area of the left temporal lobe of the brain (temporo-parietal junction).

      After trial is completed, participants will be told if they received real or placebo. If the
      participants have receive only place stimulation, they will then be offered a trial of real
      rTMS.

      TMS is not causing pain, but it can be uncomfortable due to a tingling or knocking sensation,
      contraction of scalp and facial muscles. There is also a small risk of seizure associated
      with TMS, but because of the lower frequency of stimulation used in this study (1 stimulation
      per second), this risk is significant only for participants who have a prior history of
      seizures, epilepsy, or other neurological problem. Investigators are also concerned that TMS
      may cause hearing problems. Therefore, investigators will carefully monitor participants for
      early signs of such problem, using hearing-safety aid to every stimulation session. If
      investigators suspect that a participant is experiencing problems with hearing, the trial is
      stopped.

Symptoms over the last week will rated. The dimensions of auditory hallucinations are: frequency, duration, location, loudness, beliefs about origin, negative content, intensity of negative content, amount of distress, intensity of distress, disruption of life and control. Investigators will measure hallucination score before and after 10 session TMS. Total score consist of averaged score of dimensions. A higher score represent a worse outcome.</description>

Participants will ask to distinguish word between 10 silent reading and 10 covert reading and 10 new non-presented word, before TMS and after 10 session TMS. Words are current Indonesian word extract from a verbal fluency task. During the test, word will be presented during 3 seconds on a computer screen.
To evaluate the source monitoring performance, investigators will consider source attribution, corresponding to number incorrect attribution for source. Score range is between 0-20 A higher total score represents a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>This study will investigate all frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) coherence in each region of interest of default-mode network. To examine whether functional connectivity between DMN structures differs before and after TMS, the average EEG time series for all nodes in each seed ROI will normalize using transformation and correlations will perform with all other seeds in the DMN network in a 9Ã—9 correlation matrix. The resulting correlation coefficients for each participant will then compare using a two-sided samples t-test to evaluate between-group differences in ROI-ROI connectivity for each seed. A score will represent a functional connectivity between ROIs</description>
