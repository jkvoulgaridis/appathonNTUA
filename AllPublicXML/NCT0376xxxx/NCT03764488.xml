  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the distribution in the central nervous
      system (CNS) of a microdose 99mTc-MAG3-BIIB067 co-administered with unlabeled BIIB067. The
      secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of unlabeled
      BIIB067 co-administered with a microdose of 99mTc-MAG3-BIIB067 to healthy participants.

    <measure>BIIB067 Concentrations Throughout the CNS</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 24 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>BIIB067 concentrations throughout the CNS will be estimated by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging of 99mTc-MAG3-BIIB067.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 91</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>

    <time_frame>1 to 24 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Dose of radiation absorbed (dosimetry) in specific regions of the CNS will be estimated by SPECT/CT imaging of 99mTc-MAG3-BIIB067.</description>

             lumbar puncture (LP), including but not limited to: (a) medication use that prolongs
             coagulation times, including aspirin; (b) known disorders of the coagulation cascade,
             platelet function, or platelet count; (c) low white blood cell counts; (d) chronic low
             back pain; (e) prior lumbar spine surgery; (f) anatomical factors at or near the LP
             site; (g) clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., headache, papilledema,
             or focal neurologic signs).

          -  Contraindications to radiation exposure for research purposes.

          -  Exposure to ionizing radiation within the last 12 months that would result in
