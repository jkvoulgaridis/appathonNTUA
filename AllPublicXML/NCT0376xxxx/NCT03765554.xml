  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-06700841 is a dual Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor that is being
      developed for oral treatment of adult patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).This
      open-label study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PF-06700841 following single oral
      doses of immediate release (IR) and modified release (MR) tablets in healthy, adult
      participants under fasted conditions. This is an open label, single dose, randomized, 2
      period, 2- sequence crossover study in a single cohort of approximately 8 (minimum 6) healthy
      participants.

             testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody

             product used in this study (whichever is longer).
