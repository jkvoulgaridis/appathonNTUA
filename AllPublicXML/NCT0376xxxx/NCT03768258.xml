      This current chart review study was designed to investigate the incidence of breast cancer in
      women treated with subcutaneous testosterone therapy for symptoms of hormone deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prior ten-year prospective, observational, study was initially approved in March of 2008 by
      the IRB board through the Atrium Medical Center, Premier Health Partners in Middletown, Ohio
      45005 and registered through the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). Expedited
      approval continued annually through 2013 at which time the IRB board was closed. All
      participants signed a study consent and HIPPA consent. Recruitment closed in 2013. The
      original protocol was designed to investigate the incidence of breast cancer in women
      presenting with symptoms of hormone deficiency treated with subcutaneous testosterone
      implants or, testosterone combined with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole implants. A
      computer program was specifically designed to track and follow patients prospectively and all
      patients continued to be followed through 2018.

        Women who presented to the office of Dr. Rebecca Glaser between March 2008- March of 2103
        with symptoms of hormone deficiency and received testosterone implant therapy were asked to
        participate in the study. This current chart review study will examine the 10-year
        incidence of breast cancer in women accrued to the study.
