  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the abdominal closure technique in emergency surgery. Half of
      participants will be perform the classic Large Stitch technique, while the other half will
      undergo the Small Stitch technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The closure of laparotomy is one of the most important challenges facing the surgeon.

      The classic technique of wall closure is the Large Stitch technique that uses monofilament
      double-strand sutures with a SL/WL (Suture Lengh/Wound Lengh) 4:1 ratio, with a distance to
      the alba line and between each stitch of 1 cm.

      Nowadays, the Small Stitch technique is accepted as the technique of choice for closure of
      laparotomies in programmed surgery. It is based on a very long-term monofilament absorbable
      synthetic suture of Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (Monomax) 2/0 with HR (Half-circle Round body) 26
      needle. Stitches should be given with a distance to the alba line of 0'5cm and 0'5 cm of
      separation between stitches.

      There are very few studies about the role of Small Stitch technique in the field of Emergency
      Surgery where the increased morbidity of the patient and the higher rate of surgical wound
      infection can play a fundamental role, and could be improved with the use of new abdominal
      wall closure techniques.

    <description>Patients requiring an urgent emergency laparotomy. The Small Stitch closure technique will be perform using a Monomax® 2/0 HR26 (Half-circle Round body):
It will be use a very long-term monofilament absorbable synthetic suture of Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (Monomax) 2/0 with HR 26 needle (Half-circle Round body).
In the technique should be given at least 2 points for each wound cm, with a distance to the alba line of 0'5cm and 0'5 cm of separation between stitches. The closure starts from both ends, ending in the middle of the laparotomy with an overlap of at least 2 cm. The ratio between the length of the suture and the length of the wound should be at least 4:1.</description>
