    <textblock>
      Patients implanted with a Bonebridge will be asked to be part of the study. The study
      subjects are enrolled into the study according to inclusion criteria.

      Patients will be asked to wear an adhesive bone conduction device an adapt to it for 30-60
      min. After this time period patients will be asked to use the adhesive device instead of the
      Bonebridge for 3 weeks. Audiologic Tests and quality of life questionnaires will be assessed
      at the beginning of the study and at the end of three weeks.

      Phase 1 Patients will be fitted with an adhesive bone conduction device and asked to fill out
      two questionnaires. They will then wear the device for 30-60 minutes and decide if they want
      to wear the device for the remaining study time of three weeks. Patients who do not have
      sufficient benefit from the device or do not feel comfortable with it do not enter the second
      study period of wearing the device for three weeks. Patients will be asked to comment on
      their experiences after 30 to 60 minutes explaining why they do not want to enter the second
      part of the study if they feel comfortable sharing this information. Phase 2 Patients, in the
      second study period, will be asked to wear the hearing device as long as comfortable to them
      every day and mark time of device usage, battery life, changes of the adhesive adapter, sound
      quality and comfort related remarks in a diary. After three weeks patients will return to the
      outpatient ́s department for an audiological assessment and a second set of quality of
      hearing and quality of life questionnaire.

      No patients will be implanted with a Bonebridge as part of the study.

      Audiologic testing consists of sound field audiometry, Freiburg monosyllables test and
      Oldenburg sentence test.

      Questionnaires consist of the AQol-8D and the SSQ-12

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the average functional hearing gain evaluated by the free field audiometry (at 4 different frequencies) using the bone conduction device compared to the unaided situation. To compare the two hearing devices the following primary endpoint measure will be calculated: Δmean= {(Average functional hearing gain with Bonebridge - Average functional hearing gain with ADHEAR at timepoint T1 (=Δ1)) + (Average functional hearing gain with Bonebridge - Average functional hearing gain with ADHEAR at timepoint T2 (=Δ2))} divided by two. Measuring both hearing devices at both timepoints and using the mean difference (Δmean) enables adjustment for a possible underlying customization effect.</description>
