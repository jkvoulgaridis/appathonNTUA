      The main purpose of this study was to observe the effect of amino acid formula on infants
      with cow's milk protein allergy; to evaluate the role of food avoidance and Open Food
      Challenge test in the diagnosis of infants with cow's milk protein allergy; to observe the
      allergic process in infants with cow's milk protein allergy and to explore the criteria for
      diagnosis and treatment.

      This is a multi-center, prospective cohort study. This study plans to recruit 200 subjects.
      The suitable subject will be enrolled and there are seven visits through the 6-month study.
      Efficacy parameters are the positive incidence of open food challenge test, growth and
      development index (Weight, Height, Head circumference;), and the improvement of CMPA symptoms
      (such as SCORAD, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory, comfort scores).
