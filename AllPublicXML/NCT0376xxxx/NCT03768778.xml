  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective study was done in Neurosurgery trauma unit, Sohag University. Eighteen
      patients reported with different mechanisms of trauma. All patients clinically tested
      involving neurological evaluation. Computed tomography brain was done for them at the time of
      admission. Cautious removal of the penetrating object with local debridement of surrounding
      tissues including skin, skull, dura and brain tissue and watertight closure of the dura
      should be done. Patients transferred to the Intensive care unit (ICU) for 48 - 72 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic intracranial penetration of foreign non-missile object rarely occurs. Early
      mortality may be caused by hemorrhages, major vascular injury or contusions; while epileptic
      seizures and infections are among the possible complications in later stages. Complete
      excision of the foreign object should be done for all patients and any dural and/or vascular
      injuries should be repaired during surgical treatment.

      Neurological level, hemodynamic and respiratory status at hospital admission, type of
      penetrating the object, pupil size, and reactivity, as the CT findings, all these factors
      will affect the prognosis so they should be evaluated carefully before the decision of the
      line of management. Intracranial infection, CSF leak and recurrent attacks of convulsions are
      the most common complications.

      Our goal in this study to report cases with non-missile penetrating head injuries and
      evaluate the possible predictive factors in a series of 18 patients sustaining penetrating
      head injuries, admitted to our hospital over a period of 2 years, to be used as a guide for
      the surgical management.
