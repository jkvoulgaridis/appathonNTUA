  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, quasi-experimental, historically controlled study to evaluate if a
      behavioural change intervention informed by the COM-B model of behaviour change can improve
      nurses' self-perceived capability, opportunity, and motivation to engage in the assessment of
      patients who may be appropriate for IV to PO antimicrobial conversion. This study also seeks
      to determine if this translates into an increase in IV to PO antimicrobial conversion rates
      in the acute care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current antimicrobial stewardship guidelines recommend appropriate and timely IV to PO
      antimicrobial conversion in hospitalized patients. Published rates of IV to PO antimicrobial
      conversion are consistently below 50% in eligible inpatients. Studies have suggested that
      nurses may be well positioned to provide a positive influence on prescriber behavior related
      to antimicrobial IV to PO conversion, however, no published research has evaluated the impact
      of nurses on antimicrobial IV to PO conversion rates. Published research has described the
      barriers and enablers to nurse participation in promoting antimicrobial IV to PO conversion
      using the COM-B model of behaviour change. This quasi-experimental study will evaluate
      whether determinants of nurse behaviour and their actual behaviour can be changed to increase
      antimicrobial IV to PO conversion rates in hospitalized patients.

    <description>Constructs are derived using the Theoretical Domains Framework and assess nurse perceived capability, motivation, and opportunity to promote IV to PO antimicrobial conversion using a 7-point Likert scale (1 - Strongly Disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3- Slightly Disagree, 4 - Neither Agree or Disagree, 5 - Slightly Agree, 6 - Agree, 7- Strongly Agree). The average Likert scale score for each of nine constructs (based on the Theoretical Domains Framework) will be calculated for the pre-intervention period and the post-intervention period. Change in the average Likert score for each construct (question) in the pre-intervention period versus the post-intervention period will be compared for each construct. A higher average Likert score on a construct in the post-intervention period compared to the pre-intervention period indicates improved perceptions about capability, opportunity, or motivation to promote IV to PO antimicrobial conversion.</description>
