  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study to determine if patients between the ages of 18-50
      years, with posture related low back pain, who use the Upright device demonstrate improved
      pain control and self perception of posture compared to those given standard ergonomic
      instruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is a common complaint among students. For many, back pain is directly related to
      poor posture while sitting and standing. Those who spend prolonged time sitting in poor
      posture often develop muscular imbalances leading to tight chest muscles and weakness in back
      muscles. The Upright system is a device which helps provide a sensory reminder to alert users
      when their posture is poor. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients who use the
      upright posture device demonstrate improved pain control and self perception of posture when
      compared to those given standard ergonomic instruction.

    <measure>Score on Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Score on the PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form 6b</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference Short Form utilizes a 7-day recall period (items include the phrase &quot;the past 7 days&quot;). Individuals are to score pain interference for each of the 6 questions from a scale of 1 indicating 'not at all' to 5 indicating 'very much'.</description>

    <description>Patients receiving the Upright device will have a brief training on the use of the device and proper posture. They will be asked to download the Upright app on their phone from the Playstore.
Patients will wear the device once daily for training. They will attach the device applying an adhesive on their upper back, as instructed, and the device will be attached to the adhesive by velcro. Once completed they should remove adhesive.</description>
