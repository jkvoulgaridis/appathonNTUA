  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who will have surgery and need anesthesia, and their parents are often anxious and
      show signs of stress and discomfort. A main reason for concern and anxiety is fear of
      anesthesia and surgery, and lack of knowledge of what is going to happen. The purpose of the
      study is to see if a specific preoperative information brochure aimed at the parents will
      make the parents feel better prepared for the procedures.
