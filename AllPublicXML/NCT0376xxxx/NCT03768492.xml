  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether a caffeine-based cream can reduce the rates
      of reconstructive complications in patients with tissue expander based reconstruction
      requiring post-mastectomy radiation therapy when compared to a placebo cream.

    <description>The US National Cancer Institute developed the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which was formerly called the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), which is a standardized classification of adverse effects in cancer therapy. The current version 5.0 was released in 2017. The criteria uses a grading system of 1 to 5 (e.g. Grade 1 = mild and Grade 5 = death related to AE).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has histologically-confirmed carcinoma of breast (all subtypes are permitted)

          -  Patient has undergone mastectomy with tissue expander-based reconstruction and require
             post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) per the - Stage DCIS (0) -III breast cancer,
             excluding any patients with inflammatory breast cancer at presentation.

          -  Patient will receive irradiation of the chest wall. Additional fields to treat the
             regional nodes including the supraclavicular / axillary and/or internal mammary chains
             is allowed but not required. If a patient requires a boost field to the chest wall,
             scar and/or nodal region this is allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with skin changes or inflammatory carcinoma at presentation Patient has
             (cT4b-d)

          -  unhealed wound in the radiation field

          -  Patient has allergy to Caffeine

          -  Patient has systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma that increases the risk of
             radiation dermatitis development

          -  Patient will receive concurrent chemotherapy with radiation. (Patient is allowed to
             take concurrent hormonal therapy or Trastuzumab)

          -  Planned accelerated or hypofractionated fractionation.

          -  Previous radiation to the ipsilateral breast or chest wall or thoracic region.

          -  Anyone who will require bolus use during radiation (per physician discretion) as this
             will increase rates of acute toxicity interfering with measurement of the primary
             study endpoint.

          -  All pre-menopausal women will require a urine qualitative pregnancy test to exclude
             pregnancy. Pregnant women will be excluded from the study.
