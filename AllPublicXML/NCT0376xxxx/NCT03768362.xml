      Purpose: To determine the surgical outcomes of the plication technique in comparison with the
      resection method on exotropic patients.

      Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, a total of 52 exotropic patients (female, 51.9%)
      who are candidate for medial rectus strengthening will be randomly classified into plication
      (n=24) and resection (n=28) groups. The comprehensive visual and ocular examinations will be
      performed on all study subjects and they will be followed- up for three months
      postoperatively. Plication technique is the same as resection up to muscle suturing, in the
      next step, the sutures are passed through 2 scleral bites at 1 mm anterior to the muscle
      insertion, then the muscle was folded toward inside or outside by pulling and joining the
      sutures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with a residual exotropia and history of uni- or bilateral lateral rectus
        recession or recession and resection (R &amp;R) and those exotropic patients who were going to
        have already recession and resection (R &amp; R) operation due to unilateral constant exotropia
        will be considered as eligible cases to be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with a history of prematurity, intellectual disability, lack of central fixation
        (nystagmus, eccentric fixation, retinopathy of prematurity) subjects with systemic or other
        ocular diseases, neurological disorders, uncooperative patients and participants with less
        than three-month postoperative follow-up will be excluded from this study.
