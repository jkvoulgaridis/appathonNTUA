  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      literature on use of the ultrasound (US) in extubation decisions in cervical spine surgery is
      scarce.The aim of this study will be to evaluate the utility of US as an aid for decision
      making for extubation in elective cervical spine surgery (anterior approach) operations and
      as a predictor for postextubation stridor in these operations

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the correlation between the post procedural laryngeal air-column width difference [LACWD] as obtained by laryngeal US with occurrence of postextubation stridor</measure>
    <time_frame>First 6 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of operation, laryngeal air column width [which is defined as the width of air between the vocal cords as demonstrated by US] will be obtained while the tube cuff is inflated then while it is deflated for three consecutive respiratory cycles after gentle suction of oropharyngeal airway. The laryngeal air-column width difference [LACWD] (the difference between width at balloon-cuff deflation and at balloon-cuff inflation) will be obtained and the average value will be recorded.
Patient will be considered ready for extubation after performance of the cuff-leak test as [the volume of reduced cuff leak test is more than 110 ml] then reversal of neuromuscular blockade will be done. They tube will be removed when the patients can open their eyes on verbal commands and the T4/T1 ratio is 90% or more.
After transferal of patients ICU where they will be observed for occurrence of postextubation stridor in the first 6 hour postoperatively.</description>
