  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urogenital prolapse is a frequent and invalidating pathology in women, involving the anterior
      vaginal wall and the uterus in most cases. Posterior vaginal wall prolapse is present in only
      50% of cases. Surgery is an option for women with troublesome prolapse. A woman's lifetime
      risk of undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery by the age of 80 is around
      19%. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LS) with synthetic non-absorbable mesh is considered the
      gold standard, with a composite success rate of 85% at one year (Prospere study). Based on
      early experience and historical habits, a prerectal mesh was used to be systematically placed
      in the rectovaginal space, in addition to the anterior and apical mesh placed in the
      vesicovaginal space, in order to prevent de-novo posterior prolapse (reported rates up to
      33%).

      The benefit of preventive prerectal mesh is questionned on the basis of a single
      retrospective study comparing 68 LS with double-mesh (anterior &amp; posterior, DM) to 32 LS with
      a single anterior mesh (SAM): posterior recurrence rates were respectively 5.9 vs. 31.3%
      (p&lt;0,01), and total recurrence rates 16.2 vs. 43.8% (p&lt;0.01). However, as this difference was
      not significant in the subgroup of patients without associated cervicocystopexy, the authors
      concluded that the risk of posterior failure was only due to the cervicocystopexy itself
      (anti-urinary incontinence procedure which has been abandoned since).

      On the other hand, a prerectal mesh increases the risk for specific complications: rectal
      injury (up to 3%), anal pain (up to 25%), mesh exposition (up to 2%). Furthermore the
      posterior mesh increases the procedure by a minimum of 30 minutes (Robolaps study,
      unpublished data). The rate of de-novo obstructed defecation after LS with prerectal mesh is
      reported up to 25%. It could be explained by the mesh itself, but also by nerve injuries
      during the dissection of the rectovaginal space and rectal stalks.

    <description>Composite criteria of success at 2 years follow-up: no symptom of vaginal bulge, no prolapse beyond the hymen (&gt;0 cm), no reintervention for prolapse recurrence. Its advantage is that it considers only recurrences that are symptomatic or needing a reintervention. It is strongly linked with women satisfaction after prolapse surgery.</description>
