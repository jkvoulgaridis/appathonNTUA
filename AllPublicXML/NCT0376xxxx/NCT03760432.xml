  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) devices are non-contact instruments that can measure the
      depth of scars, other causes of cloudiness of the cornea, and degree of corneal thinning in
      patients with keratoconus. Laser Custom Corneal Collagen Cross-linking (CXL) significantly
      decreases corneal aberrations and improves vision. This study will use OCT-guided setting for
      the lasers used in the corneal smoothing portion of the laser custom CXL procedure to assess
      the affect on visual outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., CXL and topography-guided laser ablation were approved independently, but not
      together. Another variation in technique involves the use of mitomycin-C (MMC), which is
      effective in reducing corneal haze after the laser surface ablation. Use of MMC during the
      laser custom CXL was associated with better outcomes, but in separate trials that could not
      be directly compared. This study will use OCT measurements to evaluate the magnitudes of
      direct and indirect laser actions after the procedure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity after laser custom CXL</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the CXL procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal of the trial is to determine the extent of visual improvement after laser custom CXL compared to preoperative measurements. Vision will be checked at various time points, but the primary time point will be 6-months post-procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine CXL demarcation line depth</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after the CXL procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The study will use OCT imaging to measure the CXL demarcation line inside the entire optical zone. The demarcation line indicates the portion of corneal stroma being cross-linked. This helps determine to what extent the cornea is being strengthened.</description>

    <description>Preoperative measurements from the OCT are used to assist the calculation in deciding the laser depth settings for smoothing the anterior corneal surface and removing any present opacities. The surgeon uses the OCT data to plan treatment parameters while preserving at least 360 microns of residual corneal stroma using a phototherapeutic keratectomy procedure. After the laser procedure, adjunctive MMC or saline solution will be applied to the cornea in accordance with the group to which the treated eye is randomized. The CXL procedure is then performed following the FDA-approved CXL regimen by Avedro, Inc.</description>
