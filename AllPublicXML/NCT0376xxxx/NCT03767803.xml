      This multicenter non-interventional observational sample acquisition study is designed to
      acquire whole-blood samples from pregnant women who present with signs and symptoms of Pre-E
      and are in the care at an OB-GYN and/or Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) site, defined as
      outpatient centers, clinic sites, and medical offices.

      Study population includes subjects who are pregnant, of any race or ethnicity, 18 to 45 years
      of age, 28 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks' gestational age with a singleton fetus and have provided
      written informed consent to provide whole blood specimens at one or more study visits.
