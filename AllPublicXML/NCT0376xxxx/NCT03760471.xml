  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct the first pilot trial of a collaborative palliative and
      oncology care intervention for HNC patients receiving CRT to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of the intervention. The intervention will incorporate weekly palliative care
      visits into standard oncology care targeting coping, mood, and symptom management.

    <measure>Percentage of patients with coping strategies longitudinally in relation to symptom burden, QOL, mood, and health care utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This exploratory aim will provide preliminary data on associations of coping with patient outcomes to power a larger trial. We will specifically examine whether approach-oriented coping is associated with lower symptom burden, higher QOL and mood, and reduced health care utilization (e.g fewer hospitalizations, fewer treatment breaks or reductions in chemotherapy dose intensity)</description>
