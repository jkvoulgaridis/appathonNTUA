    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) create complications
      during pregnancy, particularly in women with gestational weight gain (GWG) that falls over
      the recommended limit. On the other hand Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) has been shown to
      reduce some complications in women with T2DM and GDM. The aim of this project was to assess
      the association of MNT consultations and eating behavior with GWG in Mexican women with T2DM
      and GDM.

      This cross-sectional study conducted at from 2013 to 2014. Fifty seven patients with T2DM or
      GDM were invited to participate. The dependent variable was GWG and the main independent
      variables were MNT and eating behaviors. Data were obtained from medical records or
      interviews. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess associations.

    <description>Weight (kg) was measured using a weight scale (SECA 711). GWG was calculated by subtracting the prepregnancy weight from the weight at the end of the third trimester (kg). Recommended GWG was based on U.S. Institute of Medicine guidelines.</description>

    <description>MNT was offered every 2-4 weeks to all pregnant women with T2DM and GDM. Women. MNT is offered as a mandatory part of their prenatal visit and/or hospital stay. The MNT provides an individual food plan with the following recommendations: total calories should be calculated as 30 kcal/kg based on pregestational BMI for an ideal weight. Of the total energy intake 40-45% is provided by carbohydrates, a maximum of 40% is provided by lipids and the remaining percentage by proteins providing moderate-to-low glycemic index foods and fiber consumption, glucose self-monitoring, participating in 15-30 min of daily physical activity after prior authorization of the treating physician, and meeting the minimal energy requirements of pregnancy (never &lt; 1,500 kcal).</description>
