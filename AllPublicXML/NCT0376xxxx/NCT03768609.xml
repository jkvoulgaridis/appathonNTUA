  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of cyclosporine on
      the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of pimodivir when coadministered to healthy adult
      participants under fasted conditions.

             protocol

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening and on Day -1 of each
             treatment period

          -  A male participant must wear a condom when engaging in any activity that allows for
             passage of ejaculate to another person (male participants should also be advised of
             the benefit for a female partner to use a highly effective method of contraception as
             condom may break or leak)

          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction
             during the study and for a minimum of 90 days after last study drug intake

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below
             90 milliliter per minute at screening), gastrointestinal disease (such as significant
             diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the investigator's opinion could
             influence drug absorption or bioavailability), thyroid disease, neurologic or
             psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness that the investigator considers
             should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the interpretation of the
             study results

          -  History of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not limited to,
             dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to pimodivir and/or cyclosporine or
             their excipients

          -  History of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to,
             sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy diagnosed in previous studies with
             experimental drugs
