  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold-standard for the evaluation of the colorectal mucosa. Colonoscopy
      quality indicators are the adenoma detection rate, the rate of cecal intubation and the bowel
      preparation.

      The role of diet in preparing for colonoscopy is not fully established. Currently there is
      not enough evidence available to choice between 3 days of low residue diet versus 1 day.

      The research hypothesis is that the low residue diet offers a non-inferior bowel preparation
      and an improved tolerance.
