  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of patients who have ingested a caustic product has changed since 2007.
      Whereas previously the lesion assessment and surgical indication were based on endoscopic
      data, the therapeutic algorithm is currently based solely on the results of a CT scan with
      contrast injection, performed 6 hours after ingestion. This examination makes it possible to
      reliably assess the viability of the esophageal and gastric walls and thus to indicate
      digestive resection. The therapeutic consequences of this new treatment are important
      because, by expanding the indications for conservative treatment after severe ingestion, it
      brings a significant gain in terms of survival, morbidity and functional outcome. In the
      absence of emergency digestive resection, however, the functional prognosis is often
      overshadowed by the formation of esophageal stenosis in the months following ingestion.
      Patients then require endoscopic dilation treatment. In the event of failure or impossibility
      of dilation, which defines refractory stenosis, esophageal reconstruction is necessary. In
      case of sequential pharyngeal stenosis following ingestion, esophageal and pharyngeal
      reconstruction is indicated as a first-line treatment, since these stenosis do not respond to
      endoscopic dilations. The expansion of the indications for conservative treatment after
      severe ingestion using CT scans has led to an increase in the incidence of after-effect
      stenosis.

      We aim to develop a therapeutic approach that will prevent the development of refractory and
      pharyngeal esophageal stenosis. Indeed, there is currently no strategy that has proven
      effective in this regard in adults. The value of corticosteroid therapy for the prevention of
      caustic stenosis has only been evaluated in children and remains controversial.

      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of early systemic corticosteroid therapy on the
      risk of refractory esophageal or pharyngeal stenosis within one year of ingestion of a
      caustic substance in a population of patients at high risk of stenosis, defined according to
      tomodensitometric criteria (grade IIb: severe lesions, absence of transparietal necrosis),
      and for whom there is no indication of urgent digestive resection.

    <description>The primary outcome is the indication for esophageal or pharyngeal surgical reconstruction due to:
The occurrence of one or more esophageal stenosis refractory to endoscopic dilation within 12 months of ingestion, as defined by:
The need for more than 5 sessions of esophageal endoscopic dilation
Non-expandable stenosis or esophageal obstruction;
An esophageal perforation that occurs during dilation, which contraindicates the continuation of dilation.
The occurrence of pharyngeal stenosis, defined by the need to perform pharyngoplasty.</description>
