  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a hemodynamic and physiopathological condition that is defined
      as an increase in pulmonary artery pressure â‰¥25 mmHg when measured at resting with symptoms
      such as dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope. PH characterized by decreased exercise
      capacity, quality of life, peripheral muscle strength, balance, and physical inactivity. It
      is recommended that patients with PH should be included in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
      programs in addition to medical treatment. Ground-based walking training is a safe and
      effective method for COPD patients. In the literature, there are no studies evaluating the
      effects of ground-based walking training in PH patients.

      The aim of this project is to determine the effect of ground-based walking training on
      physical activity, exercise capacity, balance, peripheral muscle strength and quality of life
      in patients with PH.

    <description>Patients will attend a 2-day 30-minute ground-based walking training under the supervision of a physiotherapist. Patients will walk for 1-2 days in a week without supervision. According to the Modified Borg Scale, the dyspnea intensity will be 3-4 (medium to slightly difficult) and the heart rate will be completed to not exceed 120 min / pulse. Heart rate of patients will be followed by finger type pulse oximeter</description>
