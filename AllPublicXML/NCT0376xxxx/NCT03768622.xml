  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal femoral fractures are a typical pathology in elderly patients after a low-energy
      trauma.

      This study analyses preexisting risk factors for proximal femoral fractures as well as for
      failing to reach the previous functional level, difference in outcome between patients with
      femoral neck fracture compared to those with pertrochanteric fracture, surgical performance
      and its significance for the functional outcome, as well as the impact of proximal femoral
      fractures on patients' one-year independence.
