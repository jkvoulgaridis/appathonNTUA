  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind study of the safety and performance of fractional
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and reduction of acne scarring. The study will evaluate
      50 treatment sites in subjects requesting treatment of their acne scarring. The study will
      involve three treatments on both sides of the face with 3-5 week intervals between each
      treatment. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after their last treatment. Analysis
      will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment.

    <description>The Venus Viva™ fractional RF applicator has been shown in clinical studies to improve various skin conditions related to aging and alter collagen structures such as wrinkles, rhytids and scars.
Beginning with the Baseline visit (Visit 1), subjects will receive a total of 3 treatments approximately 3-5 weeks apart. The left and right side of the face will be treated and assessed as independent sites, and the same applicator tip configuration will be used to treat both sides at all 3 treatment visits.</description>
