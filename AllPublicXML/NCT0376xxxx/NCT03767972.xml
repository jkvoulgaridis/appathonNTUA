  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-ablative and ablative devices are the most commonly used minimally-invasive treatments
      for skin rejuvenation. Current devices on the market for rejuvenation include the lasers such
      as the Fraxel Restore, the Halo, the Helios III, the Pico, the ThermiVa and the DiVa which
      have all been shown to have efficacy for the rejuvenation of the face, décolletage, hands and
      vagina. In this study we propose to compare the efficacy and side effect profile of these
      devices for skin rejuvenation of various areas of the body including the face, décolletage,
      hands, trunk, upper and lower extremities, and vagina.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective clinical trial to compare various energy-based devices for the rejuvenation of the face, neck/décolletage, hands, upper and lower extremities and vagina. Adults seeking rejuvenation of either the face, neck/décolletage, hands, upper and lower extremities, trunk and/or vagina will be treated with appropriate energy-based device(s) based on investigators' discretion. If patients' require rejuvenation of multiple areas, per investigator assessment, they will be allowed to get treatment in multiple areas. Patients will be followed for 3 months post-treatment to determine if the procedure was efficacious for rejuvenation of the area(s) treated.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Adults requiring rejuvenation of either the face, neck/décolletage, hands, upper and lower extremities, trunk and/or vagina will receive energy-based treatment (Fraxel Restore, Helios III, PicoWay, Halo, ThermiVa or DiVa) based on the investigators' assessment and discretion. The treating physician will decide which energy-based device is best-suited to addressing the patients' aging concerns; although patient preference will be taken into account, ultimately the treating physician will be responsible for the correct assessment of patients' rejuvenation needs and use of appropriate energy-based devices for the final treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Exhibit skin aging and will benefit from skin rejuvenation treatment of the face,
             neck/décolletage, trunk, hands, upper and lower extremities and/or vagina as
             determined by the investigator/physician.

          2. Subjects between the ages of 18-85 years old, at the time of consent.

          3. Subjects may be male or female.

          4. Subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin type I-III (Fraxel Restore, Helios III, Pico) or I-VI
             (Halo, ThermiVa, DiVa).

          5. Subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with
             the requirements of this protocol. The consent form has been standardized in English.
             For those patients who do not read and understand English, a consent form will be
             standardized and provided in a language that they read and understand if possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children and adolescents (less than 18 years old).

          2. Subjects who are not willing or able to provide written consent.

          3. Individuals with any significant medical history including skin disorders and eating
             disorders as determined by the investigator/physician.

          4. Subjects on any substances affecting blood coagulation (including but not limited to
             aspirin and other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, vitamin E, fish oil,
             heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, novel anti-coagulants).

          5. Subjects with known blood coagulopathies.

          6. Subjects with a compromise of local blood supply (including but not limited to recent
             surgery, severe scarring, autoimmune diseases involving the face, neck/décolletage,
             trunk, hands or lower extremities such as lupus, morphea, sarcoid or mixed connective
             tissue disease) (dependent on their treatment group).

          7. Subjects who have received energy-based rejuvenation treatment of the face,
             neck/décolletage, trunk, hands, upper and lower extremities, and/or vagina within the
             past 3 months (dependent on the area they are planning to treat).

          8. Subjects who meet any of the contraindication criteria listed in the product
             information for the device the subject will be treated with.
