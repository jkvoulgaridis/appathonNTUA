  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the speed of bone healing of the two most commonly
      used xenografts on the market, Bio-Oss® and Salvin-Oss® using a tooth extraction ridge
      preservation model in participants scheduled for tooth extraction and subsequent receipt of a
      dental implant. Researchers hypothesize that there will be additional vital bone at 16-20
      weeks with Salvin-Oss®.

      This study focuses on xenografts to preserve alveolar bone after tooth extraction prior to
      placement of a dental implant. Extraction sites that are not grafted for ridge preservation
      may lose up to 50 percent of their ridge width the first year after extraction. Xenografts
      are one of several products on the market used to maintain ridge width after tooth
      extraction. This study aims to compare the two most commonly used, FDA-approved xenografts on
      the market, Bio-Oss® and Salvin-Oss, in the preservation of alveolar bone after extraction of
      non-molar teeth.

      The primary objective of this study is to histologically evaluate and compare the percentage
      of new bone formation in healing extraction sockets of non-molar teeth grafted with Bio-Oss®
      versus Salvin-Oss®. The secondary aim is to observe clinical changes in ridge height and
      ridge width after grafting with these two materials.
