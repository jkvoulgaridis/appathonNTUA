  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate if the extended release formulation of WD-1603 generates
      anticipated plasma concentration profile. The study is an open-label, sequential, 3-way
      crossover study to evaluate if WD-1603 generates anticipated plasma levodopa exposure
      compared to Sinemet IR tablets in healthy subjects. The study comprises of a medical
      Screening visit, three 2-night (3-day) Treatment periods, 2 outpatient visits, and a
      Follow-up visit. Study drug administration in each Treatment period is separated by a washout
      interval of 5 days. The Follow-up visit will occur approximately 7 days (±1) following the
      last study drug administration. The duration of subject participation, including screening,
      is approximately 6 weeks.
