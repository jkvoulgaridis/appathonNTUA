      Phase 1 open-label study to estimate the safety, manufacturing feasibility, and efficacy of
      intravenously administered, lentivirally transduced T cells expressing anti-CD123 chimeric
      antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) costimulatory domains in
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of CART123 cells
      following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Subjects
      will be treated with a split dosing approach of CART123 cells (10% Day 0; 30% Day 1; 60% Day
      2) for Cohort 1a/1b or a single IV administration of CART123 cells for Cohort 2.

      The total dose administered to each subject will be based on body weight obtained at the time
      of apheresis. Thus, the target total transduced dose, preceded by lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy, is 1-2x10^6 CART123 cells/kg for Cohort 1a, 5x10^6 CART123 cells/kg for Cohort
      1b, or 2x10^6 CART-123 cells/kg for Cohort 2. The protocol-specified minimum acceptable dose
      for infusion is 1x10^5 CART123 cells/kg for all cohorts.

      It is recommended per routine clinical care, that all subjects with marrow aplasia at Day
      28+/-5 undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) as a rescue strategy.
      If required, this procedure will be performed as part of routine care, outside of the scope
      of this research study, however subjects will continue to be followed on study. All subjects
      should therefore have a previously identified stem cell donor in order to participate in this
      study. Please see Section 6.8 for additional details.

      All subjects will be followed monthly for up to 6 months post the first CART123 cell infusion
      (Day 0). Thereafter subjects will be transitioned into LTFU for up to 15 years post infusion.

                  phenotypic or cytogenetic abnormalities (measurable residual disease, MRD) at any
                  time after allogeneic HCT is eligible

          3. Subjects with relapsed disease after prior transplant must meet one of the following:

             a. Subjects with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic HCT (myeloablative or
             non-myeloablative) will be eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria and i.
             Have no residual donor cells (by STR analysis on 2 occasions separated by at least 1
             month), OR: ii. Donor cells are present but there is no active GVHD (&gt;Gr II), subject
             does not require systemic immunosuppression and is more than 3 months from transplant,
             and at least 1 month off GVHD prophylaxis.

             b. Subjects with relapsed disease after prior autologous or syngeneic HCT will be
             eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria and it has been more than 3 months
             from transplant.

          4. Subjects must have a suitable stem cell donor available who may donate cells in the
             event the subject needs to undergo an allogeneic HCT. Donor may be matched or
             mismatched and must be found to be suitable according to the institution's standard
             criteria; donors must be fully cleared to proceed as the donor.

          5. Satisfactory organ functions:

               1. Creatinine ≤ 1.6 mg/dl

               2. ALT/AST must be ≤5 x upper limit of normal unless related to disease

               3. Direct bilirubin or total bilirubin &lt; 2.0mg/dl, unless subject has Gilbert's
                  syndrome (≤3.0 mg/dL);

             (as described in protocol Section 4.3).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating (nursing women) women.

          2. Patients with relapsed AML with t(15:17).

          3. HIV infection.

          4. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressant medications. Recent or
             current use of inhaled steroids or physiologic replacement with hydrocortisone is not
             exclusionary. For additional details regarding use of steroids while on study, please
             see Section 5.5.

          6. Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as
             outlined.

         11. Subjects with clinically apparent arrhythmia, or arrhythmias that are not stable on
             medical management, within 2 weeks of the Screening/Enrollment visit.
