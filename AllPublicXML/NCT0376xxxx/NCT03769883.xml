  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will provide an exercise-based lifestyle intervention with the potential to
      reduce complications for patients with short standing type 2 diabetes (T2D). While exercise
      is widely accepted as a component of T2D management, little is known about the additive
      effect of exercise when combined with a diet on T2D pathophysiology and mechanisms believed
      to lead to micro- and macrovascular complications. Moreover, the necessary dose of exercise
      to revert the progression of T2D and the related complications has not been investigated. A
      large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be essential to document the effectiveness
      on reducing the risk of T2D complications. However, prior to conducting a large-scale RCT, we
      need to specify the exercise dose that efficiently compliments the diet.

      In a 4-armed randomized, clinical trial (N=80 T2D patients, T2D duration &lt; than 7 years) we
      aim to investigate 1) the potential additive role of exercise on pancreatic β-cell function
      in patients with T2D when combined with a diet, 2) the causal relationship between
      lifestyle-induced reductions in glycaemic variability, oxidative stress and low-grade
      inflammation and, 3) the role of exercise in rescuing dysregulated muscle progenitor cells.
      The participants will be randomly allocated to either a) control, b) diet, c) diet and
      exercise 3 times/week or d) diet and exercise 6 times/week for 16 weeks. Prior to, during and
      following the interventions, all participants will undergo extensive testing.

      A 4-armed, 16-week, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized, clinical trial.
      Participants will be randomly allocated (1:1:1:1), stratified by sex

      Interventions:

      The lifestyle interventions will consist of two main components; 1) increased physical
      activity and structured exercise and/or 2) a dietary intervention aiming at a weight loss.
      Whereas there will be no differences in the dietary intervention between the lifestyle
      groups, the volume of physical activity and structured exercise will vary according to the
      frequencies of the structured exercise sessions.

      The study groups are prescribed:

        1. Control group (CON): No intervention

        2. Dietary control (DCON): Dietary intervention (see below)

        3. Moderate Exercise Dose (MED): Two aerobic training sessions per week of 45-60 min
           duration and one session per week with combined aerobic (30-35 min) and resistance (30
           min) training and a dietary intervention (described below)

        4. High Exercise Dose (HED): Four aerobic training sessions per week of 45-60 min duration
           and two sessions per week with combined aerobic (30-35 min) and resistance (30 min)
           training and a dietary intervention (described below)

      Detailed description of the intervention components. Exercise: The training protocol will be
      adapted based on a previous study where the T2D participants were prescribed 6 weekly
      sessions of aerobic training alone or combined aerobic and resistance training (averaging
      360-420 min of exercise per week). As previous analyses suggest that there may be an inverse
      dose-response relationship between reductions in HbA1c and aerobic exercise volume, this
      parameter will be used to adapt the training protocol. As the effect of exercise on HbA1c is
      closer related to the number of training sessions rather than intensity15, we will reduce the
      number of sessions by 50%, to three sessions/week in the moderate exercise dose group and
      maintain the original session frequency in the high dose exercise group (six
      sessions/week).Training will be supervised and monitored to ensure intensity and compliance.

      Dietary intervention and intended weight loss (DCON, MED and HED: The dietary intervention
      will be based on the recommendations from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) with
      increased focus on macronutrient quality. The macronutrient distributions are in line with
      the current guidelines from the national Diabetes Association and Canadian guidelines, where
      individualization in macronutrient distribution should lie within the range of 45-60 energy%
      carbohydrate, 15-20 energy% protein and 20-35 energy% fat. Thus, the dietary intervention
      emphasis will be on low glycemic index and low glycemic load in shape of non-processed foods
      and will aim at reducing saturated fat intake &lt;7 energy%.

    <masking_description>Upon completion of the study and prior to breaking the allocation code, a data-collection form is generated by a statistician and the principal investigator. The data-analyst breaks the allocation code and labels the participants according to the assigned treatment and analyzes the outcomes. Following the analyses, group allocation will be concealed in all data outputs and the N per group and present the data to the writing committee in a blinded fashion. Then the writing committee will provide their blinded interpretations.</masking_description>
