  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the investigational software for magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) systems and techniques to process magnetic resonance (MR) images
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop new technologies for MRI systems. The new technologies
      should improve MRI capabilities in terms of how sensitive, specific, and efficient they are.
      The overall goal is to get better measurements of the brain tumor tissue(s).

      In this research study, the investigators want to learn more about investigational software
      and about techniques to process MR images. The testing of investigational software will allow
      the investigators to improve the image quality. As part of the testing process, the
      investigators will collect more MR images of the brain, and improve current image
      reconstruction methods. This will allow a more precise analysis of MR images and potentially
      better assessment of the brain tumor tissue volume.

    <description>The outcome measure for this project will be that the rapid scan from Wave-CAIPI can provide equivalent diagnostic quality to that of standard clinical acquisitions which is performed at much slower speed. This will be assess using visual qualitative assessment by experienced radiologists on the project.</description>
