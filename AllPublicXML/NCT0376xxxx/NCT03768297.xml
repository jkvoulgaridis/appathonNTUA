      Immediate implant placement in the esthetic zone is very challenging procedure although it is
      documented as a promising procedure (Berglundh, Persson and Klinge, 2002)(Cosyn et al.,
      2011). Extraction is usually accompanied by remodeling of the hard tissues which is more
      crucial in the anterior maxilla as it affects soft tissue esthetics(Araujo and Lindhe,
      2005)(Covani et al., 2004)(Juodzbalys and Wang, 2007). It is well established that implant
      placement without filling the buccal gap leads to noticeable amount of bone loss at the
      alveolar contour(Botticelli, Berglundh and Lindhe, 2004)(Sanz et al., 2010). The protocol of
      immediate implant and temporization serves to provide acceptable esthetic results but soft
      tissue stability around the implant restoration is not always satisfactory(Noelken et al.,
      2018).Amount of soft tissue recession can be specified following immediate implant placement,
      even with flapless technique there is a limited risk of midfacial recession(Cosyn, Hooghe and
      De Bruyn, 2012).It was found that inadequate bone grafting in the facial defect increases the
      chance of mid facial recession(Le, Borzabadi-Farahani and Pluemsakunthai, 2014).

      By definition, the dual zone can be divided into soft tissue zone and bone zone; the soft
      tissue zone is the vertical dimension change measured from the free gingival margin to the
      mid crest labially, the bone zone is the hard tissues measured from the crestal bone towards
      the apex(Chu et al., 2012). The concept of the dual zone aims to maintain the hard, soft
      tissue volume and the blood clot where the grafting material act as a scaffold containing
      them and this will enhance the initial healing compared to the classic protocol of bone
      filling till the buccal bone level(Chu et al., 2012). A recent study claims that the
      xenograft particles can be successfully incorporated within the soft tissue without
      inflammation enhancing the soft tissue profile(Araujo and Lindhe, 2005). The temporary
      restoration has shown socket sealing property which protect and contain the blood clot and
      the graft material enhancing healing,thus filling the gap without involvement of the soft
      tissue has been the rational for immediate implant placement(Trimpou G, Weigl P, Krebs M,
      2010).The main benefit of the dual zone concept is maintaining the blood supply from the
      periosteum and endosteum producing maximum healing potential with preserving the soft tissue
      stability by filling the soft tissue zone with bone graft in addition to immediate
      temporization acting as socket seal(Chu et al., 2012).

    <description>The PES is based on seven variables: mesial papilla, distal papilla, soft-tissue level, softtissuecontour, alveolar process deficiency,soft-tissue color and texture. Each variable shall be assessed with a 2-1-0 score,with 2 being the best and 0 being thepoorest score.The mesial and distal papilla will be evaluatedfor completeness, incompleteness orabsence. All other variables will be assessedby comparison to a reference tooth.(Fürhauser et al., 2005)</description>
