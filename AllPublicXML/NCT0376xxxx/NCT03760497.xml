  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molar-Incisive Hipomineralization (MIH) is defined as a qualitative change in tooth enamel of
      systemic origin, which affects one or more permanent first molars, and may or may not involve
      permanent incisors. MIH has several clinical repercussions, such as presence of
      hypersensitivity, difficulty in local anesthesia, reduction of restorations longevity, among
      others, making it difficult to perform dental treatment. Therefore, the present study will
      evaluate, through a randomized controlled clinical study, three restorative protocols for the
      treatment of severe MIH (with post eruptive enamel fracture and dentin exposure). The
      following groups will be evaluated: direct restoration with composite resin; restoration with
      composite resin with diode laser application and temporary restoration with glass ionomer
      cement followed by restoration with composite resin). The restorations will be evaluated
      after 1 week, 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The main outcome will be evaluation of restoration
      longevity, presence of caries lesion and wear of the restoration surface. Other outcomes such
      as patient satisfaction with treatment, patient discomfort, anxiety, assessment of dentin
      sensitivity and impact on participants' quality of life, as well as the duration and cost of
      treatment, as well as their cost-effectiveness ratio will also be evaluated . Multilevel
      statistical analyzes will be performed to verify the effectiveness of diode laser treatment
      compared to sealing, in addition to possible factors associated with this efficacy.
