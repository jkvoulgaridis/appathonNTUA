    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The investigators hypothesize
      that participants receiving app-CBT will have greater improvement in QIDS-C scores than those
      in the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 8).

    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to test the efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment
      for adults with MDD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects (N=112) will be randomly assigned
      to 8 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD either immediately, or after a 8-week long
      waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT
      for MDD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with MDD, and that it will lead to
      greater reductions in MDD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist
      control).

    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician version (QIDS-C) is a clinician-administered interview that assesses depressive symptom severity in the past seven days. It contains 16 items ranging from 0-3, which are summed to generate a total score of depressive symptom severity (range=0-27).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on functional impairment (SDS). The SDS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on quality of life, assessed using The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>

    <description>8-week Smartphone-delivered CBT for MDD. In-person cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for MDD. The app-delivered CBT in this project includes modules such as cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, core belief work), behavioral activation, and perceptual retraining/mindfulness skills.</description>
