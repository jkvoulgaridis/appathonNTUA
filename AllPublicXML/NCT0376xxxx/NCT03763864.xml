  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to build a collection of biological samples consisting of
      fibroblasts and primary keratinocytes from patients with orphan monogenic diseases and to use
      these cells in the customization of functional tests. The miniaturized tests we are setting
      up make it possible to distinguish patient cells from control cells. They can be used to test
      molecules or for the development of diagnostic tests.

      As part of the research protocol, the investigating physicians will be able to perform a skin
      biopsy on their patient included in the study. APTEEUS will isolate fibroblasts and
      keratinocytes and ensure their preservation. As part of the project, it is planned to
      preserve the biological samples collected and to preserve the collection after the end of the
      study. Skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes that are isolated from the biopsy are cells that
      can be preserved and amplified. They are a material of choice for the functional study of
      many monogenic diseases.

      This study will allow the adaptation of tools dedicated to the functional study of monogenic
      diseases in order to help in the research and development of new treatments for these
      diseases, but also to highlight and explain the inter-individual variability of symptoms and
      responses to treatments, and finally, to help in the development of diagnostic methods.

      Patients with orphan monogenic diseases whose genetic defect has been confirmed and for whom
      the study of the disease can be performed on fibroblasts, keratinocytes or cells derived from
      them, may be included in the study. Subjects, after information and consent, will undergo a
      skin biopsy. The sample will be sent directly to the promoter company APTEEUS, which will
      carry out all in vitro developments. The fibroblasts and keratinocytes will be preserved and
      will constitute a collection of cells &quot;orphan monogenic diseases&quot;. The samples can be reused
      for new research in the same field.
