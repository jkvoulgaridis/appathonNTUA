  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this Phase 2 double blind, placebo controlled crossover clinical study is
      to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of CXA-10 in obese adult asthmatics. Obesity induces a
      chronic systemic inflammatory state characterized by impaired adipokine signaling,
      pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, inflammatory cell activation and enhanced generation of
      oxidative inflammatory mediators. This impacts the lung, increasing the severity of asthma
      and its exacerbations. This research will evaluate how a synthetic nitro-fatty acid (CXA-10,
      10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid) suppresses the systemic and airway inflammation that
      contributes to the obese asthmatic phenotype. Current data support the pleiotropic signaling
      actions of CXA-10 to induce adaptive signaling actions that beneficially modulate adipokine
      and cytokine expression and inhibit systemic and pulmonary inflammation. The investigators
      hypothesize that CXA-10 induced signaling responses will alleviate obesity-related airway
      hyperreactivity in obese adult asthmatics.

             or surgically sterile, or, if child-bearing potential (WOCP) should agree to use an
             acceptable method of contraception, for the duration of the study, with a negative
             pregnancy test prior to entering the study.

          2. BMI &gt;/= 30

          3. Diagnosis of asthma: based on previous physician diagnosis for &gt; 6 months, and
             baseline pre-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 between 50 and 95% predicted with either a 12%
             or greater bronchodilator response to 4 puffs of albuterol or PC20 methacholine (16
             mg) if &lt;12% change post BD

          4. Regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (up to 1000 mcg/day

             muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), which can be combination medication for at least 3
             months; on a stable dose for the 4 weeks prior to Visit 0

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Respiratory tract infection within the last 4 weeks

          2. Oral or systemic corticosteroid burst within the last 4 weeks

          3. Asthma-related hospitalization within the last 6 weeks

          4. Three or more asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids
             in the past year consistent with severe asthma

          5. Asthma-related ER visit within the previous 4 weeks

          6. Current smoking or have former smokers that quit within the previous 1 year, or 10
