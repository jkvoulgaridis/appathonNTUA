      -  Background: The majority of the burden of HPV-related cervical cancer is in developing
           countries while most of the effectiveness reports of HPV vaccination are currently
           coming from developed countries. Also, currently many adult women are left without
           either HPV vaccination or cervical cancer screening. Effectiveness data of currently
           available HPV vaccines among adult women in developing countries are needed for women
           and healthcare workers and policy makers to best protect women from cervical cancer.

        -  Primary Study Objective:

           - To determine the effectiveness bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines in reduction of
           cervical dysplasia (Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion or worse; LSIL+)
           attributable to HPV types 16 or 18 after at least 5 years of vaccination among Thai
           women vaccinated at their ages 20-45 years with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine

        -  Secondary Study Objectives:

             -  To measure the effectiveness of currently available bivalent and quadrivalent HPV
                vaccines in reducing the prevalence of HPV 16 or 18

             -  To measure the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in reducing any abnormal Pap smear
                result (ASC-US+)

             -  To compare the effectiveness of HPV vaccines according to the number of doses
                immunized

             -  To find out risk factor(s) for HPV 16 or 18-related cervical dysplasia in this
                cohort

             -  To assess the prevalence of other high-risk HPV types in vaccinated and
                non-vaccinated group

             -  To determine direct and/or indirect cost of HPV vaccination

        -  The hypothesis to be tested: At least one dose of vaccination with bi- or quadri-valent
           HPV vaccine will reduce the prevalence of LSIL+ attributable to HPV 16/18 by 80% after
           at least 5 years of vaccination.

        -  Materials and Methods: This study will be a retrospective matched cohort study. Data is
           to be collected either by from samples for Pap and HPV test and/or HPV 16/18 genotyping
           of the recruited participants, or from existing medical records. HPV vaccinated women at
           their ages 20-45 years (vaccinated group) and women received Pap smear at their ages
           20-45 years without vaccination (control group) will be included in the study. Pap smear
           and HPV test and/or HPV 16/18 typing result of 2 groups will be compared after ≥ 5 years
           of vaccination or baseline Pap smear. Those who don't have Pap smear results ≥ 5 years
           after vaccination or ≥ 5 years after the baseline Pap smear will be offered for a Pap
           smear and HPV 16/18 typing
