  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the need for consistent adherence to medical care, youth living with HIV have low
      rates of adherence to medications and treatment. There are few interventions to improve
      adherence to HIV medications and treatment for youth, and there is a great need for novel
      approaches that are engaging for this age group. The investigators developed an intervention
      that includes a mobile gaming app that is integrated with a 7-day electronic medication
      device and text messages. During gameplay, youth fight HIV in colorful organ systems. A small
      previous project found that the intervention helped youth who were newly starting medications
      for HIV by improving adherence and decreasing HIV virus in their bodies (viral load). This
      proposed project will test the intervention with larger number of youth (100) who are newly
      starting HIV treatment and medications in New England and in Mississippi. The investigators
      want to determine if adherence is improved and viral load is reduced in this larger sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite need for consistent adherence to medical care, youth living with HIV (YLWH) have low
      rates of adherence and retention in care, and are at great risk for being lost to
      follow-up.(5,16-18) There is a great need for adherence interventions that are novel and
      appealing for YLWH.(7,8,14) The investigators developed, and preliminarily examined, a
      multi-level technology that integrates a 7-day smart medication device WITH an immersive and
      appealing smartphone app/game that is attractive and engaging for YLWH.(82,83) During
      gameplay, YLWH fight HIV in colorful and immersive organ systems, and receive adherence
      related text messages with game graphics. Electronic medication monitoring device openings
      guide game-related text messages. The investigators tested the Multilevel Gaming Intervention
      in a developmental trial. The impact of the intervention was greatest among those who had
      newly begun ART. In participants who had newly begun ART, the intervention decreased viral
      load and improved ART adherence. Those newly starting ART in the intervention, compared to
      those newly starting ART in the control, experienced a 0.96 log viral load greater decrease
      and evidenced a large effect size for improved adherence as measured by an electronic
      medication monitoring device (d=1.18, 71% vs. 48% adherence at post-test). These interactions
      between intervention and newly starting ART were significant in ANCOVAs, accounting for
      baseline values (viral load: F=4.33, p=0.04, adherence: F=3.20, p=0.05). For this next
      proposed stage of research, the investigators will further test the Multilevel Gaming
      Intervention with YLWH who are newly starting ART at clinical sites in New England and in
      Mississippi. A multisite randomized controlled study (48 weeks) among 100 YLWH newly starting
      ART will test the efficacy of the intervention compared to a control condition (who receive a
      non-HIV game and the electronic medication monitoring device) on behavioral and biological
      measures.

    <description>Balfour L, Kowal J, Tasca GA, et al. Development and psychometric validation of the HIV Treatment Knowledge Scale. AIDS Care. 2007;19(9):1141-1148.
The HIV Treatment Knowledge scale is a 21-item scale that assesses knowledge about complex HIV treatment issues such as co-occurring illnesses and drug resistance. Response options include &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, and &quot;Do not know&quot;. Cronbach's alpha was 0.90 in a population of HIV-infected adults. Higher scores indicate greater HIV treatment knowledge.

Six Likert-style items assess social support for taking medications, going to medical appointments, and other tasks related to adherence. Responses options range from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly agree&quot;. Cronbach's alpha for this scale is 0.91. Higher scores indicate greater perceived social support.
