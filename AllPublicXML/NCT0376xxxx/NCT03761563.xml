      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized post-market evaluation designed to
      collect and evaluate data on the safety and performance of the Fortilink IBF System with
      TETRAfuse 3D Technology.

      There will be 3 arms in the study, one for each configuration of the Fortilink IBF system
      (Fortilink-C, Fortilink-TS and Fortilink-L). Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled in each study
      arm for a total of up to 150 subjects at up to 20 sites in the United States (US) and
      European Union (EU).
