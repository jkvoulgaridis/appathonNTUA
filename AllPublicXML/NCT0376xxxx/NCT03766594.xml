  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent unexplained spontaneous miscarriage (RSM) is defined as three consecutive pregnancy
      loss prior to 20 weeks from the last menstrual period. 1% to 2% of women experience RSM.
      Treatment of URSM is a challenging issue. The currently available lines of treatment
      according to simplicity of use, reliability and degree of invasiveness include
      corticosteroids, sildenafil citrate, aspirin, heparin and immunoglobulins (besides good
      antenatal care), but up to now there are no prospective randomized studies, powerful enough,
      to determine a significant difference between these therapeutic protocols, with any of the
      above mentioned pharmacological agents.

      Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra®), a vasodilator, is also described as an anti-inflammatory agent.
      While improving uterine blood flow in the proliferative phase, NO may have detrimental
      effects at the level of the endometrium during the implantation window. The NO- mediated
      release of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor- from activated natural killer cells has
      been implicated as a cause of implantation failure.

      Based on these observations, this study attempts was made to study uterine arteries and
      sub-endometrial blood flow during the luteal phase in normal fertile women and in patients
      with Unexplained recurrent miscarriage
