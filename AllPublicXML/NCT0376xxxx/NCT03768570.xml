      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects durvalumab has on bladder cancer,
      combined with treatment after completion of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at whether a type of immunotherapy drug called durvalumab can be safely
      administered after initial treatment received by a patient. Durvalumab has been tested in
      many different types of cancers. Durvalumab works by allowing the immune system to detect
      cancer and reactivate the immune response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or
      may cause cancer cells to die. It is unclear if the addition of durvalumab is beneficial in
      patients with bladder cancer who have completed surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

             an alternative to cisplatin during radiotherapy.

          -  The following are radiotherapy guidelines for patients treated on study. Patients will
             be treated to radical treatment doses using IMRT, VMAT or 4 field conformal

                  40 Gy in 20f]

          -  Patients receiving concurrent bladder boost: pelvis dose 40 Gy and bladder dose 50 Gy
             given in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. Adaptive radiotherapy techniques would be

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there

             trial.
