  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a bronchial radiofrequency ablation system (SyMap
      Medical (Suzhou) Ltd) in a population of subjects with severe asthma who are still
      symptomatic despite being managed on high-dose Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) and Long-Acting
      β2-adrenergic Agonists (LABA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, clinical study comparing the SyMap
      bronchial radiofrequency ablation system to the Boston Scientific Bronchial Thermoplasty
      System (Alair System). The study population consisted of subjects with severe asthma who are
      still symptomatic despite being managed on high dose ICS and LABA. Patients with severe
      asthma who still have symptoms, despite the standard drug maintenance recommended by the
      guidelines, after signing the informed consent, who meet the inclusion exclusion criteria
      enter the baseline period and continued to use uniform ICS and LABA, which will last at least
      4 weeks. Patients with at least two days asthma symptoms during the baseline period, and meet
      the eligibility criteria are assigned to the experimental or control group at a 1:1 ratio
      based on a central randomized system. A total of 160 subjects will be enrolled, 80 in the
      experimental group and 80 in the control group. The experimental group is treated with SyMap
      radiofrequency ablation system, and the control group is treated with the same procedure
      using Boston Scientific Bronchial Thermoplasty Aliar System. For subjects in the experimental
      group and the control group, follow-up by telephone call will be performed at 1, 2, 7 days
      after each procedure and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 months after the third procedure,
      and outpatient follow-up will be performed at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after the third
      procedure. ICS and LABA are administered within one year after the third procedure. The
      difference in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations per year (the number of severe asthma
      exacerbations per person per year), at 12 months after bronchial radiofrequency ablation, is
      the primary endpoint of the study, and the success rate of procedure, postoperative adverse
      events, and serious adverse events are safety endpoints.

    <description>Definition of severe asthma exacerbations:
Patients who do not receive oral corticosteroids maintenance, systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspensions or injections) need to be used, or ICS doses doubled, due to increased asthma symptoms.
Patients who have been treated with oral corticosteroids maintenance daily or every other day, the daily dose of systemic corticosteroids needs to be increased, due to increased asthma symptoms;
Note: Severe asthma exacerbations of the above described two conditions, after treatment with corticosteroids, stabilized for 1 week or more, then recurring asthma symptoms will be counted as a single severe asthma exacerbations.</description>

    <description>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire consists of 32 items covering asthma-related symptoms and limitations during the 2 weeks preceding administration of the questionnaire, the responses are scored on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher numbers indicating a better quality of life. Integrated AQLQ is the average of the 6-, 9-, and 12- month scores.The proportion of subjects within each group that achieved an AQLQ score change of 0.5 or greater is analyzed.</description>

    <description>Modified Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) Consists of six questions (1 for bronchodilator use and 5 for asthma symptoms). The scores range from 0 (full control) to 6 (seriously uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 average score is the mean of the patient score. The average score ≤ 0.75 indicates that the asthma control is good, 0.75 ~ ≤ 1.5 prompts partial control, &gt; 1.5 prompts poor control. The proportion of subjects within each group that achieved an AQLQ score change of 0.5 or greater was analyzed.</description>
