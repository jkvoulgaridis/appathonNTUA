    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) and transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) on pain and
      analgesic drug consumption in patients who had undergone abdominal surgery with a midline
      incision. Evidence for the effects of and transcutaneous electrical stimulation on pain and
      analgesic consumption on patients undergoing abdominal surgery with severe pain experience
      and high levels of neuroendocrine stress response is uncertain.

      This research was conducted as a randomized controlled trial. 158 patients who had undergone
      abdominal surgery with diagnosis of gastric and colorectal cancer were assessed for
      eligibility. This research sample consisted of 48 patients who underwent abdominal surgery
      with a midline incision. The patients were randomized into three groups, the first
      intervention group, which used TENS (around the incision), the second intervention group,
      which used TAES (ST25, P6, ST36, Lİ4 acupuncture points) and the control group, which did
      not. Electric stimulation was performed at the 30th minute, second, 18th, 21st, 40th, and
      45th hours after the operation. Pain scores and analgesic consumption were assessed in the
      first 48 hours after surgical intervention.

TAES was applied to acupuncture points: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was applied to acupuncture points.
No intervention: No stimulation was performed to the patients.
A standard analgesia protocol for post-operative pain control was used in all patients included in the study. A standard antiemetic protocol was used for all patients after surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>The pain levels were evaluated and compared within postoperative first 48 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>First Intervention Group: Electrical stimulation was implemented at the 30th minute and 2, 18, 22, 42, and 46th hours after the surgery.
Second Intervention Group: Electrical stimulation was implemented at acupuncture points of the patients at the 30th minute and 2, 18, 22, 42, and 46th hours after the surgery.
Control Group: No intervention was performed to the patients in the control group.
The pain intensity of each groups' patients were recorded and compred at the post-operative 2, 18, 22, 42, and 46th hours. Pain intensity was evaluated with VAS. VAS with a range of 1-10 points was used while evaluating the pain intensity of all patients .The increase of the scale score shows that the pain intensity increases.</description>

    <description>The pulmonary functions of the patients were evaluated with a portable spirometer. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced vital capacity (FVC) values were recorded. The measurement of respiratory functions was performed with the patient wrapping the disposable mouthpiece well with the lips during the measurement. The patient was asked to breathe deeply and exhale suddenly and quickly. This process was repeated three times and the best performance was taken as the base value.</description>
