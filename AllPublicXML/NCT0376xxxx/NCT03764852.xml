  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is an increasingly common functional disorder which affects
      approximately 30 to 40% of the female population, 12% of whom have a symptomatic form, with a
      psychological, physical and social impact. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy represents the
      surgical &quot;gold standard&quot; for the treatment of this functional disorder. It aims to suspend
      the vaginal vault by means of a prosthesis. The patient satisfaction rate is evaluated at 94%
      with low overall complication rate, evaluated at 11%.

      Pelvic organ prolapse surgery is a common, with an estimated 30,000 procedures carried out in
      France in 2013 (excluding hysterectomy) (2013 ATIH data), and the number will increase in the
      future due to increasing life expectancy. 13% of women will undergo this type of procedure.
      The French General Directorate of Health Care Supply (DGOS) deems outpatient surgery to be
      the benchmark for surgical activity in all eligible patients, and has expressed the need for
      recommendations and tools for supporting its development. The rate of outpatient surgery for
      prolapse remains low in France (6.1%, 2015 ATIH data), while it is 25% in the US and 56% in
      Denmark. The average duration of hospital stays for DRG N81.2 (first degree uterine prolapse)
      in 2015 was 3.43 days. These procedures have been the subject of publications concerning
      outpatient care and involving low numbers of patients, with the exception of the publication
      by Sinhal which involved 111 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our study, the investigators propose to evaluate the success rate for outpatient
      laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with or without robotic assistance in screened patients. With
      this aim in mind, the investigators will conduct a national multicenter prospective study
      including 80 female patients. Successful outpatient treatment is defined by the absence of
      conventional inpatient admission with 24H after surgery, the indications for admission being
      a CHUNG Score &lt; 9, one perioperative complication, postoperative urinary retention requiring
      reinsertion of a urinary catheter. The outpatient success rate for other surgical techniques
      such as cholecystectomy or laparoscopic hysterectomy is above 90% in the literature.
      Envisaging an equivalent rate after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, our population size would
      make it possible to obtain precision +/- 5.3% for estimation of this proportion. The patients
      are followed up for 1 month with a postoperative visit at 30 days, during which the efficacy
      of the technique is evaluated using conventional indicators (POP-Q; ICIQ, USP, PFDI-20,
      PISQ-12, PFIQ-7, etc.). Once completed, this preliminary investigation will make it possible
      to define a reference value for successful outpatient sacrocolpopexy, which has not yet been
      published, which may be used as a basis for a larger scale randomized study that would aim to
      compare the efficacy of outpatient treatment, with conventional inpatient treatment, for
      efficient patient management
