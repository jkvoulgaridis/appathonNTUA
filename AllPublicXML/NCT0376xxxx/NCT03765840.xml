  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      postoperative cognitive decline is a common and deleterious complication in aged patients.The
      link between inflammation and postoperative cognitive decline has also been
      reported.However,the link between SOD1，SOD2，Osteopontin， Kallikrein-6，and Contactin-1 and
      postoperative cognitive decline is unknown. In this project ,investigators examine the
      relationship between 5 cytokines measured at there timepoints (preoperative [PREOP],
      postoperative day 1 [POD1] , and postoperative day 3[POD2]) and postoperative cognitive
      decline among older adults undergoing orthopedic surgery.
