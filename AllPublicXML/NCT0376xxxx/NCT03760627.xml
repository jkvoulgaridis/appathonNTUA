  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the efficacy of a structured, scalable and replicable psychosocial intervention
      targeting refugees living in Jordan, Amman who have been forced to flee their homes due to
      regional conflicts.

      The study is designed to examine the effects of the Mindfulness Resiliency Training Program
      (MRTP) conducted at Collateral Repair Project (CRP) on the resilience of refugees. The study
      group and the control group will be recruited from refugees currently residing in Amman,
      Jordan who are participating in the MRTP at CRP, an ongoing program independent of our study.

      In order to assess the effect of the MRTP on participant resiliency, the three survey tools
      described above will be used:

        1. the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as a measure of the individual's
           degree of traumatization and

        2. the Child and Youth Resiliency Measure (CYRM-12) (for adolescents) or the Adult
           Resiliency Measure (ARM-12) (for adults) as a measure of resiliency

    <intervention_model_description>This is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The design involves random and sequential crossover of clusters from control to intervention until all clusters are exposed. The controls from the previous session who were available for the parallel portion of the study, will later become the treatment group while another control group is recruited for them, which in turn will become an intervention group and so forth.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Collateral Repair Project (CRP) will conduct a Mindfulness Resiliency Training Program (MRTP) for refugees residing in Amman, Jordan. A small support group will demonstrate to participants techniques that they can use to self-manage their own stress and trauma.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive the training after the study group at 2 months and the control group will then become the study group for the new session. A new group of 20 participants will be recruited who will act as a control for that session. The surveys from the control group will be compared with the study group at 0 and 2 months. Each session will last for two months. The control group will receive the training at the end of the two months. This process will be repeated for a total of nine sessions over a total period of 12 months.</description>
