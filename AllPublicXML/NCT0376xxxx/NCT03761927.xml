  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will perform two different listening tasks: (1) listening to, and repeating
      back, sentence lists presented in noise, and (2) listening to short radio excerpts and
      answering subsequent comprehension questions. At the same time participants are required to
      perform a manual target-tracking task on a touch screen. During this study, continuous,
      non-invasive physiological measurements (heart rate, skin conductance and
      hemoencephalography) will be made from participants. Using this paradigm we will be assessing
      the effect of different hearing aid processing algorithms on listening effort. The study
      takes the form of a three factor (listening task x algorithm x signal-to-noise ratio),
      within-subjects design. Each participant performs each listening task (about 4min long each)
      with each algorithm (reference, noise reduction I, noise reduction II), at two
      signal-to-noise ratios (+4 decibel and 0 decibel) twice (test-retest).

    <measure>Heart rate variability data</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability will be recorded from the participant both before and during the performance of the auditory tasks. Analyses will be carried out relative to the baseline recording (made before the auditory tasks), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity. Heart rate variability will be analysed in both the time [ms] and frequency [ms squared] domains.</description>

    <measure>Skin conductance data</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin conductance will be recorded from the participant both before and during the performance of the auditory tasks. Analyses will be carried out relative to the baseline recording (made before the auditory tasks), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity. It is planned to analyse mean levels of skin conductance [micro-Siemens].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoencephalography data</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoencephalography will be recorded from the participant both before and during the performance of the auditory tasks. Analyses will be carried out relative to the baseline recording (made before the auditory tasks), in order to account for differences in baseline physiological activity. Hemoencephalography will be analysed simply as the ratio of the blue and red light [%] during auditory task performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dual-task performance test 1</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Performance on the secondary tracking task will be analysed in order to observe whether there is a dual-task cost associated with performing both tasks simultaneously. Typically the level of degradation on the secondary task is thought to reflect an increased listening effort (provided that the primary task performance remains stable). Accordingly, success on the primary task will also be monitored and used in analyses (speech intelligibility in [%] correct). For the Secondary task performance the reaction time [ms] will be analysed.</description>

    <description>Performance on the secondary tracking task will be analysed in order to observe whether there is a dual-task cost associated with performing both tasks simultaneously. Typically the level of degradation on the secondary task is thought to reflect an increased listening effort (provided that the primary task performance remains stable). Accordingly, success on the primary task will also be monitored and used in analyses (comprehension questions [numbers] correct after listening to radio excerpts). For the Secondary task performance the reaction time [ms] will be analysed.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Listening Effort rating</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Listening Effort will also be assessed through self-reported individual listening effort on a 14 point scale from &quot;only noise&quot; to &quot;no effort&quot; after each auditory task.</description>
