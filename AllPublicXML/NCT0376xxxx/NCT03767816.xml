  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of erector spinae plane block
      on postoperative visceral pain in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LLC). Given that rectus
      sheath block may provide sufficient somatic pain block, investigators aimed to investigate
      whether erector spinae block is effective in visceral pain block.

      After induction of general anesthesia, group of patient is decided randomly. In Group R,
      rectus sheath block is performed with 0.2% Ropivacaine 30ml before the operation. In Group
      RE, rectus sheath block and erector spinae plane block are performed with 0.2% ropivacaine
      70ml before the operation.

      NRS score measurement and comparison of the rescue analgesic dose used at 0, 0.5, 1, 2,6, 12,
      18, and 24 hours after arrival at the recovery room were collected
