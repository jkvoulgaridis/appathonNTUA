  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on subjects and
      their cancer using hypofractionated proton radiation therapy in combination with
      immunotherapy(ie. Programmed cell death protein 1, also known as PD-1 antibody).
      Hypofractionation is a technique that delivers higher daily doses of radiation over a shorter
      period of time.

    <textblock>
      Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT), also known as Stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) or Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), is a regular pattern of photon
      radiotherapy. HFRT could achieve comparable curative effect to surgery in variable type of
      tumor. With the development of proton radiotherapy technology, proton HFRT technique is
      available nowadays. However, proton HFRT technique is mainly effective in improving the local
      control rates. This study intends to observe the safety and efficacy of proton HFRT technique
      combined with immunotherapy in improving the overall anti-tumor effect.
