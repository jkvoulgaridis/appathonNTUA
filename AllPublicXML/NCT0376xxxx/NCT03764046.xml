  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The numeric rating scale (NRS), one of the most widely used pain scales in clinical practice,
      although convenient, is often subject to bias because it requires abstract thinking from both
      the patient and the evaluator. Compared to numbers, traumatic pain, when visualized
      appropriately, has potential advantage as a means to indicate and communicate the severity of
      pain. Given that they are standardized in terms of body parts, wound size, and bleeding
      volume, illustrations of traumatic pain along with external somatic stimuli that caused it
      can be used to serve as effective visual anchors to supplement a pain scale by giving more
      concrete information to the patient. The purpose of this study is to develop Seoul National
      University Illustrated Pain Scale(SNUIPS) using pictures of traumatic pain, and verify the
      validity and effectiveness of this scale in comparison with those of NRS.
