    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of household-based screening and care encouragement for
      blood pressure on subsequent changes in blood pressure. The study uses a quasi-experimental
      regression discontinuity design with existing population-based secondary data from the 2008,
      2010, 2012, 2014, and 2017 waves of the National Income Dynamics Study in South Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Household-based screening and referral to care for blood pressure may improve blood pressure
      control at the population level in many low- and middle-income countries.

      This observational study will use a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design to
      evaluate the effect of household-based screening for blood pressure with care encouragement
      for potentially hypertensive individuals on subsequent changes in blood pressure over time.

      Individuals had their blood pressure measured in the household as part of the National Income
      Dynamics Study data collection. If individuals had a measured blood pressure in the
      hypertensive zone, they were told that they had elevated blood pressure, that high blood
      pressure can lead to life threatening consequences, and that they should seek further care.
      The study exploits the fact that individuals were given this information based on a hard
      blood pressure cutoff. Therefore, the investigators will evaluate the causal effect of this
      household-based intervention in the absence of randomization by comparing individuals with a
      baseline blood pressure just above and below the cut off.

    <description>For each survey wave, blood pressure is measured at the household by a trained enumerator using an electronic blood pressure device. The enumerators take two separate measurements during the course of the visit with at least three minutes between measurements with individuals in a seated position. The investigators will take the average of the two systolic blood pressure measurements as their main outcome measure.</description>

    <description>The intervention group consists of individuals with a measured blood pressure just above the hypertensive cut-off of 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure who have never previously been diagnosed as hypertensive and are not taking medication to lower their blood pressure. The exact upper bound on blood pressure will be determined empirically. Individuals in the intervention group were told that that their blood pressure was high, that high blood pressure can lead to life threatening consequences, that blood pressure control can reduce these negative consequences, and that they should seek follow-up care for their blood pressure.</description>

    <description>During the household survey visit, survey enumerators collected two measurements of the respondent's blood pressure. If either of the measurements exceeded 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic, enumerators told participants: &quot;Your blood pressure readings are higher than normal. High blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also cause other problems, such as heart failure, kidney disease, and blindness. You can control high blood pressure by taking action.&quot; Then the enumerators recommend that an individual seek medical care within 2 months.</description>

        Individuals will be drawn from the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 waves of the National Income
        Dynamics Study (NIDS) with the 2017 wave used only for follow-up. The NIDS is a nationally
