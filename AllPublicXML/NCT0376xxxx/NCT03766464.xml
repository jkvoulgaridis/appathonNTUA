  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the influence of the sleep bruxism (SB), awake bruxism (AB) and
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular
      disorders (TMD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OSAS is characterized by partial or total obstruction of the upper airways. Bruxism is
      defined as a repetitive activity of the mandibular musculature characterized by the
      tightening or grinding of the teeth and/or by the retrusion or propulsion of the mandible.
      This prospective clinical study will be performed with adults (20 to 60 years) and elderly (&gt;
      60 years) (WHO-World Health Organization) who will be had undergone PSG at the ISP , a
      private medical outpatients clinic from January to December 2019 to evaluate the influence of
      SB, AB and OSAS on signs and symptoms of TMD. The individuals will be assessed clinically and
      diagnosed for TMD using the &quot;Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders&quot;, for SB and
      OSAS using PSG, and AB using the smartphone application. Specific statistical tests will be
      determined after preliminary analysis of the data (α= 0.05).
