  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how insulin 287 works, if it is safe and the side effects in people
      who are Japanese with type 1 diabetes. The study will test how insulin goes through your
      blood, how long it stays there and how the blood sugar is lowered. Insulin 287 is a new
      medicine. Insulin glargine is already approved to treat diabetes. The study doctors can
      prescribe insulin glargine. The participants will get both of the insulins in a random order.
      The participants will get 8 weekly doses of insulin 287 and 14 daily doses of insulin
      glargine. There will also be a run-in period of 2 days to 7 weeks when the participants
      inject insulin glargine every day before they start insulin 287 period or insulin glargine
      period. All doses will be injected under the skin. During the run-in period, the participants
      adjust the insulin glargine dose and make their blood sugar levels stable. From the run-in
      period, the participants will take insulin aspart as bolus insulin. The study will last for
      about 16 - 28 weeks. The participants will have 24 visits with the study doctor. There will
      be 3 glucose clamps where the participants' blood sugar is tested over time. The participants
      cannot be in the study if the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health.

    <description>Number of dilutions.
The antibody titer is calculated by diluting the blood serum sample containing antibody in serial ratios (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16... and so on). Using an appropriate detection method (e.g., colorimetric, chromatographic, etc.), each dilution is tested for the presence of detectable levels of antibody. The assigned titer value is indicative of the last dilution in which the antibody was detected.</description>
