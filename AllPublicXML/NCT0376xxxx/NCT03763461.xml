  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients undergoing awake brain surgery are exposed to non-humidified, non-warmed
      oxygen/air mix flow through a face mask for a prolonged duration. This causes increased
      discomfort, inadequate breathing with the risk for hypoxia perioperatively. Humidified high
      flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy potentially improves patient comfort, oxygen/air
      exchange, improves surgical conditions and prevents atelectasis of the lung, compared to
      traditional oxygen administration using a face mask in patients undergoing awake brain
      surgery.

      Results of this trial will be used to initiate a more extensive, multicenter trial to further
      characterize the potential impact of HFNC.

      Background: Patients undergoing awake brain surgery are exposed to non-humidified, non-warmed
      oxygen/air mix flow through a face mask for a prolonged duration. This causes increased
      discomfort, inadequate breathing with the risk for hypoxia perioperatively.

      Hypothesis: Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy improves patient
      comfort, oxygen/air exchange, improves surgical conditions and prevents atelectasis of the
      lung, compared to traditional oxygen administration using a face mask in patients undergoing
      awake brain surgery.

      Methods: After obtaining ethics approval and written informed patient consent, 20 patients
      undergoing scheduled awake brain surgery will be randomized to either HFNC therapy or
      standard face mask. Evaluation of patient satisfaction, pain / dry upper airway along with
      drawing of arterial blood gases to measure oxygen/carbon dioxide content of the blood will be
      performed during and after the procedure. Lung ultrasound will be performed in the recovery
      room to determine the presence of atelectasis.

      Expected results and Significance: We expect that HFNC improves patient comfort as well as
      breathing / arterial oxygen content in long-duration awake brain surgery. This could result
      in higher patient satisfaction, shorter times in PACU, a shorter requirement for oxygen
      therapy, decreased risk for hypoxia during surgery and better elimination of carbon dioxide -
      which could lead to better surgical conditions due to softer brain tissue and therefore
      shorter time for the surgical procedure. Potential positive results of this trial will be
      used to initiate a more extensive, multicenter trial to further characterize the potential
      impact of HFNC.
