    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of bilateral training for upper
      extremity in stroke patients and to compare these effects between right and left stroke
      patients. A Quasi Experimental Study conducted on community stroke survivors. A total of 24
      stroke patients were included and divided into Group A (Right hemiplegia) (n=12) and Group B
      (Left hemiplegia) (n=12). Chronic stroke patients (&gt;3 months), aged 30-70 years with left or
      right sided diagnosed stroke patients were included while patients on medication that could
      affect the cognitive functions or with any other cognitive impairments who are not able to
      follow commands were excluded. Both groups received the same intervention of with bilateral
      arm training involving 5 functional tasks to improve the functional activities of daily
      living in upper extremities. Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity Tool (FMA-UE) and
      Wolf-Motor Function Test (WMFT) were used to assess as outcome measures.The measurements were
      obtained at baseline and after 6th week of training. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 21.

    <description>Each group received bilateral training) for upper extremities for 3 days per week for 01 hour/day for up to 6 weeks. Tasks included functional tasks such as stacking cones and cups, positioning the cup upright, throw a ball into basket, carrying a wooden block and buttoning and unbuttoning of shirt with counting. Each task was performed for 10 minutes and had a rest break of 1 minute.</description>
