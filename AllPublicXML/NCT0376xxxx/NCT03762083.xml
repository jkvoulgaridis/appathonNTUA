  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-armed, multi-center study to evaluate clinical performance,
      tolerability, and safety of Gedea Pessary in 24 adult women with confirmed BV according to
      fulfillment of at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria. On Day 0, patients will have gynecological
      examination, vaginal samples taken, and will receive the investigational product to be
      self-administered. Patients will be examined after 7 days with respect to 3 Amsel criteria
      (the criterion: &quot;pH of vaginal fluid above 4.5&quot; is only included at study inclusion for
      diagnosis), and if not cured, will receive prolonged treatment for one additional week.
      Patients will be followed-up by telephone up to 29 days after last treatment. Vaginal samples
      will be used for confirming diagnosis and microbiome analyzes. Patient questionnaires will be
      used for assessing BV symptoms, usability, and adverse events (AEs).
