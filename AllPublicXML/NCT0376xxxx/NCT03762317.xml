    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized double blinded study comparing the effect on duration of
      pharmacologic treatment and duration of hospital stay when using clonidine at 12
      µg/kilogram/day as an adjunct to oral morphine as compared to morphine monotherapy in the
      management of term and near term infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an emerging epidemic and has lead to a tremendous
      increase in cost of medical care. Opioids are the mainstay of treatment for NAS although
      there are concerns about possible short-term and long-term effects including but not limited
      to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other drugs such as clonidine, phenobarbitone,
      methadone and buprenorphine have been evaluated to limit the postnatal exposure to opioids in
      these infants. Clonidine is an alpha 2 receptor and can lessen withdrawal manifestations. The
      addition of clonidine at 6 µg/kilogram/day to morphine in the management of NAS has been
      shown to reduce the duration of pharmacotherapy by about 27% in a previous study.

      A recent pilot study reported reduction of treatment duration for NAS with clonidine (12
      µg/kilogram/day) monotherapy as compared to morphine monotherapy. The study reported no
      adverse effects in study subjects at the doses used in the study. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be a minimum of 30% reduction in the treatment duration with 12
      µg/kilogram/day clonidine used as adjuncts to standard morphine treatment as compared to
      morphine monotherapy in the management of term and near term infants with NAS
