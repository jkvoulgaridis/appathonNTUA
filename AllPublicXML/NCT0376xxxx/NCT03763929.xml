  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the potential efficacy and safety of TSC as early treatment for both
      ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke when administered while subject is in ambulance being
      transported to hospital.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial of
      intravenous trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) initiated by emergency medical service (EMS)
      responders in the field within 2 hours of symptom onset in 160 subjects with acute stroke.
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      field-initiated TSC in improving the long-term functional outcome of subjects with acute
      stroke.

      Subjects with acute stroke will be identified and screened in the ambulance by (EMS)
      responders who have received training in basic and advanced cardiac life support, stroke
      recognition, and specific procedures relevant to the proposed study. The EMS responders will
      contact a Study Neurologist, who will enroll eligible stroke patients into the study. Effort
      will be made to obtain prospective informed consent in the ambulance when deemed to be
      feasible. If not feasible, subjects will be enrolled under regulations for exception from
      explicit informed consent (EFIC) in emergency research circumstances, after public disclosure
      and community consultation. Written informed consent to continue in the study is obtained
      from subjects or their legally authorized representatives as soon as possible after hospital
      arrival.

      EMS responders will deliver the single, field, bolus dose of study agent, TSC at 0.25 mg/kg
      or matched placebo, followed after hospital arrival by standard of care (SOC). No additional
      study drug will be administered in the hospital. Follow-up assessments will be performed at
      Emergency Department (ED) arrival, 24 hours, 48 hours, Day 4, Day 30, and Day 90. The study
      will be performed at up to 30 receiving hospital sites in Los Angeles County, CA, and central
      Virginia.

    <measure>Global disability level on the Modified Rankin Score (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a measure of global disability. Total scale range is 0-6, with lower values indicating better outcomes.
0 = No symptoms at all
= No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
= Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance
= Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance
= Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance
= Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention
= Dead</description>

    <measure>Activities of Daily Living (Barthel Index [BI])</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index is a measure of activities of daily living. Total score is calculated by addition of subscale scores. Total score range is 0-100, with higher scores indicating better outcomes. The ten sub-items are:
FEEDING (Range 0-10), BATHING (Range 0-5), GROOMING (Range 0-5), DRESSING (Range 0-10), BOWELS (Range 0-10), BLADDER (Range 0-10), TOILET USE (Range 0-10), TRANSFERS (Range 0-15), MOBILITY (Range 0-15), STAIRS (Range 0-10)</description>

    <measure>Neurologic Deficit (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score [NIHSS])</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a measure of neurologic deficit. Total score range 0-42, with higher scores indicating greater severity. The 11 domains assessed are:
1a-c. Level of Consciousness, 2. Best Gaze, 3. Visual, 4. Facial Palsy, 5a. Motor left arm, 5b. Motor right arm, 6a. Motor left leg, 6b. Motor right leg, 7. Limb Ataxia, 8. Sensory, 9. Best Language, 10. Dysarthria, 11. Extinction and Inattention</description>

    <measure>Qualify of Life (Stroke Impact Scale [SIS-16])</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale - 16 (SIS-16) is a measure of stroke-specific quality of life. The scale assesses 16 questions on a scale from 1 = Could not do at all, to 5 = Not difficult at all. Total scores range from 15-80. Domains assessed are 1. Physical problems, 2. Daily activities, 3. Mobility at home and in the community, and 4. Affected hand use.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (AMC - Linear Disability Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The AMC-Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) is a calibrated generic item bank to measure the physical disability in patients. The ALDS is intended for use after assessing the modified Rankin Score, with different sets of questions for each Rankin score result. There are 15 questions in each level, which ask the patient &quot;Can you...&quot; questions about daily activities and mobility at home and in the community. For example, &quot;Can you carry a bag of shopping upstairs?&quot; The response options are Yes, Yes but it is difficult, No, and I don't know.</description>
