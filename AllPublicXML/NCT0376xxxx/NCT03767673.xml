  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of the clinical research on esophageal atresia focuses on the upper
      gastrointestinal tract. However, the trachea and the lung are also affected in many of these
      children, so that a lifelong pulmonary impairment may result. The importance of respiratory
      function in the context of follow-up of these patients has therefore been increasingly
      recognized in recent years. Scientific work has shown significantly, that patients following
      esophageal atresia repair develop respiratory symptoms more frequently than the normal
      population. Mild impairment of the pulmonary function in adolescence and adulthood was
      demonstrated in some studies, but to date, there is no exact idea about the relationship
      between early childhood disease progression and later pulmonary impairment. Only a few
      scientific papers have dealt with the effect of impaired pulmonary function on the physical
      capacity of these adolescents and adults. Most of these studies show small case numbers,
      inconclusive stress tests, and divergent results.

      The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the cardiopulmonary performance capacity
      and the pulmonary microbiome of adolescent and adult patients with corrected esophageal
      atresia and to compare the results with a control group. Another focus of the investigators
      is on the composition of the pulmonary microbiome of the participants. Changes of the
      pulmonary microbiome and the influence on the cardio-pulmonary performance capacity have not
      yet been investigated. Furthermore, it should be investigated whether the treatment measures
      and a complicated disease course in the neonatal period have long-term effects on lung
      function, exercise capacity and composition of the microbiome in the lungs.

Patients will be subjected to spirometry to determine their age, weight (determined by Kilogram (kg) on a medical weight scale) and Vital Capacity before (initial Spirometry) and after (final Spirometry) exercise performance testing. Bicycle ergospirometer will be applied to determine the Maximum Oxygen Uptake and the Maximum Performance.
