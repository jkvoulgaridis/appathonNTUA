  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes for the trigger event
      of patients who receive triheptanoin in the emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND)
      program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a retrospective chart review of patients in the USA with LC-FAOD who received
      triheptanoin via eIND request from their metabolic or treating physician before 01 September
      2018. Participating study sites will provide the medical records of subjects who meet
      eligibility criteria, and relevant data regarding the trigger event (the reason the patient
      was placed on triheptanoin) and key details about hospitalizations during the study period
      will be extracted.
