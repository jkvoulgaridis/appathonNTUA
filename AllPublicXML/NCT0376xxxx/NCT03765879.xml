    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will examine the analgesic effects of acupuncture imagery
      treatment in patients with chronic low back pain. The intervention used in this study is
      &quot;video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment&quot; (VGAIT) treatment. The control used in this
      study is sham (fake) VGAIT. Participants in each group will participate in 8 study sessions
      (including 6 treatment sessions) over the course of 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure for
      this study is change in low back pain severity score after each treatment session.

    <textblock>
      Low back pain is the one of the most common reasons for all physician visits in the USA and a
      leading cause of disability. However, conventional/pharmacological treatments for chronic low
      back pain (cLBP) have achieved limited success. Imagery is a commonly used therapeutic method
      for many disorders, such as chronic pain and stroke. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains
      unclear. Studies suggest that in addition to directly perceiving one's environment,
      individuals spend considerable time recalling and/or imagining experiences. A large body of
      literature suggests that common brain areas are activated during direct and vicarious
      (observational) experiences. Acupuncture is an invasive treatment that involves needle
      insertion and manipulation. Literature suggests that deqi (sensations evoked by acupuncture
      needle manipulation, such as soreness, aching, and dull pain) are crucial for treatment
      effects. In a recent study, the investigators examined video-guided acupuncture imagery
      treatment (&quot;VGAIT&quot;), during which participants watch a video of acupuncture previously
      administered on their own body while imagining it being concurrently applied. They found that
      this treatment can produce deqi sensations and increase pain thresholds in healthy subjects.
      In this study, the investigators will further investigate the modulation effects of VGAIT on
      patients with chronic pain.

      This study will recruit up to 80 male and female participants, ages 18-60, with a diagnosis
      of chronic low back pain (having low back pain for more than 6 months), until 60 participants
      have finished the study. These participants will be randomly assigned to receive VGAIT or
      sham VGAIT, with 30 in each group.

      We first performed a pilot study in which subjects (up to 25) only received real treatment to
      ensure that the intervention has a treatment effect. In addition, we will also compare the
      results from the pilot study with previous acupuncture studies from our lab to further
      validate the effect of VGAIT. If a treatment effect is evident in this pilot cohort, we will
      begin randomization.

      This study consists of 8 sessions over approximately 6 weeks. These sessions include 2
      assessment sessions (Session 1 and 8) and 6 treatment sessions (Sessions 2-7). The treatment
      sessions will consist of verum VGAIT or sham VGAIT. Verum VGAIT will involve the use of
      acupuncture points commonly used for chronic low back pain. Sham VGAIT will involve the use
      of non-acupoints.

      All study procedures will take place in the department of Psychiatry or the Clinical Research
      Center at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging (Charlestown Navy Yard Campus of
      Massachusetts General Hospital).

    <measure>Changes in back-pain specific disability score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Back-pain specific disability will be measured via the Owestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, an instrument that asks participants to describe their low back pain by checking statements that are most applicable to their pain. The instrument is scored based on disability severity over ten different areas (such as personal care and walking abilities). Higher scores on this instrument indicate more severe disability.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers 18-60 years of age

          -  Meet the Classification Criteria of the chronic low back pain (having low back pain
             for more than 6 months), as determined by the referring physician.

          -  At least 4/10 clinical pain on the 11-point low back pain intensity scale.

          -  Must have had a prior evaluation of their low back pain by a health care provider,
             which may have included radiographic studies. Documentation of this evaluation will be
             sought from Partners or outside medical records and kept in the subject's research
             record.

          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided
             that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment
             measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific causes of back pain (e.g. cancer, fractures, infections),

          -  Complicated back problems (e.g. prior back surgery, medico legal issues),

          -  Possible contraindications for acupuncture (e.g. coagulation disorders, cardiac
             pacemakers, pregnancy, seizure disorder), and conditions that might confound
             longitudinal effects or interpretation of results (e.g. severe fibromyalgia,
             rheumatoid arthritis).

          -  Conditions making study participation difficult (eg, paralysis, psychoses, or other
             severe psychological problems as per the judgment of a study investigator during
             Session 1)

          -  The intent to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study.

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's
             judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for
             adverse outcome. For example: asthma or claustrophobia.

          -  Unresolved medical legal/disability/workers compensation claims in connection with low
             back pain.

          -  Active substance abuse disorder in the past 24 months, as determined by self-report
             and/or urine toxicology

          -  Lacking the capacity to consent for oneself
