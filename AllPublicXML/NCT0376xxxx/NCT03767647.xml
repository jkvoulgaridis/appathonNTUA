      Objectives: Evaluate the effect on emotional intelligence levels of an educational
      intervention.

      Design: Randomized Clinical Trial

      Methods: An intervention on emotional intelligence was conducted in a Primary School.
      Students were recruited and randomized into intervention or control group (no intervention)
      by class (cluster). Total sample was 179. Results were measured with EQi-YV and ERQ-CA
      questionnaires. Statistical analysis was made with Student's t and Mann-Whitney's U tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Elevation of levels of Emotional Intelligence with EQi-YV (&quot;Emotional Quotient Inventory: youth version&quot;) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Increment of at least 3 points of median puntuation of emotional intelligence using EQi-YV questionnaire. Range of puntuations: 60-240 points. EQi-YV is the method in Spanish with higher internal and external validity to measure emotional intelligence in children and teenager population. The participants must show their degree of agreement with 60 items on a Likert scale of 4 points (1: never happens to me, 4: it always happens to me). It consists of 5 subscales: general mood, adaptability, stress management, interpersonal skills and intrapersonal skills. All negative punctuations were positivized for analisis (5-n). Total value is obtained by the sum of the items and reflects the level of emotional intelligence. A higher value means a better condition for the patient.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Elevation of levels of Emotional Intelligence with ERQ-CA (&quot;Emotional Regulation Questionary&quot;) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Increment of at least 2 points of median emotional intelligence using ERQ-CA questionnaire. The ERQ-CA measures emotional regulation capacity, it has been validated in Spanish. ERQ-CA consists on 10 Likert items on a scale of 5 points (1: never happens to me; 5: it always happens to me). It is formed of two subscales: cognitive re-evaluation and emotional suppression. Total puntuation is obtained by the sum of the items and varies from 10 to 50. All negative puntuations were positivized for analisis (6-n). A higher value means a better condition for the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Elevation of levels of general mood subscale with EQi-YV (&quot;Emotional Quotient Inventory: youth version&quot;) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Increment of at least 1.5 points of median puntuation of general mood subscale using EQi-YV questionnaire. Range of puntuations 14-56. The participants must show their degree of agreement with items on a Likert scale of 4 points (1: never happens to me, 4: it always happens to me). It consists on 14 items of general mood (items 1, 4, 9, 13,19, 23, 29, 32, 37, 40, 47, 50, 56, 60). All negative punctuations were positivized for analisis (5-n). Total value represents the level of general mood. A higher value means a better condition for the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Elevation of levels of adaptability subscale with EQi-YV (&quot;Emotional Quotient Inventory: youth version&quot;) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Increment of at least 1.5 points of median puntuation of adaptability subscale using EQi-YV questionnaire. Range of puntuations 10-40. The participants must show their degree of agreement with items on a Likert scale of 4 points (1: never happens to me, 4: it always happens to me). It consists on 10 items of adaptability (items 12, 16, 22, 25, 30, 34, 38, 44, 48, 57). All negative punctuations were positivized for analisis (5-n). Total value represents the level of adaptability. A higher value means a better condition for the patient.</description>

    <measure>Elevation of levels of stress management subscale with EQi-YV (&quot;Emotional Quotient Inventory: youth version&quot;) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Increment of at least 1.5 points of median puntuation of stress management subscale using EQi-YV questionnaire. Range of puntuations 12-48. The participants must show their degree of agreement with items on a Likert scale of 4 points (1: never happens to me, 4: it always happens to me). It consists on 12 items of stress management (items 3, 6, 11, 15, 21, 26, 35, 39, 46, 49, 54, 58). All negative punctuations were positivized for analisis (5-n). Total value represents the level of stress management. A higher value means a better condition for the patient.</description>

It consists on 6 items of intrapersonal skills (items 7, 17, 28, 31, 43, 53). All negative punctuations were positivized for analisis (5-n). Total value represents the level of intrapersonal skills.
