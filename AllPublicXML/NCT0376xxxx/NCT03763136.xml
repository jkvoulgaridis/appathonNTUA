  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure has a high morbidity and mortality because the heart is one of the least
      regenerative organs in a human body. Drug treatments for heart failure manage symptoms but do
      not restore lost myocytes. Cellular replacement therapy is a potential approach to repair
      damaged myocardial tissue, restore cardiac function, which has become a new strategy for the
      treatment of heart failure. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility
      and efficacy of intramyocardial delivery of regenerated cardiomyocytes at the time of
      coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure will be treated with allogenic human induced pluripotent stem
      cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hPSC-CM ) from healthy donors. The cells will be injected
      directly into the myocardium at time of coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients will be
      assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months after cell transplantation for safety, feasibility and
      efficacy.

    <description>Accurately measuring VO2 max involves a physical effort sufficient in duration and intensity to fully tax the aerobic energy system. In general clinical and athletic testing, this usually involves a graded exercise test (either on a treadmill or on a cycle ergometer) in which exercise intensity is progressively increased while measuring:
ventilation and oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled air. VO2 max is reached when oxygen consumption remains at a steady state despite an increase in workload.</description>
