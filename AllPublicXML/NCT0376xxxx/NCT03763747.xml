      A prospective, open label, multi-center, single arm, observational study designed to evaluate
      the acute safety and device procedural success of the Scoreflex NC Scoring PTCA catheters in
      subjects with stenotic coronary arteries during percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Two-hundred (200) subjects will be treated at up to 15 U.S. sites with the Scoreflex NC
      Scoring PTCA catheter during their index procedure. All subjects will be screened according
      to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be followed through hospital
      discharge.

             this study.

          4. Subjects must have a single or double vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and
             clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, such as CAD, stable / unstable angina or
