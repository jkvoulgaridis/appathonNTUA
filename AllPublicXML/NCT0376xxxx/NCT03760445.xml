  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center open-label Phase I/II study investigating orally administered HDM201
      in combination with chemotherapy in two populations: subjects with first line AML or subjects
      with relapsed/refractory AML. This study is conducted in three parts: dose escalation, dose
      expansion and DDI study.
