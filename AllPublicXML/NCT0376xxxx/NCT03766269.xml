  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 12-week, open-label trial that is designed to evaluate the
      Opioid-Sparing effect of Dronabinol at ranging doses when coadministered with the opioid
      analgesics that are currently being prescribed to patients for their chronic pain condition.
      The purpose of this trial will be to assess the effectiveness of Dronabinol when combined
      with opioid analgesics to relieve pain at lower opioid doses and to evaluate any reduction of
      opioid-related side effects. Participants will take the study-drug, Dronabinol, along with
      their regular prescribed opioids and the results will be evaluated and analyzed according to
      defined endpoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Week one of the study is a Baseline Period during which time, baseline data related to opioid
      dose and frequency, mood, sleep, bowel movements, and pain intensity will be collected.
      Participants will receive no Dronabinol during week one and will continue to take their
      stabilized dose of regular prescribed opioids, both baseline and rescue.

      Weeks two through four is the Titration Period, during which time study participants will
      titrate the Dronabinol dose up to a daily dose of 20 mg of Dronabinol per day, according to a
      prearranged titration table. Participants will continue to take their stabilized dose of
      regular prescribed opioids, both baseline and rescue. Participants will be encouraged to
      maintain the 20mg daily total dose of Dronabinol. Participants may also reduce their dose of
      Dronabinol at any time (if they experience severe adverse effects) to a minimum daily dose of
      Dronabinol of 10mg per day. Participants who cannot tolerate at least a minimum daily dose of
      10mg of Dronabinol per day will be discontinued from the study.

      Weeks five through twelve is the Opioid-Sparing Period, during which time participants will
      be encouraged to maintain the stabilized dose of Dronabinol that they &quot;found&quot; during the
      Study-Drug Dose Finding Period. Study Participants will continue to take their regular
      prescribed opioids, but will be encouraged to reduce their opioid dose and/or opioid dose
      frequency at any time during the remainder of the study should they experience a reduction in
      pain and/or an improvement in opioid-related side effects.

    <time_frame>Daily (Days 1-82)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in pain intensity from baseline using the Opioid Sparing Diary Toolkit. The measurement of the pain intensity will be derived from the Brief Pain Inventory (Short-Form) item #3. &quot;Please rate your pain by marking the box beside the number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours.&quot; The score is reported as a value between 0 and 10, with 0 indicative of no pain, and 10 indicative of &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The score will be considered a continuous level of measurement.</description>

    <description>To measure the change in depression and generalized anxiety from baseline. The HADS measures levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to a factor that measures anxiety and seven relate to a factor that measures depression. The seven items for each factor are summed into a total score and range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicative of greater anxiety/depression. The scores will be analyzed as continuous level variables and one-sided paired-samples t-tests will be used to compare mean scores for anxiety and depression for all subjects between Week 1 (baseline) and Week 12 (EOS).</description>
