  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the second-line treatment of patients with non-T790M mutations, chemotherapy with
      platinum-containing drugs was used, and chemotherapy-related toxicity was high. Studies have
      shown that bevacizumab combined with EGFR TKI have a good trend of benefit. This study is
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride combined with
      first-generation EGFR TKIs as second-line treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer .
      The patients with IV non-small lung cancer have acquired resistance to prior first-generation
      EGFR TKIs and have non-T790M mutation.
