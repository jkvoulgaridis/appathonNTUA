  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center clinical study is being conducted over the course of 2 weeks to conduct an
      exploratory pilot study as a preliminary evaluation of D-OCT's ability to measure skin
      changes from aging. Assess structural differences between young and aged skin on the face. To
      identify the structural characteristics of atrophic acne scars relative to normal skin on the
      face. To explore characteristics of cellulite relative to normal skin on the thigh in young
      and aged skin.
