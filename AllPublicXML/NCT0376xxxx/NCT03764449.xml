    <textblock>
      This study was a non-randomized, open-label, parallel group, two-treatment study in healthy
      volunteers to investigate the absolute oral bioavailability of balovaptan. The study was
      conducted at 1 site in the Netherlands.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects. Healthy status is defined by absence of evidence of
             any active or chronic disease following a detailed medical and surgical history, a
             complete physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG, hematology, blood
             chemistry, urinalysis, and serology.

          -  Body Mass Index of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to use at least 2 acceptable
             contraceptive methods during the treatment period and for 90 days after the last dose
             of study drug.

          -  For men: agreement to use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from
             donating sperm until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Any condition or disease detected during the medical interview/physical examination
             that would render the subject unsuitable for the study, place the subject at undue
             risk or interfere with the ability of the subject to complete the study in the opinion
             of the Investigator.
