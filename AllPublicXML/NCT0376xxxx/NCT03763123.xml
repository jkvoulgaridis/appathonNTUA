  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Humanized Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody (Sevacizumab)
      Injection in combination with Chemotherapy in Chinese patients with Platinum-Resistant
      Recurrent Ovarian Cancer. This study includes two stages. Stage 1 is the dose-escalation
      stage. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD of Sevacizumab has been established, additional
      patients will be enrolled in the cohort-expansion stage (Stage 2).
