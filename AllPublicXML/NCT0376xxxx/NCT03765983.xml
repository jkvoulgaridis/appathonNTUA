  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called GDC-0084 as a possible treatment for
      HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  GDC-0084

        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved GDC-0084 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      Trastuzumab is a targeted therapy approved by the FDA to be used alone or in combination with
      a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

      GDC-0084 has been shown to stop the activity of a protein called PI3-kinase. This action
      blocks a pathway in the body that cancer cells commonly use to grow and divide.

      Trastuzumab is called a &quot;targeted therapy&quot; because it works by attaching itself to specific
      receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When targeted
      therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and
      the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the immune system. This process allows
      trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how your cancer responds to the
      combination of GDC-0084 and Trastuzumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Visceral crisis or impending visceral crisis at time of screening.

          -  CNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g.,
             resection, shunt placement).

          -  Known leptomeningeal metastases [Defined as positive CSF cytology and/or unequivocal
             radiological evidence of clinically significant leptomeningeal involvement. CSF
             sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to exclude
             leptomeningeal involvement].

          -  Patients with known contraindication to MRI (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic
             implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity, hypersensitivity, etc.). However, head CT
             with contrast may be used in place of MRI at baseline and throughout the trial if MRI
             is contraindicated and a participant's brain metastases are clearly measurable by head
             CT.

          -  Chemotherapy or targeted therapy within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol
             therapy. No washout is required for trastuzumab.

          -  Has received prior therapy with a PI3K or mTOR inhibitor.

          -  No washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on ovarian
             suppression for at least 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, continuation
             of ovarian suppression is permitted on protocol. Starting a new endocrine therapy
             during protocol therapy is not permitted.

          -  Current use or history of receiving a non-approved, investigational treatment within
             14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy.

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic
             composition to GDC-0084 or any constituent of the product.

          -  The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association
             Class III or IV, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the
             previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), gastric or duodenal
             ulceration diagnosed within the previous 6 months, chronic liver or renal disease, or
             severe malnutrition. If a participant has controlled DM but is unable to monitor blood
             sugars at home, they will be excluded from the trial.

          -  The subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  No active, second potentially life-threatening cancer.

          -  Has had major surgery within 21 days before initiation of protocol therapy.

          -  Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs,
             resulting in dyspnea at rest.

          -  Known intolerance to trastuzumab.

          -  QT interval time of ≥ 470 msec.

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these
             agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no
             washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Please see Appendix M for
             the list of medications. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed.
             Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product
