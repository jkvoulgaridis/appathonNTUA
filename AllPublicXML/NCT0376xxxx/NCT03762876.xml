      Changes in trans-hepatic flow after major and extended hepatectomy (EH) can lead to small for
      size and flow syndrome (SFSF), which is associated with a significantly higher rate of
      morbidity and mortality. The current therapies for SFSF are not effective because tissue
      damage following SFSF is usually irreversible and the liver parenchyma loses the ability to
      regenerate. Therefore, the best approach to improve patient survival is to predict SFSF and
      perform adequate intraoperative preventive procedures.

      Portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), and portal vein pressure (PVP) are the
      main criteria for development of SFSF after living donor liver transplantation. The
      mechanisms that change trans-hepatic flow are similar after hepatectomy and living donor
      liver transplantation. Trans-hepatic flow is routinely measured during liver resection, but
      the effect of these changes on SFSF has not been studied. Identifying the factors that alter
      trans-hepatic flow after hepatectomy would allow hepatic inflow to be modulated before and
      after surgery, to prevent SFSF.

      Trans-hepatic flow and pressure parameters (PVF, HAF, and PVP) are routinely measured and
      monitored during liver resection. The aim of the proposed study is to analyze changes in
      these parameters after major hepatectomy and determine the factors that alter trans-hepatic
      flow after hepatectomy.

    <textblock>
      Liver resection is an efficient treatment for primary and secondary hepatic tumors and
      increases long term survival. Improvements in patient selection criteria, surgical methods,
      and postoperative care have increased the indications for major and extended hepatectomy
      (EH). Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a major complication following EH and is
      called small for size and flow syndrome (SFSF). SFSF significantly increases morbidity and
      mortality. The current SFSF treatments are not effective because tissue damage following SFSF
      is irreversible and the liver parenchyma loses the ability to regenerate. The best approach
      to improve patient survival is to predict SFSF and perform adequate preventive procedures
      during liver resection. SFSF is caused by changes in trans-hepatic flow and a low future
      liver remnant volume. Portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), and portal vein
      pressure (PVP) are the main criteria for SFSF development. Following EH, the ratio of HAF to
      the remnant liver weight (HAF/100gr) decreases, while the PVF/100gr and the PVP increase.
      This has various pathologic consequences, which lead to SFSF. Troisi et al. suggested an
      upper limit of 250 ml/min/100g for PVF to prevent SFSF after living donor liver
      transplantation. A vascular modulation that decreases the PVF/100gr and PVP and increases the
      HAF/100gr may prevent SFSF. The mechanisms that alter trans-hepatic flow after hepatectomy
      and living donor transplantation are similar, but the effect of these changes on SFSF has not
      been studied following liver resection. Exploring the changes in trans-hepatic flow after
      major and extended hepatectomy and determining the factors that influence these changes would
      allow us to modulate hepatic inflow during hepatectomy to prevent PHLF.
