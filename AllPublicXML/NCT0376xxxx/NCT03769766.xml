  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to determine if the use of curcumin randomized against placebo
      will reduce cancer progression in patients with prostate cancer undergoing active
      surveillance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men with an estimated 180,890 new cases and
      26,120 deaths from prostate cancer expected in 2016 in the United States. Although the
      lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer, the risk of death is only about 3%. A major
      concern regarding the utility of prostate cancer screening is the risk of over diagnosis and
      subsequent overtreatment. Many patients with small low grade cancers might not benefit from
      treatment and treatment can result in lower quality of life. A major concern for patients and
      physicians using active surveillance (AS) is the risk for progression of disease. Several
      reviews of active surveillance suggest that stage or grade progression occur in approximately
      30% of patients with some patients choosing treatment due to anxiety. Overall survival in AS
      series is uniformly high but the need for close monitoring and anxiety associated with risk
      of progression has inhibited use among patients.

      There are no currently accepted medications to reduce risk of progression in patients with
      active surveillance. With the rising use of AS, there is a role for therapies to reduce risk
      for progression in this population. One promising source of therapies involves use of
      nutraceuticals for the prevention and treatment of human diseases. Curcumin is a widely
      studied nutraceutical that was first discovered about two centuries ago from the rhizomes of
      Curcuma longa (turmeric). Curcumin is a safe supplement and in this study we will evaluate if
      it reduces risk of cancer progression compared to placebo.
