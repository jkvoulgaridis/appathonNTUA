  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely recognized that asthma in adult African American patients is a significant
      health problem, which is partly affected by relatively low inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
      adherence rates. The goal of this study is to pilot test an ICS adherence intervention,
      ARICA, that aims to improve ICS adherence in adult African Americans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate ARICA in Duke primary care clinics to study its feasibility
      and acceptability using a quasi-experimental pre-post study design. The study will enroll
      between 32 and 48 adult African Americans with persistent asthma and suboptimal ICS
      adherence, and their health care providers, to study the use of the intervention and key
      indicators of the intervention's potential effectiveness.
