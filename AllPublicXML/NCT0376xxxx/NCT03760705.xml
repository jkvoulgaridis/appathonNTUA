  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project aims to perform data extraction, integration and analysis across
      multiple clinical, administrative, financial and pharmacy databases in the participating
      institutions. The key data components will include clinical cardiovascular specific data,
      procedural data, financial and administrative data (e.g. cost of medications and supplies,
      length of stay, diagnosis codes etc.), short-to-long term clinical outcomes (including
      hospital re-admissions, cardiovascular events, death), and quality-of-care indices (e.g.
      compliance to guideline-recommended therapy and medications). The research project will
      involve all patients proven and/or suspected with coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive
      heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) admitted to National Heart Centre Singapore
      (NHCS) and NUH.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research project is initiated by NHCS and its participating institutions include Ministry
      of Health (MOH), as well as National University Hospital (Singapore) Pte Ltd (NUH), Changi
      General Hospital (CGH), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH), Tan
      Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH) , SingHealth Polyclinics,
      National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP), Sengkang Hospital (SKH), National University
      Polyclinics (NUP), and Alexandra Hospital (AH).

      The research project will leverage on the Health Data Grid (HDG) pilot project, now known as
      Business Research Analytics Insights Network (BRAIN). BRAIN will be a virtual repository that
      will enable access to anonymised and merged data from disparate databases at multiple
      institutions. The structures of BRAIN will preserve patients' privacy and confidentiality,
      ensure IT security and allow access only by authorised persons. The BRAIN pilot project will
      be co-funded by MOH and the Infocommunication Media Development Authority of Singapore
      (IMDA). To avoid doubt, after the BRAIN pilot project, a separate approval from the
      appropriate stakeholders will have to be sought for further funding of the operating costs of
      the BRAIN, regardless of whether the value of the BRAIN has been demonstrated during the
      BRAIN pilot project. There is no direct cost involved in the research project.

      For the research project, MOH will contribute administrative data from the Registry of Births
      and Deaths, Casemix &amp; Subvention, the Mediclaim, and Omnibus databases, and the other
      participating institutions will contribute the data from the National Electronic Health
      Records (NEHR), Electronic Health Intelligence System (eHIntS) and Enterprise Data Warehouse
      (EDW) to BRAIN. Only anonymised data from BRAIN will be utilised for the research project.
