  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2007 and 2013, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines applied the
      diagnostic criteria of sMPLC （synchronous multiple primary lung cancers）, and the diagnostic
      criteria of Martini and Melamed were extended and developed, Summarized as: (1) different
      histological types, different genetic characteristics, or different origin of carcinoma in
      situ; (2) the histological type is the same, the tumor is located in different lung or
      different lung lobes, the common lymphatic drainage site of lung cancer is not cancerous, and
      there is no extrapulmonary metastasis at the time of diagnosis.

      Postoperative staging of each tumor was carried out in sMPLC patients, if all of them were
      stage I lung adenocarcinoma, whether adjuvant therapy could fully refer to the treatment
      principle of stage I NSCLC was considered, whether the benefit of subsequent application of
      adjuvant chemotherapy was still unclear, and whether adjuvant therapy was needed or not has
      been determined.

      High-throughput sequencing, also known as &quot;Next generation&quot; sequencing (NGS), is
      characterized by sequencing of hundreds of thousands to millions of DNA molecules in
      parallel, and generally shorter reads.For multiple tumor lesions resected by sMPLC, only
      biopsy gene information from a single cancer focus may not be enough to identify all active
      driver gene mutations from the tumor. Therefore, NGS sequencing was proposed for all cancer
      lesions of sMPLC patients to reflect the full picture of gene mutation in such patients.

      The investigators initiated this prospective clinical study to detect lung cancer related
      genes in tumor tissues and patients with at least 2 tumors that were confirmed as invasive
      adenocarcinoma by pathology after sMPLC resection (residual non-resectable or non-qualitative
      pulmonary nodules). At the same time, application of NGS technology to test lung cancer
      related genes in patients' tumor tissues and blood, patients with lung cancer drive genes
      were followed up to explore whether different drive genes had an impact on patients' disease
      progression. In order to investigate the type of gene that causes disease recurrence in
      patients, tissue or blood test was performed again when disease recurrence occur.
