  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence rates of childhood obesity have reached alarming levels. As childhood obesity may
      already be associated with serious comorbidities, obese adolescents are at significantly
      higher risk for obesity and increased morbidity and mortality during adulthood. Combined
      lifestyle interventions, which include regular physical activity and dietary restriction,
      have been shown to result in most significant improvements in cardiovascular function and
      their associated factors in the pediatric and adolescent population with obesity. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the effects of a combined exercise and diet intervention on
      cardiovascular function and their associated factors in obese children.

      Sixty obese children and adolescents will complete a 6-week program of exercise and diet
      intervention. Thirty normal-weight children and adolescents will be recruited as control
      group. Clinical characteristics, body composition, blood biochemistry, and circulating irisin
      levels of the subjects will be measured before and after 6-week intervention. Endothelial
      function will be assessed by a flow-mediated dilation test. Circulating exosome-derived
      miRNAs, exercise-induced epigenetic modifications, circulating irisin levels irisin
      concentration in plasma and arterial stiffness as well as cardiac autonomic function will be
      investigated before and after the 6-week intervention. Fecal samples were collected before
      and after the 6-week intervention for analysis of the compositional and functional changes in
      the human gut microbiota.

    <description>Subjects were provided with energy-restricted diets of 1300-2200 kcal/day based on weight. The energy percentages provided by protein, fat and carbohydrate were 20%, 20% and 60%, respectively, while energy distributions at breakfast, lunch and dinner were 30%, 40% and 30%, respectively. Subjects performed a series of endurance exercise such as bicycling, walking, running, dancing and ball games for 5 hour/day, supplemented with resistance exercise. Training interventions were performed 5-6 day/week for 6 weeks. The exercise program was designed to result in an energy expenditure of 1500-2500 kcal/day.</description>
