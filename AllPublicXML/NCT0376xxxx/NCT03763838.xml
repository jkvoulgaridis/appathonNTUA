  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if accupressure can help reduce the severity of fatigue
      experienced by ovarian cancer patients. Acupressure involves applying mild to moderate
      physical pressure by fingers, hand or a device to specific points on the skin to try to bring
      about a change in the body's functioning, in this case relief from chronic fatigue.
