  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether the routine collection of patient-contextual data improves patient
      activation and communication, and can mitigate racial disparities in communication and
      engagement, we are inviting patients who have upcoming appointments at the participating
      health system to participate in a communication study. Patients will be randomized to having
      guided (facilitated) enrollment in a tool that collects patient contextual data, or to usual
      care. All patients are invited directly by the health system to use the tool. Statistical
      methods will be used to determine the impact of the tool's use on outcomes of interest, as
      well as the impact on completion by the use of the facilitated enrollment. The study will
      particularly focus on assessing the impact of patient-contextual data and communication on
      heath disparities.
