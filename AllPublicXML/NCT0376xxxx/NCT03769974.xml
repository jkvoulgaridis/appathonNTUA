  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to evaluate and quantify successes and errors, as well
      as execution time, in a sequence of manual motor gestures of increasing complexity through
      mental practice training (observation of actions and motor imagery).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The motor programs stored in the procedural memory systems allow the generation of motor
      mental images without the need for an external stimulus, although it has been demonstrated
      that providing visual information, prior to a task of imagination, facilitates it and causes
      a greater neurophysiological activity than if it were done in an isolated manner. Some
      studies have shown that in the short term, in complex motor tasks of foot and hand in a
      coordinated manner, the action observation training provokes a greater motor learning
      compared to the motor imagery strategy.

      However, these studies have only assessed short-term memory immediately after the
      intervention. No study has so far evaluated these improvements in motor learning through
      action observation training and motor imagery on consecutive days, nor has it been evaluated
      with short to medium-term follow-up.

      It is therefore that there is a lack in the current scientific literature regarding which
      isolated method, without physical practice, of mental practice on motor learning is the most
      effective when exposed both on consecutive days, as well as to short-medium-term follow-up.

    <measure>Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability will be measured with MIQ-R Questionnaire. MIQ-R has 4 movements repeated in two subscales, a visual and a kinaesthetic one. Additionally, a score between 1 and 7 is assigned, with 1 representing difficulty in picturing the motor image or difficulty in feeling the movement previously made, and 7 representing the maximum ease. A modification was made in the MIQ-R. Items 2 and 5, in which a small jump is made, were changed by standing on tiptoe. The internal consistencies of the MIQ-R have been consistently adequate with Cronbach's α coefficients ranging above 0.84 for the total scale, 0.80 for de visual subscale and 0.84 for the kinesthetic subscale.</description>

    <measure>Mental Chronometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Mental chronometry evaluation was also used to measure the subject's motor imagery ability. Using a stopwatch, the time spent for performing each MIQ-R task was recorded. Time recorded corresponds to the interval between the command to start the task, given by the evaluator, and the verbal response of conclusion of the task, given by the subject. Mental chronometry is a reliable behavioral task that has previously been employed to collect an objective measure of MI ability</description>

    <measure>The degree of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of physical activity was objectified through the The International Physical Activity Questionnaire questionnaire, which allows the subjects to be divided into three groups according to their level of activity, which can be high, moderate, and low or inactive</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Laterality task</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>With the task of recognition of the hand's laterality, two aspects will be evaluated: first, the precision (percentage of correct answers) of the discrimination of the laterality which is the capacity to recognize if a part of the body belongs to the right or left hemicorpse and second, the response time that the participants use in the task of discrimination or cognitive judgment. The app designed and developed by the NOI group will be used.</description>

    <measure>Memory Operation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The allows a cognitive evaluation of everyday memory failures. The questionnaire contains four subscales: daily memory, text recall, past memories and mnemonic strategies. The memory functioning questionnaire has adequate psychometric properties of validity and reliability obtained. An acceptable internal consistency was obtained, with a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the total scale of 0.818 memory operation questionnaire</description>
