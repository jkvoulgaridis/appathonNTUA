  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become the leading fatal infectious disease in the
      United States. Approximately 75% of individuals who have been infected with HCV are
      chronically infected with the virus. Untreated chronic infection will lead to severe sequelae
      such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Even though the availability of rapid HCV
      antibody (HCV Ab) screening assay and highly effective antiviral treatment, most people
      infected with HCV are not aware of the infection status. This gap mainly comes from the
      current gold standard confirmatory testing for chronic HCV infection, the Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR)-based HCV RNA viral load assay which requires an experienced trained
      laboratory technician to perform relatively complicated PCR assay with a turn-around-time of
      1 to 2 days (from provider's order to the test resulting). The investigators' rapid HCV
      Screening and Linkage to Care program has demonstrated that many patients in the
      investigators' emergency department (ED) are unaware of patient's chronic HCV infection
      status due to the barriers to receive the gold standard viral load testing.

      Recently, a novel Xpert HCV Viral Load (VL) Finger-stick (FS) [Xpert HCV VL FS] point-of-care
      (POC) test (Cepheid) has been developed. In an observational cohort in Australia, HCV RNA was
      detected in 40% of participants (85 of 210) enrolled at 3 drug treatment clinics and 1
      homelessness service. Sensitivity of the Xpert HCV VL FS assay for HCV RNA quantification in
      samples collected by finger-stick was 100.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 93.9%-100.0%) and
      specificity was 100.0% (95% CI, 96.6%-100.0%). The Xpert HCV VL FS test can accurately detect
      active infection from a finger-stick sample in 1 hour allowing single-visit HCV diagnosis.

      In this protocol, the investigators seek to determine the needs and acceptability of a novel
      POC HCV viral load testing assay among ED HCV Ab positive patients. For this project, the
      investigators will identify and enroll ED patients with HCV Ab positive but without HCV viral
      information. The investigators will conduct a randomized study to assign eligible and
      consented patients to either to POC Testing Group or Standard of Care (SOC) Group. All
      participants will take a short survey regarding HCV care and treatment. As part of the
      investigators' ED HCV Screening and Linkage to Care Program, all participants will receive
      the standard-of-care clinical laboratory-based HCV RNA viral load testing via whole blood
      (i.e. patient will receive blood drawn). This standard-of-care HCV viral load testing result
      will be provided to participant when it is available (usually 1-2 days later). Participants
      in the POC Testing Group will receive the novel POC HCV RNA viral load testing and the result
      of the novel test will be disclosed to the patients approximately within 2 hours of the
      testing. Linkage to care information after the ED visit will be compared between two groups.
      Finally, accuracy of this POC HCV RNA viral load testing in the acute care setting will be
      determined as compared to the standard-of-care clinical laboratory-based HCV RNA viral load
      testing. The investigators will also ask all of participants to grant permission to use the
      remnant blood specimens for an evaluation of future in-house HCV RNA viral load assay.

      Johns Hopkins Emergency Department-Based Rapid HCV Screening and Linkage to Care Program

      Johns Hopkins Hospital Emergency Department (JHHED) has implemented an ED-based rapid HCV
      Screening and Linkage to Care Program since late 2015, after adapting the 2012 Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revised HCV testing recommendations. The investigators'
      program utilizes an integrated, triage nurse driven model to deliver opt-out HCV testing to
      eligible ED patients. Eligibility was facilitated by electronic health record (EHR) prompts
      to identify patients over the age of 17 years and no HCV testing history at the institution.
      For patients who were medically/surgically stable and who did not have altered mental status,
      an opt-out HCV Ab test offering was delivered by staff. JHHED utilizes the blood-based
      anti-HCV assay (Abbott Architect) and fingerstick POC HCV assay (OraSure) for HCV Ab testing,
      depending on the availability of patient's whole blood drawn for his/her ED care. HCV reflex
      RNA testing is performed for HCV Ab reactive patients tested by blood-based HCV Ab assay.
      Blood specimens for HCV RNA testing are collected during the ED visit (if possible) for HCV
      Ab reactive patients tested by POC HCV Ab assay with confirmatory testing performed
      asynchronous to the ED visit. JHHED utilized dedicated linkage to care program staff that
      contacted ED patients with HCV Ab reactive results to deliver confirmatory results and
      facilitate referral to HCV care. The investigators' program staff also identify HCV Ab
      positive patients without HCV RNA viral load information by screening the ED tracking board
      (EPIC) to inform ED providers of ordering HCV RNA viral load testing which might need to have
      blood drawing if there is no blood work ordered in place.

      Routine Care All JHHED patients are eligible for HCV screening or linkage to care service
      under the investigators' ED-based rapid HCV Screening and Linkage to Care Program if
      participants are 18 years and older, no history of HCV diagnosis or testing, and do not have
      altered mental status. Please see the brief description of the investigators' program above.

      Recruitment A. Steps for recruiting participants with known HCV antibody positive but no HCV
      viral load data

        1. The ED HCV Screening and Linkage to Care (LTC) Program will screen the ED tracking board
           (EPIC) for patients who potentially meet study enrollment criteria (i.e. not possessing
           any exclusion criteria), which is done routinely as a part of standard of care. The ED
           HCV Screening and LTC team will notify the research coordinator of all eligible
           patients.

        2. Research coordinator will then approach the treating ED clinician for his/her patients
           regarding the research opportunity in the investigators' study.

        3. Providers may refer eligible patients to research coordinator after getting permission
           from patients. Providers who are part of the investigators' study team will refer the
           eligible patients to research coordinator after patients agree to be approached by the
           investigators' research coordinator regarding the investigators' study.

      For providers who are not in the investigators' study team, the recruitment procedure will be
      that the patient's clinician will request permission from patients and document in the chart
      regarding the patient's permission to be contacted by the research staff.

      B. Steps for recruiting participants with newly diagnosed HCV antibody positive identified
      from ED HCV Screening and Linkage to Care Program

        1. Research coordinator will work closely with ED HCV Screening and Linkage to Care Program
           staff to recruit this subgroup of ED patients. Screening Program staff will notify the
           research coordinator via pager (or equivalent) when an ED patient is diagnosed with HCV
           Ab reactive result via the Screening Program.

        2. Research coordinator will then approach the treating ED clinician for his/her patients
           regarding the research opportunity in the investigators' study.

        3. Providers may refer eligible patients to research coordinator after getting permission
           from patients. Providers who are part of the investigators' study team will refer the
           eligible patients to research coordinator after patients agree to be approached by the
           investigators' research coordinator regarding the study.

      For providers who are not in the investigators' study team, the recruitment procedure will be
      that the patient's clinician will request permission from patients and document in the chart
      regarding the patient's permission to be contacted by the research staff.

      Enrollment The research coordinator will obtain oral, informed consent. The process will
      involve a description of the study as provided in the verbal consent form with a chance to
      provide answers to any questions about the study. Justification for verbal consent is
      provided in the electronic Institutional Review Board (e-IRB) application. Specifically, this
      study poses minimal risk to patients. The consent process will take between approximately
      15-20 minutes, based on the requirements of the individual patient.

      Consented subjects will be given a copy of the oral consent document for participant's
      information and records. In this consent, the patient will be asked for permission to review
      patient's medical charts at Johns Hopkins Hospital for the clinical information of the ED
      visit and subsequent HCV-related visits. In addition, the patient will be asked for
      permission to allow the investigators to use the remnant blood specimen of this study in the
      future for an evaluation of an in-house HCV RNA viral load assay. Consented patients will be
      randomized to one of two groups, HCV POC Testing Group or Standard of Care (SOC) Group. The
      testing group will receive the POC HCV viral load testing via fingerstick using a novel Xpert
      HCV Viral Load Finger-stick (Xpert HCV VL FS) point-of-care (POC) test and the reference
      group will not receive this POC VL testing. Both groups will receive stand of care
      conventional laboratory-based whole blood HCV VL testing. Consented patients in both groups
      will fill out a short survey regarding participant's socio-demographic information as well as
      participant's experience, attitudes, and perceptions regarding HCV testing and care
