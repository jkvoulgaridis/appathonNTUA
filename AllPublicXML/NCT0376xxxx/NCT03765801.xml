  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study in healthy women is to explore the intestinal uptake
      (bioavailability) of two different tablets of GRTA9906 (formulations) into the body and the
      effect of food on it. The intake of food may considerably influence the bioavailability,
      either by interaction with the compound itself or, if a prolonged release (PR) formulation is
      used, with the components of the tablet-matrix. For these reasons, the relative
      bioavailability and the effect of food on the bioavailability of GRTA9906 given as PR tablets
      compared to immediate release (IR) capsules will be assessed in this study.

      During the 4 periods of the study, each participant will receive two 60 mg GRTA9906 PR matrix
      tablets and two 60 mg GRTA9906 IR capsules under fed conditions (after consumption of a
      high-fat and high-calorie test meal) and fasting conditions (10 hours before dosing until 4.5
      hours after dosing). In each period, the participant will receive the investigational product
      once.

             contraception must be used for the duration of the study, defined as from the time of
             screening to the post-study medical examination, and for at least one full month
             thereafter. A single barrier method alone or abstinence alone is not acceptable. Women
             of non-childbearing potential may be included if surgically sterile or post-menopausal
             for at least 2 years).

          -  Must be able to tolerate high-fat and high-calorie study-meal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diseases and functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system,
             renal system or cardiovascular system including marked repolarisation abnormality
             (e.g. suspicious or definite congenital long QT syndrome) or co-medication that is
             known to influence cardiac repolarisation substantially.

          -  Malignancy.

          -  History of orthostatic hypotension.

          -  Positive human immunodeficiency virus HIV1/2-antibodies, hepatitis B surface-antigen
             (HBs), hepatitis B core-antibodies (HBc), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody tests at
             the prestudy medical examination.

          -  Drug allergy.

          -  Bronchial asthma.

          -  Participation in another clinical study in the last three months before starting this
             study (exception: characterisation of metaboliser status).

          -  Blood donation (more than 100 milliliter) in the last three months before the start of
             the study.

          -  Evidence of alcohol, medication or drug abuse.

          -  Positive drug abuse screening test.

          -  Extremely unbalanced diet (in the opinion of the investigator).

          -  Excessive consumption of food or beverages containing caffeine or other xanthines
             (more than five cups of coffee or equivalent per day).

          -  Smoking of more than 20 cigarettes per day.

          -  Known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol.

          -  Neurotic personality, psychiatric illness, or suicide risk.

          -  History of seizures or at risk (i.e. head trauma, epilepsy in family anamnesis,
             unclear loss of consciousness).

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.
