      The project will apply the methods of clinical observation experiment, (1) to collect the
      cognitive function data preoperatively and early postoperatively, as well as the pain score
      data at multiple time points pre- and postoperatively, and to observe the role of the degree
      of recovery of early postoperative cognitive function on acute pain and chronic pain after
      thoracic surgery. (2) to collect the resting-state electroencephalography (EEG)
      preoperatively, and to assess the role of EEG index system on the prediction of the degree of
      recovery of early postoperative cognitive function as well as the acute pain and chronic pain
      after thoracic surgery.

    <textblock>
      Patients after thoracic surgery are liable to suffer from moderate to severe acute pain and
      refractory chronic pain, which would lead to serious somatic and psychological suffering. Its
      successful treatment is a great challenge for pain physicians. To date, the mechanism of pain
      chronification after thoracic surgery remains unclear. Further, it is still lack of efficient
      preventive and therapeutic measures for this chronic pain. The project will apply the methods
      of clinical observation and animal experiment, (1) to collect the cognitive function data
      preoperatively and early postoperatively, as well as the pain score data at multiple time
      points pre- and postoperatively, and to observe the role of the degree of recovery of early
      postoperative cognitive function on acute pain and chronic pain after thoracic surgery. (2)
      to collect the resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) preoperatively, and to assess the
      role of EEG index system on the prediction of the degree of recovery of early postoperative
      cognitive function as well as the acute pain and chronic pain after thoracic surgery. The
      project will be able to determine the relationships between the degree of recovery of early
      postoperative cognitive function, as well as preoperative resting-state EEG indices and
      postoperative acute pain and chronic pain, and clarify the neural mechanism of acute pain and
      chronic pain after thoracic surgery. The expected outcomes of this study can contribute to
      early identification of the patients who are liable to develop into acute pain and chronic
      pain after thoracic surgery, and give them reasonable intervention in time, and provide
      effective solutions for the acute pain and chronic pain after thoracic surgery.
