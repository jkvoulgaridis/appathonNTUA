    <textblock>
      This feasibility study investigates the use of enhanced measurement-based care (eMBC) within
      routine medical treatment for patients with depression in an outpatient psychiatric setting.
      eMBC will be facilitated using an Internet-based application optimized for mobile devices,
      such as smartphones and tablets. The study investigates whether patients and their treating
      clinicians find technology-enabled eMBC to be acceptable and feasible, and whether clinical
      and functional outcomes improve with use of eMBC, compared to informational online resources
      for mental health.

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is increasingly recognized as the most common psychiatric
      disorder and as one of the most common medical diagnoses worldwide.

      This research study investigates the feasibility of using an Internet-based application that
      incorporates a technology-enhanced platform of measurement-based care (eMBC) in routine
      clinical care for MDD within an outpatient psychiatric setting.

      Measurement-based care (MBC) is an evidence-based approach for providing effective clinical
      care to patients with MDD. MBC utilizes validated rating scales to assess symptom severity,
      functional impairments, treatment adherence, and side-effect burden to personalize clinical
      decision-making based on measured outcomes and clinical algorithms. However, despite evidence
      demonstrating improved outcomes, MBC is still not routinely used by physicians. Barriers to
      the use of MBC include lack of knowledge of which scales to use, how to incorporate
      measurements into clinical charting systems, and the extra time needed for repeated
      assessments.

      Our research team developed a web-based application (app) optimized for mobile devices to
      address the treatment gap in MBC for people with depression, especially those who are working
      while depressed. This user-friendly app encourages patients to actively participate in MBC by
      using their smartphones, tablets, or computers to screen, monitor, and manage depressive
      symptoms and functional outcomes. Results can be easily displayed and printed to share with
      clinicians, thereby affording health professionals a simple and cost-effective means to
      integrate eMBC into standard practices and to optimize treatment for MDD at the point of
      care, without needing additional materials, equipment, or staffing.

      To determine both the clinical and practical utility of eMBC, this study will enroll
      &quot;real-world&quot; patients with few exclusion criteria and undergoing naturalistic treatments so
      that findings will be generalizable to other clinical settings and practices.
