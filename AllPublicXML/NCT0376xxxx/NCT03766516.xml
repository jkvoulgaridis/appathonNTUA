  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of relapsed or refractory ALK-negative ALCL patients, high-dosage chemotherapy/ stem
      cell transplantation is a universal salvage option for patients with sensitivity to
      anti-cancer treatment and a relatively successful salvage rate can be expected.

      Recently, there has been a report of successful stem cell transplantation with full response
      to BrentuximabVedotin induced before stem cell transplantation and BrentuximabVedotin's role
      as a bridge therapy before stem cell transplantation has also been suggested.

      Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of curable blood cancer with unique tissues and clinical
      characteristics. Based on the 2008 WHO classification, Hodgkin lymphoma has two types—nodular
      lymphocyte predominant type and classical type—and the classical type is further classified
      into four types, nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte depletion and
      lymphocyte-rich type.

      Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitor is reported as a very effective treatment for relapsed
      Hodgkin lymphoma and more active treatment such as stem cell transplantation is considered
      for younger patients.

      Treatment with Brentuximabvedotin targeting CD30+ is also very effective for the treatment of
      relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and considered a good option for patients who are not suitable for
      stem cell transplantation or aged patients.

      It shows consistent response to anti-CD30 antibody treatment in relation to relapsed
      anaplastic large cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma. The effect of Brentuximabvedotin (BV) has
      been proven for relapsed or intractable ALCL targeting CD30 as an antibody-chemical adhesive
      in the recent phase-2 study.

      As Korea currently lacks real-world evidence in relation to BV, this study was conducted to
      address BV's effect as salvage therapy for patients with relapsed/refractoryanaplastic large
      cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma. This study identified the clinical results for treatment
      patterns and patients using the collected data and derived critical evidence for treatment
      decisions.
