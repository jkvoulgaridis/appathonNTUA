      The aim of this study was to determine the muscle architecture of the lower extremity muscles
      (pennation angle, muscle fiber length and muscle thickness) in patients with multiple
      sclerosis. Lower extremity muscles of patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy
      individuals; rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, gastrosoleus and
      gastrocnemius muscles will be examined by ultrasound method.

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by complex and heterogeneous symptoms, often leading
      to reduced quality of life and impaired functional capacity. The latter is related to reduced
      muscle strength of predominately the lower limbs . The mechanisms underlying the observed
      strength deficits are of muscular as well as neural origin . At the whole muscle level, a
      number of studies have examined skeletal muscle characteristics of MS patients, with some
      studies but not all, reporting loss of muscle mass and decreased or comparable maximal muscle
      strength.

      However, there is no study describing the features of lower extremity muscle architecture in
      multiple sclerosis. Muscle architecture is defined as the alignment of muscle fibers with
      respect to the axis of force. Although the diameters of the muscles of different sizes are
      quite similar to the diameters of the fibers, the sequences of these fibers contain several
      differences. The alignment of the muscle forming fibers has a significant effect on the force
      of muscle formation. The parameters that determine muscle architecture characteristics are
      the muscle fiber length, pennation angle, the physiological cross-sectional area. For each
      muscle these parameters may differ from each other. Any type of load in the case is the
      result of an adaptation process that results in muscle development. Muscle architecture
      allows the macroscopic understanding and interpretation of this adaptation process.

      Determining the muscle architecture of multiple sclerosis patients by ultrasound will guide
      the rehabilitation process.
