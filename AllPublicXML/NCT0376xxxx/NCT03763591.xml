  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently 28 million child refugees worldwide - approximately 1 in every 200
      children on earth. To date, nearly one million forcibly displaced child migrants have been
      resettled in the United States. It is well documented that refugee and immigrant youth,
      especially forcibly displaced ethnic and cultural minority youth, present with alarmingly
      high rates of stress-related psychiatric illness (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety) and are
      grossly underserved by current mental health, medical, and social services. Previous research
      found that in a sample of 144 Somali refugee children resettled in the United States, only 8%
      of those who met full clinical criteria for PTSD received any mental health services. Through
      a process of community-based participatory research with refugee and immigrant communities
      and stake-holders the investigators have developed a multi-tiered psychological and systems
      intervention for refugee youth and families, Trauma Systems Therapy for Refugees (TST-R),
      that includes community outreach and advocacy, group psychological treatment, office-based
      psychotherapy, and home-based services.

      Whereas TST-R is one of the only empirically-based behavioral health treatment models for
      refugee youth, it has only been studied as a full intervention model; financial and staffing
      resource barriers have limited the wide-spread adoption of the model. This obstacle noted,
      implementing one high-impact component of this multi-tier intervention (i.e., protocol-driven
      group treatments) may provide significant benefit while also being easily scalable.
      Implementing time-limited (i.e., 10 week) manual-based group psychological interventions
      focused on culturally-responsive strategies to support refugee youth with, and at-risk for,
      PTSD, depression, and anxiety, may be an efficient and cost effective means of (1) reducing
      psychiatric symptoms for refugee and migrant youth with present symptoms, (2) preventing
      symptom onset for those at risk, and (3) enhancing cultural identity self-concept, subjective
      social belongingness, and psychological resilience (e.g., ability to thrive in the context of
      adversity). Furthermore, if effective, treatment groups can importantly function as a
      destigmatizing treatment gateway and triage to other services for youth who require a higher
      level of care (e.g., individual psychotherapy and medication management).
