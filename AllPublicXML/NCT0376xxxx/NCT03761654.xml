  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can cause transient myocardial dysfunction. Recently, it have
      been reported that myocardial dysfunctions that occur in SAH are associated with poor
      outcomes. It therefore appears essential to detect theses dysfunctions with the higher
      sensitivity as possible. Strain measurement using speckle-tracking echocardiography may
      detect myocardial dysfunction with great sensitivity. The main objective of this study is to
      assess the prevalence of myocardial dysfunction in &quot;non-severe&quot; SAH (defined by a WFNS grade
      1 or 2), using speckle-tracking echocardiography. This study also aims to analyse Strain
      measurement with classical echocardiography and serum markers (troponin, BNP) of cardiac
      dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac complication, occurring in the early phase of SAH has been well described. It seems
      that the pathophysiological mechanism involves vegetative hyperactivity due to the acute
      cerebral injury. It has been shown that stress cardiomyopathy is associated with delayed
      cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor outcomes. Manifestations of stress cardiomyopathy are
      changes in electrocardiogram, release of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and BNP, and
      echography evidence of impaired left ventricle ejection fraction with the use of Simpson
      technique and regional wall motion abnormalities. These two techniques bear intra-observer
      variability. A new method is available to assess left ventricular contractility at the
      bedside. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking images with echocardiography allows one to track a
      natural myocardial marker within the myocardium by standard transthoracic echocardiography.
      It provides unique insights into myocardial function such as tissue deformations and strain
      rate, which is the rate of deformation. This method is more sensitive than classical
      echographic left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation and bears very low interobserver
      variability. The Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) is the most studied parameter.

      Early detection of cardiac dysfunction in SAH followed by appropriate monitoring and
      management may improve outcome in SAH. This is a prospective, observational and mono-center
      study.

      Patients with &quot;non-severe&quot; SAH will benefit from an echocardiography where Left Ventricular
      Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and GLS will be assessed on day 1, 3 and 7 following the acute
      injury.

    <description>It is calculated using values of longitudinal strain measured in the three-,four-, and two-chamber of the left ventricle of the heart. GLS is expressed as percentage. Strain is a measure of myocardial muscle fiber shortening during contraction and is calculated as the systolic segment shortening between end-systolic (ES) segment length (L) and end-diastolic (ED) length: strain = (-LES - LED)/LED x 100 %.</description>
