  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CART cells in treating
      patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that have not respond to chemotherapy and
      autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). B-cell maturation antigen
      (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on mutiple maloma cells, has emerged as a very
      selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherpy for MM. Targeting postulated CD19
      positive myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells is a novel approach to MM therapy.

      This is multi-center, phase I trial that studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CART
      cells in treating patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that have not respond to
      chemotherapy and autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). B-cell
      maturation antigen (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on mutiple maloma cells , has
      emerged as a very selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherpy for MM. Targeting
      postulated CD19+ myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells is a novel approach to MM
      therapy.
