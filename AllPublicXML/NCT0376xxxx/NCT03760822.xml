  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate six months survival rate and quality of life at 4 months
      of ramucirumab alone or in combination with paclitaxel in patients aged 70 years or more who
      have stomach or GEJ adenocarcinoma and whose first line of fluoropyrimidine- and
      platinumcontaining treatment has failed.

      The co-primary endpoints are the following:

        -  Six months survival rate

        -  Quality of life at 4 months as assessed by the following three target dimensions of the
           EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire: mobility, illness burden and worries about the future
