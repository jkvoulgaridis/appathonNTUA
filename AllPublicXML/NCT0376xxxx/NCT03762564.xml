      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study including patients

      therapy with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, open-label multi-center study comparing treatment of
      paclitaxel plus ramucirumab with paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with advanced
      squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus.

      Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced squamous-cell
      carcinoma of the esophagus and refractory or intolerant to combination therapy with
      Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs will be enrolled in the study.

      A total number of 186 patients will be enrolled (Randomization 1:1). 93 patients will be
      treated with paclitaxel + ramucirumab (Arm A) and 93 with paclitaxel (Arm B).

      Randomization will be stratified by time of progression during or after end of first-line
      therapy (≤3 months vs. &gt;3 months).

      The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) after 6 months in patients with
      squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, refractory or intolerant to combination therapy
      with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs receiving paclitaxel with ramucirumab versus
      paclitaxel alone in the intent-to-treat population (ITT). OS is defined as the time from
      randomization to death from any cause.

      Patients in Arm A (investigational arm) receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 plus
      Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg i.v. infusion on day 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. Patients in Arm B (control
      arm) receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks. Study treatment will be
      continued until progression or intolerable toxicity, but for a maximum of 1 year.

      Tumor assessment will be performed according to clinical routine at screening / baseline and
      every 8 weeks.

      After discontinuation of study medication, patients will be followed for up to 1 year. Tumor
      assessments per CT or MRI will be performed every 2 months for 6 months or until
      documentation of disease progression. Follow-up for survival will be done and documented
      every 2 months for the 1 year follow-up period after end of treatment.

      During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, detection of toxicity) will be
      performed prior to every treatment dose. Safety of paclitaxel +/- ramucirumab will be
      monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse
      events (SAEs) reported. Prior to the start of each cycle and at the 30-day safety follow-up
      visit Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and
      treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30).

          1. Signed written informed consent;

          2. Male or female* ≥ 18 years of age; Patients in reproductive age must be willing to use
             adequate contraception during the study and for 6 months after the end of ramucirumab
             treatment (Appropriate contraception is defined as surgical sterilization (e.g.,
             bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomy), hormonal contraception (implantable, patch,
             oral), and double-barrier methods (any double combination of: IUD, male or female
             condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap)). Female patients with
             childbearing potential need to have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before
             study start.

             *There are no data that indicate special gender distribution. Therefore, patients will

          3. Histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus

               -  Adult patients with metastatic or locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the
                  esophagus, not amenable to potentially curative resection, who are refractory to
                  or intolerant of prior platinum/fluoropyrimidine combination therapy. The
                  definition of refractory should be defined as follows:

               -  Patients whose PD or recurrence was confirmed by imaging during their initial
                  chemotherapy (including chemoradiation) or within 8 weeks after the last dose of
                  chemotherapy will be assessed as &quot;refractory&quot;.

               -  Patients after radical resection in conjunction with chemotherapy, including
                  neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy and chemoradiation, whose recurrence was confirmed
                  by imaging within 24 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy, will be
                  determined &quot;refractory&quot;.

          4. Measurable or non-measurable but evaluable disease determined using guidelines in
             RECIST 1.1 as confirmed within 28 days before randomization

                  times the ULN, a 24-hour urine collection to calculate creatinine clearance must
                  be performed)

               -  Urinary protein ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine dipstick or
                  routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate

                  be switched to low molecular weight heparin and have an INR ≤3.0 prior to first
                  dose of protocol therapy. For heparin and LMWH there should be no active bleeding
                  (that is, no bleeding within 14 days prior to first dose of protocol therapy) or
                  pathological condition present that carries a high risk of bleeding (for example,
                  tumor involving major vessels or known varices).
