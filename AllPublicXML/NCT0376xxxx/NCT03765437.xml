    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety of the Quadrivalent Influenza
      Vaccine (QIV). Safety is assessed throughout the study period, and includes solicited
      injection site and systemic reactions (Day 0 to Day 7 post-vaccination); unsolicited adverse
      events up to Day 28, and serious adverse events occurring throughout the study.

      Study duration for previously unvaccinated participants aged 6 months to 8 years is
      approximately 56 days. Study duration for previously vaccinated participants aged 6 months to
      8 years and any participant aged 9 years and older is approximately 28 days.
