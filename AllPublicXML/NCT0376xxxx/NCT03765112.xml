      This study evaluates micro-vascular changes in patients with diabetes. Results of diseased
      retinas will be compared to healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide. Diabetic retinopathy is the
      most prevalent complication of DM and a leading cause of visual impairment due to closure of
      capillaries. High-resolution imaging techniques of the retina and its supplying vascular
      networks can allow novel insight to subtle changes that cannot be appreciated in standard
      fundus examination. In this study capillary changes of patients with different severity
      levels of diabetic retinopathy will be investigated with non-invasive imaging technology to
      better understand the process of disease progression.

      Imaging will be done with Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) angiography as well as spectral
      domain OCT and ultra wide-field imaging.
