  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Here we will investigate the effect of sulforaphane, provided as a broccoli sprout extract
      (BSE) on blood glucose in pre-diabetic individuals without metformin treatment. This will
      address whether BSE could be used to improve glucose control in drug-naïve pre-diabetic
      individuals. The participants will receive BSE or placebo in a randomized double-blind
      parallel arm study. The participants will take their study compound once daily over 12 weeks.
      The primary study variable is fasting glucose.

    <description>Sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprout extract (BSE). The study product is BSE with standardized amounts of sulforaphane. BSE contains a mixture of maltodextrin as a bulking agent and copper chlorophyllin (E 141) as a food additive. BSE is a dried powder of an aqueous extract of broccoli sprouts that provides a consistent and stable source of sulforaphane.</description>

    <description>A mixture of maltodextrin and copper chlorophyllin will be used as placebo. The active compound and the placebo are the same except BSE. The placebo will look similar to the BSE-containing mixture.</description>

    <intervention_type>Dietary Supplement</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>BSE</intervention_name>
    <description>BSE powder will be provided as dry mixtures in sealed, non-transparent portion size bags. Each BSE bag contains 150 μmole, equal to 0.26 g, sulforaphane at a minimum. The mixtures are suspended with appr. 1 dl water and are ingested once daily in the morning. BSE should be stored at room temperature in dry conditions.
The doses of sulforaphane contained in the BSE is not possible to get by eating fresh broccoli, thus it has to be given as an extract.</description>
