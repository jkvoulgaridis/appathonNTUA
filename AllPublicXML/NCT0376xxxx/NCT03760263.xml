      1. Background and Rationale- The novel once-daily extended-release tacrolimus (ERT) has
           been shown to be non-inferior to twice-daily tacrolimus (TDT) during induction
           immunotherapy for kidney transplantation. The ERT (Envarsus) has a MeltDose technology
           that allows for steadier absorption of tacrolimus throughout the entire gastrointestinal
           tract. This drug has decreased peak to trough fluctuation. This decrease in variability
           and stabilized trough level should allow for easier achievement of target drug levels
           with fewer clinic visits and drug level assays.

        2. Objective

             1. To assess the safety of ERT versus TDT and effectiveness in achieving tacrolimus
                trough therapeutic range during the first 6 months after transplantation

             2. Primary End-Point

           i. Ability to achieve center specific target tacrolimus trough levels at the determined
           intervals after transplantation.

      1. Percent of levels in range 2. As most levels occur in the first 6 months, a 6-month time
      frame will be used for the primary analysis.

      c. Secondary End-Points i. Number of dose adjustments required ii. Time in therapeutic range
      for tacrolimus trough levels during intervals after transplantation based on the Rosendaal
      Method

        1. Time within goal for each time period

        2. Time within larger goal of 6-11 iii. Number of lab draws required to achieve trough
           tacrolimus levels iv. Time to get in therapeutic range v. Cost associated with
           maintaining therapeutic troughs of tacrolimus

        3. Subject Selection a. Subjects will be selected from patients scheduled to receive a
           living donor or deceased donor kidney transplants at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital b.
           Inclusion Criteria i. Age 18-70 ii. Receiving a kidney transplant at Sentara Norfolk
           General Hospital iii. Able to give informed consent c. Exclusion Criteria i. Multi-organ
           transplant ii. Previous functioning transplant iii. Prior surgery to the
           gastrointestinal tract that alters the normal anatomy with the exception of
           cholecystectomy iv. Women of childbearing potential who cannot or are unwilling to
           maintain adequate contraception during the course of this study.

           d. Patients will be offered enrollment in the study prior to transplant and Informed
           Consent will be obtained.

           e. Patients will be randomized to standard twice-daily tacrolimus (Prograf) or
           once-daily extended-release tacrolimus (Envarsus) at a ratio of 1:2.

        4. Methods a. Informed Consent to participate in this study will be obtained prior to
           transplant.

           b. Study subjects will receive usual care induction immunosuppression with
           Anti-thymocyte globulin or basiliximab, steroids and mycophenolate per the center's
           protocol.

           c. Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized and started on tacrolimus within 72
           hours after transplant.

           i. Randomization

        1. Prior to study initiation, numbered packets will be created including randomized group
           and the Informed Consent Form.

        2. The packets will be used in order.

        3. The group will be determined using the random number generator using values from 1-99
           where a value of 1-66 will have an ERT assignment in the study packet and a value of
           67-99 will have a TDT assignment in the study packet.

           ii. Subjects randomized to the study group will start ERT at 8mg (or 4mg if concern for
           delayed graft function) as a single daily dose.

           iii. Subjects randomized to the control group will start TDT at 8mg (or 4mg if concern
           for delayed graft function) divided in half for a dose every 12 hours.

           iv. If a subject weighs less than or equal to 55kg, then the subject will receive a
           reduced dose of either ERT or TDT at the provider's discretion.

           d. Subjects' tacrolimus levels in the study will follow our regular post-transplant
           care. This center uses an outpatient nursing protocol for most patients. If a patient is
           excluded from the nursing protocol, their tacrolimus levels will be managed individually
           and changes will be made at the nephrologist's discretion.

           i. Prograf protocol (appendix A) ii. Envarsus protocol (appendix B) e. All other care is
           routine (nothing done solely for the purpose of research). Other routine care includes:
           i. Weekly clinic visits and labs for the first month, every other week for the second
           month then a minimum of monthly through 6 months post transplant.

           ii. During those visits, labs will be drawn, including a tacrolimus level, regardless of
           study arm. Subjects will receive our routine nephrologist and nurse visits while in
           clinic. Other specialists (surgeon, dietician, pharmacist, diabetes educator) will see
           the subjects, as needed.

           iii. Dose changes will either be made in clinic or with a phone call to the subject
           after clinic, if necessary. Tacrolimus dose changes will be directed by our nurse
           protocols (appendix A and B). If the subject is excluded from the nursing protocol, the
           level and dose will be managed by the nephrologist.

      5. Investigator Responsibilities- The principal investigator will be responsible to ensure
      that:

        1. all IRB required training for staff and investigators is completed,

        2. all staff and investigators comply with the institution's patient and subject safety
           requirements,

        3. the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol and

        4. data collection requirements are maintained. 6. Data Analysis

      a. Continuous variables will be analyzed using student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U, where
      appropriate.

      b. Categorical variables will be analyzed using the chi2 test or Fischer's Exact test where
      appropriate.

      c. Power analysis for the primary endpoint which will evaluate each level and whether it is
      in range or not i. Alpha =0.05, beta =0.8 ii. Prior data shows 41% of levels in range for
      TDT. We predict that ERT dosing will have 53% of levels in range.

      iii. With a ratio of 2:1, the minimum will need 406 ERT levels (~38 patients) and 203 TDT
      levels (~19 patients).

      iv. The number of patients is based on patients having 11 levels in the first 6 months, the
      minimum number of based on our protocol.

      7. Data collected includes : i. Inclusion/Exclusion

      1. If excluded, reason for exclusion ii. Randomization to Prograf or Envarsus iii.

        8. Living or deceased donor iv. Transplant outcomes

      1. Rejection (Yes/No and if yes, time interval post-transplant in days). Defined as requiring
      steroids, thymoglobulin, and/or IVIG 2. BK viremia (Yes/No and if yes, time interval
      post-transplant in days) 3. CMV viremia (Yes/No and if yes, time interval post-transplant in
      days) v. Tacrolimus level with time interval post-transplant in days (Yes/No/Not timed
      correctly) vi. Tacrolimus dose 8. HIPPA Concerns

        1. This study will collect data on patient demographics, treatments and outcomes of
           treatments. Patient data collected will be de-identified of Protected Health Information
           (PHI) and will not alter patient treatment. This study is designed to address fully
           HIPAA's requirements for health data that are collected with patient consent.

        2. Study data may be made available to third parties, e.g., in the case of an audit
           performed by regulatory authorities, provided the data are treated confidentially and
           that the subject's privacy is guaranteed.

        3. Subjects identities will not be identifiable or disclosed if results from the study are
           published.

           9. Data handling

      a. The key to patient coding for identification (see Appendix C) and data collection forms
      will be kept on a password protected computer in a locked office which is only accessible by
      the investigators and research assistants. To maintain compliance with IRB requirements, the
      study data will be maintained for the required period of three years. Once the study is
      completed and data is retained for a minimum of 3 years per the requirements of the IRB, the
      identifiable data will be destroyed .

      10. Human Subjects

        1. Due to the nature of the study, there is a potential risk in regards to breach of
           patient confidentiality. This will be reduced with the collection of the patient's MRN
           as the identifier, which will then be given a code (see Appendix C), and the storage of
           this data on a password protected computer in a locked office. The records will be
           secured for three years according to Federal regulation.

        2. Risks

      i. There are risks with blood draws that are bruising, swelling at site, and, in rare cases,
      nerve damage.

      ii. Both formulations of tacrolimus (ERT and TDT) are approved for this indication,
      prevention of rejection after kidney transplant. Expected adverse events have been identified
      from approval studies. Any serious adverse events will be reported to Veloxis's safety
      partner, UBC. The study team has the forms to fill out. Any adverse events that require FDA
      notification will be reported to MedWatch.

      c. Benefits i. Subjects who are randomized to receive ERT will receive 6 months-worth of
      study drug provided by the drug company. After 6 months, the subject's insurance company will
      be billed for the drug and patients may be responsible for a copayment.

      ii. Subjects will not have to pay to participate in the study. iii. Subjects will not be paid
      to participate in the study. 11. Request for Support

      a. The PI requests a 6-month supply of ERT for each subject randomized to the study group.

      b. A request for funding for direct study activities will be requested when the research
      center and the sponsor have agreed to the study protocol.
