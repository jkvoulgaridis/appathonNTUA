  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, first in human (FIH) study consisting of the following parts: Part 1a
      (SAD), Part 1b (IV Cohort), Part 2 (Multiple ascending dose (MAD)/ Proof of mechanism (PoM)),
      and Part 3 (Bridging). Part 1a of the study will be a randomized, single-blind,
      placebo-controlled, SAD, sequential group design study performed at a single study center.
      Part 1b, will be an open-label, single-dose, single-cohort study. It will follow a 2-stage
      design in the way that participants from Part 1a will be selected for the IV Cohort in Part
      1b. Part 2 of the study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD,
      sequential group design and PoM study performed at 2 study centers. Part 3 will be a
      randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-cohort bridging study performed at a
      single study center. The expected duration of each subject in Part 1a of the study is up to
      36 days and up to 53 days for subjects participating in Part 1b. The expected duration of
      each patient in Part 2 and Part 3 of the study is up to 48 days.

      Part 1a of the study with six inhaled dose levels of AZD0449 nebulized suspension are planned
      to be investigated in 6 cohorts. Depending on emerging safety and PK data, up to 3 additional
      inhaled dose levels (cohorts), within the pre-specified dose range may be added at the
      discretion of the Sponsor. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive an
      inhaled dose of AZD0449 nebulized suspension and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive
      inhaled placebo. Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will start with 2 subjects in a
      sentinel cohort, such that 1 subject will be randomized to receive AZD0449 nebulized
      suspension and 1 subject will be randomized to receive placebo. In each cohort, participants
      will attend a screening visit within 28 days before receiving the dose of AZD0449 nebulized
      suspension or corresponding placebo. For the treatment period, participants will be admitted
      to the clinical unit on Day -1. On Day 1, participants will receive a single inhaled dose of
      AZD0449 nebulized suspension or corresponding placebo. Assessments will be performed, and
      samples collected from before dosing until at least 60 hours post-dose. Participants will be
      discharged from the clinical unit after all samples have been collected and assessments have
      been performed on Day 4. Dosing in Part 1b of the study will only be initiated after the
      completion of Cohort 6 in Part 1a (SAD), or, if Part 1a is completed with less than 6
      cohorts, after completion of the last cohort in Part 1a. The IV Cohort will consist of the 6
      participants that received an inhaled dose of AZD0449 nebulized suspension in Part 1a of the
      study. Within the IV Cohort, all 6 participants will receive a single IV dose of AZD0449
      solution. Dosing will start with 1 participant in a sentinel cohort. There will be a washout
      period of at least 2 weeks for the participants receiving both inhaled dosing in Part 1a and
      IV dosing in Part 1b. For the IV treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical
      unit on Day -1. On Day 1, participants will receive a single IV dose of the AZD0449 solution.
      Assessments will be performed, and samples collected from before dosing until at least 36
      hours post-dose. In Part 2 (MAD/PoM) of the study, three dose levels of AZD0449 nebulized
      suspension are planned to be investigated in 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 and 2 will comprise of 9
      participants and within each of these cohorts 6 participants will be randomized to receive
      AZD0449 nebulized suspension and 3 participants randomized to receive placebo. Cohort 3 will
      be larger than the other cohorts (30 patients). In Cohort 3, 18 participants will be
      randomized to receive AZD0449 nebulized suspension and 12 participants randomized to receive
      placebo. Data from participants receiving placebo in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (3 participants
      per cohort) will be added to data from the 12 placebo participants in Cohort 3. Dosing for
      each ascending dose cohort will start with 2 participants in a sentinel cohort, such that 1
      participant will be randomized to receive AZD0449 nebulized suspension and 1 participant will
      be randomized to placebo. For the treatment period, participants will be admitted to the
      clinical unit on Day -2. The first dose will be administered on Day 1. Following this first
      dose, plasma PK samples will be collected over a period long enough to allow for
      characterization of the late elimination phase, dosing will only be continued thereafter.
      Part 3 of the study will only be initiated after the completion of Part 2 (MAD/PoM) of the
      study. A cohort of the same size and at the same dose level as the PoM cohort in Part 2 will
      participate in Part 3 of the study. The cohort will comprise of 24 participants, 18 patients
      will be randomized to receive AZD0449 DPI and 6 participants randomized to receive placebo.
