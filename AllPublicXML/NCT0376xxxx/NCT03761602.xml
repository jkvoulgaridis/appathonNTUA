  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and ninety pregnant women with gestational age less than 20 weeks will be
      recruited in this study. Selenium and iodine conditions, and risk of thyroid disease will be
      monitored until termination of pregnancy, with pregnancy outcomes recorded.

    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 290 pregnant women with gestational age less than 20 weeks. Iodine and
      selenium condition will be evaluated through dietary recall (on base of Chinese food
      ingredient information) and biochemical examinations (serum iodine concentrations, urinary
      iodine concentrations, serum selenium concentrations, etc). The nutritional status of iodine
      and selenium will be monitored and followed up for all the included subjects throughout the
      pregnancy. The information of thyroid function and level of anti-TPO and anti-TG will be
      collected. And all the complications (especially thyroid disease) in pregnancy will also be
      recorded. All pregnant women will be followed up until the termination of pregnancy, with
      pregnancy outcomes recorded.

    <description>The subjects should have proper dietary intake of selenium and iodine, according to Chinese Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) (intake of selenium 65μg/d and iodine 230 μg/d).
The Serum iodine concentration are 45-92μg/L，and the urinary I/Cr 150-249μg/g Cr.
The Serum selenium concentrations are 18-40μg/L.</description>

    <description>The subjects have excessive dietary intake of selenium and iodine, usually more than 2 times of DRIs. The Serum iodine concentration are more than 100μg/L，and the urinary I/Cr more than 300μg/g Cr.
The Serum selenium concentrations are more than 40μg/L.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Insufficient selenium or iodine condition</arm_group_label>
    <description>The subjects have insufficient dietary intake of either selenium or iodine, compared with DRIs. The Serum iodine concentration are less than 45μg/L，and the urinary I/Cr less than150μg/g Cr.
The Serum selenium concentrations are less than 18μg/L.</description>
