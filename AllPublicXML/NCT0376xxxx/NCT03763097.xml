  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transperineal ultrasonography is gaining importance in preoperative and postoperative
      evaluation of the patient with urinary incontinence with allowing well detailed information
      about the anterior compartment.

      There is little evidence that transperineal sonography can aid surgeons to predict the
      success or failure after mid-urethral slings.

      We aimed to investigate the efficacy of sonography in mini-sling operations to predict the
      success or failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who are scheduled for anti-incontinence operation due to their stress urinary
      incontinence will be pre- and postoperatively evaluated by transperineal and introital
      ultrasound.

      Patients will be followed for at least 1 year.

    <measure>The correlation of failure with the sonographic features of the mesh</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation at postoperative 1st and 4th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be accepted as failure if their stress test is positive Sonographic features of the mesh includes the shape of the mesh, the distance to the mid-urethra, the position related to the proximal urethra and the angle between the mesh arms on coronal axis</description>

    <measure>Nocturia</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation at postoperative 1st and 4th weeks and preoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The nocturia episodes will be evaluated by a &quot;non-validated&quot; Likert scale (between 0-3). Minimum and minimum scores are between 0 and 3. &quot;0&quot; will mean no episode of urinating during the sleep. &quot;1&quot; will mean one episode of nocturia. &quot;2&quot; will mean two episodes of nocturia. &quot;3&quot; will mean three or more episodes of nocturia. Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Urge symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation at postoperative 1st and 4th weeks and preoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Michigan Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI) scale will be used to assess subjective outcome including urge symptoms. This scale has ten items, consisting of a total M-ISI domain (the sum of items 1-8) and a distinct Bother domain (the sum of items 9 and 10). The total M-ISI score consists of three subdomains (items 1-3 for stress urinary incontinence [SUI], items 4-6 for urge urinary incontinence [UUI], and items 7 and 8 for Pad usage [PU]. The responses for each item range from 0 to 4 on a Likert-type scale, with higher values representing greater symptoms and greater bother. Total domain and subdomain scores are obtained by simply adding the respective answers. The minimally important difference has been determined for the following domains/subdomains: total M-ISI (4 points), SUI (2 points), UUI (2 points), and PU (1 point).</description>
