  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimodal prehabilitation consists of a short-term (~ four to six weeks) preventive
      intervention to: i) enhance aerobic capacity and daily physical activity; ii) nutritional
      optimization; and, iii) psychological support before a major surgical procedure. The final
      aim of prehabilitation is to decrease surgical complications and speed-up postoperative
      functional recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a preventive intervention addressed to high risk candidates for major surgical
      procedures carried out for a period of approximately four weeks before surgery aiming at
      reducing complications and enhancing post-surgical recovery. It combines: i) high-intensity
      endurance exercise training and promotion of daily physical activity; ii) nutritional
      balance; and, iii) psychological support.

      The intervention is currently deployed as mainstream service at Hospital Clinic in several
      types of major surgeries. During fall 2017, three multidisciplinary workshops using a
      design-thinking approach were carried out to refine the service workflow and to explore the
      potential for service scalability. The outcomes of the co-design process provided a robust
      background for the design of a future personalized perioperative care service at regional
      level covering three phases: prehabilitation, in-patient care, and, post-discharge care.

      The current study protocol aims to assess cost-effectiveness of prehabilitation as mainstream
      service in the ongoing deployment at Hospital Clinic, as well as to generate a roadmap for
      regional scalability of the service. It is planned as a quasi-experimental case-control study
      including 500 patients undertaking prehabilitation, as intervention group, and 250 patients
      following standard conventional care before surgery. The patients will be included from the
      following type of surgeries (2:1 intervention to control ratio): major digestive surgery (n,
      525), lung volume reduction (n, 30), radical cystectomy (n, 30), major cardiovascular surgery
      (n, 165). Study groups will be made comparable using propensity score matching with the
      following matching variables: type of surgery, age, sex and adjusted morbidity groups (GMA)
      scoring.
