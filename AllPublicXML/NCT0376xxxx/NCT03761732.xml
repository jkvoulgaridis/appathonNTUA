  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the initial feasibility of a program called Islamic Trauma Healing by
      conducting a small feasibility study (N = 20) of Islamic Trauma Healing in Somalia on key
      targets of PTSD, depression, somatic symptoms, and quality of life. The hypothesis is that
      those in Islamic Trauma Healing will show a reduction of PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms,
      and somatic symptoms and show improvement in quality of well-being. Feasibility will also be
      examined by examining at retention, satisfaction, and community feedback.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Islamic Trauma Healing is a lay-led, small-group intervention specifically targeting healing
      mental wounds of trauma within mosques. The six-session intervention combines empirically
      supported exposure-based and cognitive restructuring techniques with Islamic principles. A
      lay-led, group program promotes community building, acknowledges trauma's impact in the
      community, and facilitates wider implementation. The program is not referred to as &quot;therapy&quot;
      or &quot;treatment&quot; for &quot;mental illness.&quot; It incorporates community building (e.g., shared tea,
      supplication), integrated Islamic principles that utilize cognitive restructuring through
      discussion of prophet narratives (e.g., faith during hard times, Prophet Job [Ayyub]), and
      exposure therapy through individual prayer, talking to Allah about the trauma. Ultimately,
      the program will follow a self-sustaining train-the-trainer model, led by group leaders,
      empowering lay leaders to facilitate healing in their communities. Further, training time is
      dramatically reduced to two, 4-hour training sessions, focusing on teaching skills of group
      discussion leading rather than training as a lay therapist or mental health counselor.
      Preliminary data from a community sample and from initial men's and women's groups show a
      strong perceived need and match with the Islamic faith, with large effects obtained for pre-
      to post-group across measures (g = 0.76-3.22). Qualitative analysis identified the
      intervention as operating on potential mechanisms of connectedness to the community, faith
      integration, healing, and growth. The preliminary data point to the program being
      well-received and offering a promising model for delivery of a trauma-focused intervention to
      Muslim communities. The next steps are examining Islamic Trauma Healing in low and
      moderate-income Muslim countries, examining the feasibility of implementing this lay-led
      program.
