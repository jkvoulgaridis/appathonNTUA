    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the safety and efficacy of Filtek Bulk Fill in Class I and II
      restorations at 1 week and 1 year postoperative; 3 hospitals in China participated and 240
      subjects will be enrolled, half of subjects will receive Filtek bulk full posterior
      restoration and the other half will receive Z350XT as control.

      This is a randomized, two- arm, non-inferiority study to evaluate the safety and clinical
      performance of resin composite. 240 qualified subjects will be enrolled. Filtek™ Z350XT
      Universal Restorative (Z350 XT) will serve as the control in this study. The subjects will be
      assigned to either the investigational product (Filtek Bulk ) or the control product (Z350XT)
      per web-based randomization system by statisticians for class I or II restoration.

      Immediately after restoration placement, at 1 week and 1 year postoperative, two evaluators
      from each site will perform an independent clinical assessment. The clinical acceptable rate
      of the restoration at 1 year is the primary endpoint in this study. Two or three clinical
      evaluators from each site will perform the clinical assessment (the third more senior
      evaluator will perform the assessment and determination if the first two evaluators are not
      in agreement) per China Technical Instruction and Guidance of Resin Composite Restoration
      Material For CFDA Registration (Technical Instruction and Guidance in short) (please refer to
      Table 1). AE/SAE will be collected to evaluate the safety of Filtek Bulk. Based on the
      assessment result, if the clinical acceptance rate of the two groups achieves the clinical
      acceptable rate defined in the protocol, it indicates that Filtek™ Bulk is efficacious for
      class 1 and II restorations.
