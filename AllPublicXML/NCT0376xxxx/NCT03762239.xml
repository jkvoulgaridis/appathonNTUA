  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous observational studies have reported an association between higher air pollution
      exposure and lower attention in children. With this project, the investigators aim to confirm
      this association in adolescents using an experimental design. In addition, the study will
      assess the relationship between air pollution exposure and individual preferences with
      respect to risk, time and social considerations. High school students in 3rd grade (ESO,
      14-15 years of age) in different high schools in the Barcelona province (Spain) will be
      invited to participate. For each class in each high school, participating students will be
      randomly split into two equal-sized groups. Each group will be assigned to a different
      classroom where they will complete several activities during two hours, including an
      attention test (Flanker task) and a reduced version of the Global Preferences Survey. One of
      the classrooms will have an air purifier that will clean the air. The other classroom will
      have the same device but without the filters, so it will only re-circulate the air without
      cleaning it. Students will be masked to intervention allocation. The investigators
      hypothesize that students assigned to the clean air classroom will have better scores in the
      attention test, and that decision-making will also present differences in the two classrooms.
