  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to explore the safety and performance of the Genio™ system in
      adult obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients with and without complete concentric collapse
      of the soft palate over a period of 4.5 months of treatment (i.e. 6 months post-surgery)
      measured by the AHI, at rest to determine if there is a difference in performance between the
      two populations.

      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric, 2 groups study to assess the safety and
      performance of the Genio™ system in adult obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients with and
      without complete concentric collapse of the soft palate. Participants will be consented,
      enrolled and eligibility criteria checked. If the participant is eligible, participant will
      proceed with the Genio™ IS implantation. Six (6) weeks after implantation, the implant will
      be activated and study visits will be scheduled at Week 7, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5
      and Month 6.

    <measure>Therapy response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as a reduction in AHI from baseline to 6 months of 50% or higher and apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) at 6 months less than 20.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 6 months post implantation in daytime sleepiness measured with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought. A reduction in ESS is considered a better outcome with a decrease of 2 points considered to be clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>Sleep-related quality of life, measured by functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire assesses the impact of excessive sleepiness on functional outcomes relevant to daily behaviors and sleep-related quality of life. It uses a 4-point Likert response format (1= extreme difficulty to 4=no difficulty) for 5 subscales: 1) activity level (3 items), 2) vigilance(3 items), 3) intimacy and sexual relationships (1 item), 4) general productivity (2 items), and 5) social outcomes (1 item). A total score is calculated and an increase is considered an improvement.</description>
