  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narcolepsy is a chronic, disabling, and rare sleep disorder (prevalence 1/2500) characterized
      by excessive daytime sleepiness and, in some patients, falls in muscle tone related to
      emotions (cataplexies). It often begins in childhood or in young adults. Symptoms of
      narcolepsy are responsible for an important handicap in everyday life, and are often
      misunderstood by the family and professional environment. In addition, many comorbidities are
      associated with narcolepsy, such as depression, anxiety, or obesity.

      Few studies have investigated the impact of narcolepsy on patients' academic background,
      socio-professional integration, and quality of life.

      Narcoleptic patients may experience more difficulties in their academic and professional path
      than non-narcoleptic people. These difficulties would be multifactorial (related to the
      disease itself, comorbidities, external factors ...).

      As a better understanding of these determinants could help to inform patients and guide them
      in their choices, this study propose to establish a comprehensive inventory of educational
      and professional trajectories of narcoleptic patients in France in order assess the
      specificity of the difficulties encountered by the people concerned in their life course and
      to appreciate the attitude of the academic and professional circle with respect to the
      disease.

      This category 3 study (according to the French law &quot;Loi Jardé&quot;) is based on the case-control
      model and will be conducted in all National Reference and Competence Centers for Narcolepsy
      and Hypersomnia. It will include a population of adult and paediatric patients. It will
      answer questions about work and schooling in these patients.

        This study will focus on pediatric and adult patients with type 1 narcolepsy and followed
        up in one of the participating rare disease reference or competence centers.

        Two control banks will be constituted:

          1. an &quot;adult control&quot; bank whose age is greater than 18 years: may be composed of the
             parents of included narcoleptic children or cousins and friends of included adult
             narcoleptic patients

          2. a bank &quot; child control' whose age is less than 18 years: may be composed of friends
             and cousins of included narcoleptic children.
