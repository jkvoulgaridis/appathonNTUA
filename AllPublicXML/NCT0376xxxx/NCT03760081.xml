  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP1650
      (Safety Lead-in Phase), as well as, evaluate the efficacy of ASP1650 as measured by confirmed
      objective response rate (ORR) (phase 2) in participants with incurable platinum refractory
      germ cell tumors.

      This study will also evaluate the following efficacy measures for confirmed objective
      response rate (ORR); clinical benefit rate (CBR); duration of response (DOR); and
      progression-free survival (PFS); as well as safety and tolerability; the effect of ASP1650 on
      changes in serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); and
      the pharmacokinetics of ASP1650.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 phases: Safety Lead-in phase and phase 2. The Safety Lead-in phase of
      this study is to establish the tolerability of RP2D. Nine to 18 participants will be enrolled
      in the Safety Lead-in phase. The RP2D determination will be based on at least 6 evaluable
      participants at the RP2D as determined by the Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC).

      Once RP2D has been established as tolerable, up to 34 participants including participants
      from the RP2D cohort of the Safety Lead-in phase will be enrolled in phase 2 to receive
      ASP1650 for up to a maximum of 12 cycles or until a study discontinuation criteria has been
      met, whichever occurs earlier.

    <description>The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be assessed through dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment by the Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC).

    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by nature, frequency, and severity of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug, and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
