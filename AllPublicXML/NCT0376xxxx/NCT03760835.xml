  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, open study designed to compare the effects of dual-release
      hydrocortisone preparations versus conventional glucocorticoid therapy on clinical,
      anthropometric parameters, metabolic syndrome, hormonal profile, bone status, quality of
      life, reproductive, sexual and psychological functions and treatment compliance in patients
      affected by congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 OH deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive
      disorder characterized by cortisol and in some cases aldosterone deficiency, associated with
      androgen excess. Treatment goals are to replace cortisol deficiency, to control androgen
      levels, while avoiding the adverse effects of exogenous glucocorticoids. A variety of
      glucocorticoid treatments have been used in an attempt to control the overnight increase in
      adrenal androgens. However, there is no consensus on the optimum management of congenital
      adrenal hyperplasia adults. Current evidence in patients with adrenal insufficiency suggests
      that the inability of current regimens to replace physiological circadian cortisol levels,
      leads to adverse clinical outcomes, including metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance,
      increased risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, bone and immune alterations, sleep
      disturbances and quality of life impairment. Moreover, the risk for poor treatment
      compliance, in case of multiple daily doses treatment regimens, should not be excluded. In
      this trial a dual-release hydrocortisone preparation, that been able to mimic the circadian
      pattern of circulating cortisol, was studied in patients with adrenal insufficiency due to
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

      All patients with a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase
      deficiency, irrespective of glucocorticoid treatment, are eligible for the inclusion in the
      study and may be asked to participate in the study. Patients are followed during the course
      of routine clinical practice for the duration of time that the study is active.

      ARM1: Conventional glucocorticoid therapy is continued as before entering the study

      ARM2: Dual release hydrocortisone oral tablets is administered once-daily in the fasting
      state. The dose is kept the same as patients had before entering the trial.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured by Addison Quality of Life (AddiQol) questionnaire, used to assess quality of life in patients suffering from adrenal insufficiency. Each question has a score ranging from 1 to 4. Total score (minimum: 30; maximum: 120) is obtained summing each question score. The higher the scores are, the better the quality of life is. No clear cut-offs are defined.</description>

IIEF is divided into five function domains: Erectile function (Q1-5, Q15; score range Q1-5: 0-5; score range Q15: 1-5), Orgasmic function (Q9-10; score range Q9: 0-5; score range Q10: 1-5), Sexual desire (Q11-12; score range: 1-5), Intercourse satisfaction (Q6-8; score range: 0-5), Overall satisfaction (Q13-14; score range: 1-5). The higher the domain scores are, the better the male sexual functions are.</description>

    <time_frame>0, + 6 months, + 12 months, +24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sex function will be measured by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. FSFI is divided into six domains: Desire (Q1-2; score range: 1-5), Arousal (Q3-6; score range: 0-5), Lubrification (Q7-10; score range: 0-5), Orgasm (Q11-13; score range: 0-5), Satisfaction (Q14-16; score range Q14: 0-5; score range Q15-16: 1-5), Pain (Q17-19; score range: 0-5). To obtain the full scale score (ranging from 2 to 36), each domain score range should be corrected by an individual factor (Desire: 0.6; Arousal and Lubrification: 0.3; Orgasm, Satisfaction and Pain: 0.4). The higher the score is, the better the female sexual function is.</description>
