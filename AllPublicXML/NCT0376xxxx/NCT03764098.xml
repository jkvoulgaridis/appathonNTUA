  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this protocol, the investigators plan to collect pilot data to examine sex differences in
      guanfacine's effect on 1) counteracting stress and stimulation based drinking behavior in the
      laboratory and 2) improving clinical outcomes during a subsequent treatment phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, which will
      compare guanfacine (6mg/day ER) to placebo (0mg/day) in treatment seeking adults meeting
      criteria for DSM V alcohol use disorders (32, 8 per med x sex cell).

      Eligibility screening consists of an intake session and a physical exam. Subjects meeting
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to 6mg/day ER guanfacine or matching placebo,
      stratified by sex. Titration to steady state medication levels will occur over a 3 week
      period (Weeks minus 3 to minus 1). Subjects will then complete three laboratory sessions
      during Week 0 to evaluate ad lib consumption.

      During each laboratory session, personalized imagery (within subject factor, stress,
      stimulating, or neutral/relaxing, order balanced) will precede a 2 hour alcohol
      self-administration period. Subjects will then begin a 6 week treatment phase (Week 1 to 6)
      where medication is combined with a medical management platform delivered at weekly
      appointments.

      At the end of the treatment phase, medication will be tapered for 5 days, and a final follow
      up evaluation will occur 1 and 3 months following the end of treatment. Primary outcome
      measures include the number of drinks consumed during the three self-administration sessions,
      and reduction in percent heavy days of drinking during treatment.

      Adverse events are evaluated at each study appointment and will be tabulated.
