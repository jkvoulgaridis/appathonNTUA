  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness among
      working-aged adults globally. In its early stages, DR is symptomless, and can only be
      detected by an annual eye exam. Once the disease has progressed to the point where vision
      loss has occurred, the damage is irreversible. Consequently, early detection is
      quintessential in treating DR. Two barriers to early detection are poor patient compliance
      with the annual exam and lack of access to specialists in rural areas. This research is
      focused on developing and validating new, cost-effective predictive technologies that can
      improve early screening of DR. Our overall objective is to develop and implement an entire
      suite of tools to detect diabetes complications in order to augment care for underserved
      rural populations in the US and internationally.
