  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of animal-assisted interactions (AAI) on stress,
      anxiety, and quality of life in children with a life-threatening condition and their parents.
      It is anticipated to be a milestone in understanding the human-animal bond.

      Objectives:

        1. Examine the feasibility of animal-assisted interactions sessions for children with a
           life-threatening condition and primary caregiver to:

             -  Identify and document modifications for a safe and feasible intervention,

             -  Obtain recruitment estimates and determine potential recruitment barriers

             -  Evaluate elements of implementation fidelity (design, training, delivery/receipt of
                Treatment, enactment)

             -  Verify safety.

           H1-1: Children and parents (&gt;60%) will complete the interventions and provide positive
           acceptability data. H1-2: Implementation fidelity can be achieved with the proposed
           methodology

        2. Determine the preliminary efficacy of animal-assisted interactions sessions for:

             -  Children with a life-threatening condition (LTC) for the outcome of health-related
                quality of life

             -  Children with a LTC and their primary caregivers for the outcomes of stress and
                anxiety

      H2-1 Children with a life-threatening condition who receive animal-assisted interactions will
      experience improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) more than patients who do not
      receive animal-assisted interactions.

      H2-2a Children with life-threatening condition who receive animal-assisted interactions will
      experience decreased stress and anxiety more than parents of children who do not receive
      animal-assisted interactions.

      H2-2b Primary caregivers of children with a life-threatening condition who receive
      animal-assisted interactions will experience decreased stress and anxiety more than parents
      of children who do not receive animal-assisted interactions.
