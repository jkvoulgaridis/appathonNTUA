  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the study drug LY900014 to insulin lispro (Humalog)
      when both are delivered by the Medtronic MiniMed 670G System in adults with type 1 diabetes
      (T1D). The study will consist of two treatment periods of 4 weeks.

             continuously for at least 12 months

          -  Participants must be using an insulin pump with &quot;rapid-acting insulin&quot; for at least 6
             months and the same &quot;rapid acting insulin&quot; for at least the past 30 days

          -  Participants must have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values ≥6.0% and ≤8.0%

          -  Participants must have been using the MiniMed 670G insulin pump for at least the past
             90 days

          -  Participants must use their Guardian (3) sensor at least an average of 75% of the time
             and remain in Auto Mode an average of 70% of the time

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not have had more than 1 emergency treatment for very low blood
