      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of galinpepimut-S in combination with pembrolizumab
      in patients with selected advanced cancers. Patients will be followed long-term for Overall
      Survival (OS) and safety. The study will enroll approximately 90 patients and maximum study
      treatment duration is approximately 2.13 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter, multi-arm study of the Wilms
      Tumor-1 (WT1)-targeting multivalent heteroclitic peptide immunotherapeutic vaccine
      galinpepimut-S in combination with the programmed death-1 (PD1) inhibitor pembrolizumab in
      patients with selected advanced cancers. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of
      galinpepimut-S and pembrolizumab and investigate the effect of galinpepimut-S and
      pembrolizumab on various tumor types. Patients will be followed long-term for OS and safety.
      The study will enroll approximately 90 patients at up to 20 centers in the United States.

      Indications treated are colorectal (third or fourth line), ovarian (second or third line),
      small cell lung cancer (second line), breast cancer (triple negative; second line), acute
      myelogenous leukemia (unable to attain deeper morphological response than partial [PR] on
      hypomethylating agents and who are not eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant).

      The first 2 galinpepimut-S injections will initially be administered as monotherapy every 3
      weeks (Week 0 and Week 3). Thereafter, galinpepimut-S will be co-administered with
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for 4 additional administrations (for the galinpepimut-S initial
      immunization induction phase series; weeks 6-15) to coincide with the per label pembrolizumab
      dosing frequency. After that, there will be one un-paired administration of pembrolizumab
      (week 18), and then galinpepimut-S will be resumed on an every 3-week schedule for 6
      additional doses (early immune booster phase; weeks 21-36). At the end of this phase, there
      will be a 12-week interval where 3 unpaired administrations of pembrolizumab will occur
      (weeks 39-45), and then galinpepimut-S will be resumed on an every 12-week schedule for 4
      additional doses (late immune booster phase; weeks 48-84). After 84 weeks, continuing
      non-progressed patients will be treated with pembrolizumab alone up until week 111.

      Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks on Day 1
      of each cycle (3 week cycles) starting on Study Week 6 and continuing for up to 2 years
      thereafter (Study Week 111). Galinpepimut-S will be administered 30-60 minutes after the
      completion of IV infusion of pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each cycle during which the 2 drugs
      are being co-administered.

             cancer managed clinically with &quot;watchful waiting&quot; are eligible.

          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging

             (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form
             of systemic treatment and is allowed.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

             or C infections, or known to be positive for Hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg)/ Hepatitis B
             virus (HBV) DNA or Hepatitis C Antibody or RNA are excluded. Active Hepatitis C is
             defined by a known positive Hep C Ab result and known quantitative HCV RNA results
             greater than the lower limits of detection of the assay.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. This
             includes any serious, intercurrent, chronic, or acute illness, such as cardiac disease
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness
             considered by the investigator as an unwarranted high risk for investigational drug
             treatment.

          -  Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the
             participant's ability to cooperate with the requirements of the study.

          -  For female subjects: Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or
             father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the
