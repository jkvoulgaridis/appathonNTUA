  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to develop a smartphone application capable of monitoring
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) in people who have survived a stroke or transient
      ischemic attack (TIA) or people who are at risk for a stroke and are age 50 and older. The
      study team plans to develop a highly effective and easy to use cardiovascular surveillance
      system to monitor patients for pAF on a nearly continuous basis. People involved in the
      development of this system include patients, their caregivers, health care providers, and
      computer programmers.

    <measure>Usability of Pulsewatch System: System usability scale &amp; Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 14 days post the first randomization</time_frame>
    <description>System usability scale, self- reported, of likes, dislikes and problems encountered with the smartphone application and smartwatch. Each items regarding likes and dislikes will be scored 1-5 (1= strongly disagree; 5= strongly agree or Didn't use). Problem encountered will be scored with yes or no options with space provided for explanations. Also, using Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) App Classification questions will capture the participants experience with the application. Each MARS item uses a 5-point scale (1=inadequate, 2=poor, 3=acceptable, 4=Good, 5=Excellent) and sub-scales will have an average mean to indicate overall rating of the application.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Detection of Atrial Fibrillation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed throughout 14 day trial period</time_frame>
    <description>Episodes of atrial fibrillation will be identified by the smartwatch bio-sensors and compared to the gold-standard monitor (Cardea Solo by Cardiac Insight).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 14 days post the first randomization, and at the last study visit 30 days post the second randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), a revised version of the anxiety module from the Patient Health Questionnaire, which consists of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for generalized anxiety disorder over the past 2 weeks. The GAD-7 score ranges from 0-27 with scores of 5, 10 and 15 representing validated cut-points for mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety symptoms, with a score â‰¥10 having high sensitivity (0.89) and specificity (0.82) for psychiatrist diagnosed anxiety disorder and correlates significantly with health-related QoL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 14 days post the first randomization, and at the last study visit 30 days post the second randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (SF-12) health survey to assess health related quality of life, this validated instrument domains include general health questions and mental health related questions. Scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate higher level of health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Activation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 14 days post the first randomization, and at the last study visit 30 days post the second randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Patient activation refers to a patient's ability and willingness to manage their health. Activation will be measured using the 10-item Consumer Health Activation Index (CHAI). Scores range from 10 to 60. The higher the score, the higher the activation the patient has for self-management of their condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disease Management Self-Efficacy: The General Disease Management scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 14 days post the first randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy for disease management is associated with engagement in health behaviors and with improved medication adherence. The General Disease Management scale is a 5-item scale assessing confidence in disease self-management (scores 0-50, higher scores = greater confidence). The Symptom Management scale is a 5-item scale assessing confidence in managing chronic disease symptoms (items tailored to sample).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 14 days post the first randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured using the 12-item Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS), a well-validated measure of patient-reported adherence.ARMS scores range from 1-4 (higher scores=poorer adherence).</description>
