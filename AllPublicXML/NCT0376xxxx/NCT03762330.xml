    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of of a structured self-management intervention plan in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary care setting.Half of the
      participants will receive the self-management plan while the other half will receive usual
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a great magnitude public health problem with
      an associated increased mortality and a high cost (consumption of health care resources and
      loss of health related quality of life (HRQoL)). The comprehensive approach to this complex
      disease, focusing self-care promotion, improves HRQoL and the patients‟ clinical status, as
      shown by several studies, although further investigation is needed to confirm these results
      in the field of Primary Care (PC) and to formulate clear recommendations on the more
      effective type of intervention.

      Hypothesis: In (moderate-severe) COPD patients, a structured self-management intervention
      plan in the setting of primary care, is more effective than usual treatment on the main
      outcomes associated with the disease: HRQoL, lung function, exacerbations and hospital
      admissions, at 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up.

      Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a comprehensive intervention plan to promote self-care
      and improve HRQoL in people with COPD in PC.

      Methods: Multicenter randomized controlled trial, conducted at PC centers in Barcelona.

      Determinations: Specific standardized and validated questionnaires, as the St George's
      Respiratory for the HRQoL. Statistical analysis: Intention to treat analysis. Descriptive
      statistics of the variables of the intervention and the control group to assess their
      homogeneity at the beginning of the study. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to
      assess differences among intervention groups.

      Expected results: A significant improvement in HRQoL attributable to the intervention
      performed in patients with COPD Applicability and Relevance: To implement the intervention
      plan in clinical practice and to standardize its content.

    <description>St. George´s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in patients with obstructive airways disease.
Number of items: 50 items Number of domains &amp; categories : 2 parts (3 components). Part 1 : Symptoms component (frequency &amp; severity) with a 1, 3 or 12-month recall (best performance with 3- and 12-month recall); Part 2: Activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness; Impact components (social functioning, psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease) refer to current state as the recall.
Scaling of items Part I (Symptoms): several scales; Part II (Activity and Impacts): dichotomous (true/false) except last question (4-point Likert scale). Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>

    <description>Goldberg's anxiety-depression scale (GADS): is an 18-item self-report symptom inventory that was developed by Goldberg and colleagues from 36 items in the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule. The GADS score is based on responses of 'yes' or 'no' to nine depression and nine anxiety items, asking how respondents have been feeling in the past month. Goldberg et al. (1988) considered patients with anxiety scores of 5 or more or with depression scores of 2 or more as having a 50% chance of a clinically important disturbance</description>
