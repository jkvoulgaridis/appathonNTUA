  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to enroll pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and follow
      their glycemic outcomes prospectively throughout pregnancy and into the post-partum period.
      The investigators anticipate that when compared to subjects using an Artificial pancreas
      system (AP) as part of a future protocol, this comparator group of subjects undergoing usual
      care will exhibit less time in target continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose range
      defined as 63-140 mg/dL and an increased duration of hypoglycemia with CGM glucose &lt;63 mg/dL.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. Data collected will include records of continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) based glucose, insulin delivery, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG),
      and maternal and fetal outcomes from pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. These data will be
      used to: (1) develop and refine algorithms for an AP system tailored to the needs of pregnant
      women with type 1 diabetes, (2) to serve as a comparator group for concurrent AP protocols,
      (3) describe Dexcom G6 CGM data throughout the pregnancy, and (4) describe insulin changes
      which occur in pregnancy.

          -  Cystic fibrosis

          -  A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere
             with the completion of the protocol such as the following examples:

               -  Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months

               -  Abnormal renal function test results (calculated GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2); testing
                  required for subjects with diabetes duration of greater than 5 years post onset
                  of puberty

               -  Active gastroparesis

                  meningitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis)

               -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension (Resting diastolic blood pressure &gt;95mmHg
                  and/or systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg) at the time of screening

               -  Chronic oral steroid use

          -  A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication, any
             carcinogenic disease, or other significant medical disorder if that injury, medication
             or disease in the judgment of the investigator will affect the completion of the
