    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) to usual care
      occupational therapy in children with perinatal brachial plexus injury. Participants are
      randomized to receive either the intervention (CIMT) or control first, then cross over to
      receive the other one.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with perinatal brachial plexus injury routinely receive occupational therapy
      intervention to improve strength and function in their weak or paralyzed arm.

      Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is known to increase upper extremity function in
      children with weakness or disuse as a result of cerebral palsy. However, it is unknown if
      this therapy is effective for treating arm weakness or disuse as a result of perinatal
      brachial plexus injury. The addition of CIMT to usual and standard occupational therapy care
      is evaluated in this trial.
