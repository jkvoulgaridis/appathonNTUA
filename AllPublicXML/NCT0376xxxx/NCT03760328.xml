  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper Airway Stimulation is a new therapy, which is available for patients with obstructive
      sleep apnea, who are non-compliant to the standard treatment continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) therapy. This study is a prospective, multi-center, double-blinded,
      randomized crossover study conducted under a common protocol. The study visits include
      baseline with an in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) after six months of therapy usage,
      followed by visits and in-lab PSGs at 1 and 2-weeks where the Therapy stimulation will be
      changed at each, according to randomization. The objective of this randomized controlled
      crossover study is to assess treatment effect of Inspire UAS in patients at different time
      points with two different therapy settings. This study will provide additional clinical
      evidence of Inspire UAS for treatment of moderate to severe OSA using a randomized controlled
      crossover trial design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent episodes of airflow obstruction
      in the upper airway that results in oxygen desaturations and arousal from sleep. The most
      common symptom of OSA is excessive daytime sleepiness. Recent studies have also shown clear
      association of OSA with the development of obesity, hypertension diabetes mellitus, and
      congestive heart failure. Approximately 13% men and 6% women have moderate to severe OSA
      (apnea hypopnea index, AHI ≥ 15) in the US.

      The efficacy of therapies for OSA, and in particular, continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) has been limited due to patient intolerance, poor patient selection, or limited
      response to the therapy.

      The Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation (UAS) system is intended to prevent upper airway
      obstruction by stimulating the hypoglossal nerve synchronous with respiration [7].

      The Inspire system is comprised of the following components:

        -  Inspire Upper Airway Stimulator (Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG))

        -  Inspire Stimulation Lead

        -  Inspire Sensing Lead

        -  External programmers used with the system are:

             -  Inspire Programmer (physician programmer)

             -  Inspire Patient Programmer (patient remote)

      The Inspire system received CE Mark in 2010 (CE Certificate No. 562872) providing the
      regulatory authority to provide the device in a commercial setting. Furthermore, this study
      will be conducted within the CE marked intended use of the Inspire system and will not
      involve any additional stressful or invasive tests.

      The objective of this randomized controlled crossover study is to assess treatment effect of
      Inspire UAS in patients at different time points with two different therapy settings. This
      study will provide additional clinical evidence of Inspire UAS for treatment of moderate to
      severe OSA using a randomized controlled crossover trial design.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, crossover study, conducted under a common protocol. Subjects will be enrolled after they have been implanted and using the Inspire therapy (Inspire II/IV, Inspire Medical Systems, Maple Grove, USA) for at least six months. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: therapeutic stimulation or sham stimulation. During the second phase of the study therapy settings of the stimulation system will be adjusted to crossover.</intervention_model_description>
