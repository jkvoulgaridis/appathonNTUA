    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors with measurable lesions per RECIST v1.1
             that are considered nonamenable to surgery or other curative treatments or procedures.
             Tumor lesions located in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to
             other loco-regional therapy, are considered measurable per RECIST v1.1 if progression
             has been demonstrated in the lesion.

          -  Willingness to undergo a tumor biopsy to obtain tumor tissue,Pretreatment and
             on-treatment tumor biopsies are required.

          -  Must have disease progression after treatment with available therapies that are known
             to confer clinical benefit or who are intolerant to or ineligible for standard
             treatment. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.

          -  Part 2 Expansion Cohort 2-A only: Participants with any type of solid tumor that has a
             local regulatory approval for an anti-PD-1 therapy. Other tumor types may be enrolled
             with medical monitor approval. Participants must have had confirmed disease
             progression on a prior anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

          -  Part 2 Expansion Cohort 2-B only: Participants with select solid tumors who are
             immunotherapy-naïve.

          -  Part 3 MSI-H or dMMR Expansion Cohort only (Enrolled ex-United States only):
             Participants with any MSI-H or dMMR solid tumor who are immunotherapy-naïve.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory values not within the Protocol-defined range.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  History or presence of an ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically
             meaningful.

          -  Untreated brain or central nervous system (CNS) metastases or brain or CNS metastases
             that have progressed. Participants who have previously treated and clinically stable
             brain or CNS metastases and have not required steroids for at least 7 days before
             study treatment are eligible.

          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or
             complications from prior surgical intervention before starting study treatment.

          -  Treatment with anticancer medications or investigational drugs within protocol-defined
             intervals before the first administration of study drug.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection or risk of reactivation.

          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Known hypersensitivity or severe reaction to any component of study drug or
             formulation components.

          -  Prior receipt of an anti-PD-L1 therapy for all participants.
