  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders and disturbances are mostly underestimated in clinical practice. Moreover,
      this problem is generally neglected by the pregnant themselves. Today, it is important to
      underline any problem that may have an affect to improve the quality of life during
      pregnancy.

      This study assesses the sleep quality, insomnia patterns and obstructive sleep apnea in the
      second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with uncomplicated pregnancy in the second or third trimester who apply for the routine
      check will be included.

      Specific questionnaires will be used to measure the sleep disorders in addition to the
      socio-demographic measures:

      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Berlin Questionnaire and Stop-Bang
      Questionnaire.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 39 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The order of the PSQI items has been modified from the original order in order to fit the first 9 items (which are the only items that contribute to the total score) on a single page. Item 10, which is the second page of the scale, does not contribute to the PSQI score. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berlin Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 39 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 3 categories related to the risk of having sleep apnea. Patients can be classified into High Risk or Low Risk based on their responses to the individual items and their overall scores in the symptom categories. High Risk: if there are 2 or more categories where the score is positive. Low Risk: if there is only 1 or no categories where the score is positive.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stop-Bang questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 39 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire evaluates the risk of sleep apnea. Low risk of OSA: Yes to 0-2 questions Intermediate risk of OSA: Yes to 3-4 questions High risk of OSA: Yes to 5-8 questions or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + male gender or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + neck circumference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 39 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ISI measures the insomnia and related parameters. Scoring and Interpretation as follows: Add the scores for all seven items (questions 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 +6 + 7) will give the total score. Total score categories: 0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia 8-14 = Subthreshold insomnia 15-21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity) 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe)</description>
