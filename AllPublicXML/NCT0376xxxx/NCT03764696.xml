  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplementary oxygen is routinely administered to patients, even those with adequate oxygen
      saturations, in the belief that it increases oxygen delivery. However, oxygen delivery
      depends not just on arterial oxygen content but also on perfusion.

      Maternal oxygen administration has been used in an attempt to lessen fetal distress by
      increasing the available oxygen from the mother. However, the effect of supplemental maternal
      oxygen therapy on fetal acid base status has been debated for more than seven decades.

      The investigators found the use of 2 L/min maternal oxygen during the second stage of labor
      did not adversely affect either the umbilical artery pH value or the fetal heart rate (FHR)
      pattern distribution.

    <description>The Apgar scale is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from 0 to 2, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from 0 to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration). The infant is given a score of 0, 1 or 2. The scores are added up and the total sum is their Apgar score.
The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low.</description>
