  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian men. While the
      majority of PCa is slow growing and responds well to first line treatment, a proportion of
      cases (10%) progress to metastatic form resulting in more than 4 000 deaths annually in
      Canada and 250 000 worldwide. Currently, first line treatment for PCa includes surgery,
      radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A rapid evolution in the understanding of
      disease biology, combined with approvals of new therapies including immunotherapy, novel
      chemotherapy, hormonal agents and a bone calcium matrix-targeted radionuclide, along with
      further drugs in development, have made treatment decisions for metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) increasingly complex and challenging.

      This is a Phase II Study of Cabazitaxel plus prednisone in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The current study is designed to determine if
      cabazitaxel will improve progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).

      This study will enroll patients with mCRPC, who have been previously treated and progressed
      under docetaxel or abiraterone regimen.

      Patients must meet the study eligibility criteria and must be competent to give informed
      consent.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, national, randomized, open label study, comparing the
      efficacy of cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² plus prednisone (Arm A) over docetaxel at 75mg/m2 plus
      prednisone (Arm B) after enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily or abiraterone acetate at 1000 mg
      once daily plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC who have progressed on
      abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.

      Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's
      refusal of further study treatment.

      All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either arm A or B in a 1:1 proportion.

          -  Progressive disease (PD) while receiving AR targeted therapy with abiraterone acetate
             or enzalutamide by at least one of the following:

          -  Progression in measurable disease (RECIST 1.1 criteria). Patient with measurable
             disease must have at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be at least 10 mm when
             measured by computed tomography (CT) [CT scan thickness no greater than 5 mm] or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lymph nodes should be ≥ 15 mm in short axis. As
             defined by PCWG2, if lymph node metastasis is the only evidence of metastasis, it must
             be ≥ 20 mm in diameter when measured by spiral CT or MRI. Previously irradiated
             lesions, primary prostate lesion and bone lesions will be considered non-measurable
             disease, and/or

          -  Appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions. They must be confirmed by other imaging
             modalities (CT; MRI) if ambiguous results (PCWG2), and/or

          -  Rising PSA defined (PCWG2) as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented
             over a reference value (measure 1) taken at least one week apart. The first rising PSA
             (measure 2) should be taken at least 7 days after the reference value. A third
             confirmatory PSA measure is required (2nd beyond the reference level) to be greater
             than the second measure and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure.
             If this is not the case, a fourth PSA measure is required to be taken and be greater
             than the 2nd measure. The third (or the fourth) confirmatory PSA should be taken
             within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  A PSA value of at least 2 ng/mL is required at study entry.

          -  Effective castration (serum testosterone levels ≤0.5 ng/mL).
