      Groups (intervention group receives 50000 IU vitamin D and control group receives placebo)
      through a random allocation. After 8 weeks, blood sample will be collected from each
      participant. The studied indices (inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, hs-CRP), PTH, platelet
      serotonin, serum oxytocin, serum 25(OH) D, depression status and anthropometry indices) will
      be evaluated at beginning and end of interventional period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 60 patients aged 18-60y referred to Baharlou
      hospital with a history of mild to moderate depression diagnosed by a psychiatrist will be
      presented to the researcher. After receipt of a signed informed consent form, eligible
      patients will participate. A general demographic questionnaire will be completed by an
      interviewer. Individuals are randomly divided into intervention and control groups. A 10-ml
      venous blood sample will be collected from each participant. The intervention group receives
      50000 IU of vitamin D every 2 weeks as vitamin D supplements for 8 weeks, provided monthly.
      The control group receives placebo. The drug schedule of both groups (if any) will be
      unchanged according to the prescribing physician. After 8 weeks, blood sample will be
      collected from each participant. The studied indices (inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, hs-CRP),
      PTH, platelet serotonin, serum oxytocin, serum 25(OH) D, depression status, anthropometry
      indices) will be evaluated at beginning and end of interventional period. Data will be
      analyzed by statistical tests.
