  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic and pervasive loneliness has been identified as an important factor in the
      relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) (e.g. abuse and neglect) and mental
      disorders. However, the mechanisms determining loneliness after ACE are still needed to be
      disentangled. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the differential effect of ACE on
      alterations in cognition and the link between ACE and loneliness with an emphasis on the
      effect of type and timing of ACE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rationale of the detrimental effects of loneliness on mental and physical health may
      be based on the interactions between genetic predispositions and social-environmental
      influences (e.g. ACE) via affecting neurobiological and cognitive processing, goals of this
      project are 1) characterization of loneliness to understand whether people suffer from
      mental/somatic disorders, feel lonelier and this effect is particularly strong in those with
      a history of ACE, 2) understanding the determinants of chronic loneliness by investigating
      certain personality dispositions such as rejection sensitivity and justice sensitivity,
      genetic predisposition for loneliness and social environments during childhood and
      adolescence and 3) inquiring into the social-cognitive correlates of these potential
      determinants in people's life today

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 mins</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item on a scale from 1 (Never) to 4 (Often). Ratings are summed up by taking the reversed items into consideration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (RSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 mins</time_frame>
    <description>Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire will be used to measure the cognitive and affective components of the rejection experience, namely rejection expectancy and rejection concern. RSQ involves nine hypothetical interpersonal situations to measure how respondents would feel or think in stated situations. Items are answered on a 6-point Likert scale from 1= &quot;very unconcerned&quot; to 6= &quot;very concerned&quot; for the rejection concern and 1= &quot;very unlikely&quot; to 6= &quot;very likely&quot; for the rejection expectancy. By multiplying the results of the two levels, total rejection sensitivity score is calculated and higher scores indicate higher sensitivity to rejection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Justice Sensitivity Inventory (JSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 mins</time_frame>
    <description>JSI includes for questionnaire scales assessing victim, observer, beneficiary and perpetrator sensitivity on four subscales. Scores for each subscale range from 0 to 50 based on 10 items (6-point rating scale ranging from 0 to 5). Higher scores indicate a higher sensitivity to justice. JSI involves 4 each have 2 dimensions in terms of the applicability of the question for the self and the others.</description>
