  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by recurrent nocturnal respiratory
      interruptions, resulting from the total or partial collapse of the upper respiratory ways.
      This results into sleep fragmentation, metabolic and biological disorders, which alter the
      neuropsychological and cardiovascular systems. Nowadays, 24% of men and 9% of women aged 30
      to 60 years disclose already an asymptomatic and underdiagnosed sleep disorder breathing
      (SDB). In subjects suffering from cardiovascular disease, prevalence of SDB is higher than in
      the general population, reaching 87% in people with resistant hypertension, 51% in those with
      heart failure and 62% in those with atrial fibrillation (to cite a few).The current
      diagnostic tool for SDB is polysomnography (PSG), but this is an expensive, time-consuming
      and uncomfortable tool, which limits its wide-spread use despite the high frequency of SDB in
      general and, even more, in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Several screening
      devices exist in order to test those patients at risk of SDB, but these have several
      limitations, since they are not recommended in patients who are asymptomatic for apnoea, in
      those with cardiorespiratory diseases, nocturnal arrhythmias or neurological and metabolic
      co-morbidities. In other words, nowadays there isn't an efficient screening tool of SDB,
      mainly for those with a low pre-test probability of having SDB.

      Preliminary evidence suggests that the seismocardiography (SCG) and the ballistocardiography
      (BCG) can detect nocturnal awakening and sleep disturbances with a good sensitivity and
      accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art PSG. Simultaneous recording of SCG and BCG is
      called kinocardiography (KCG) and has not been performed yet during sleep.

      The main hypothesis tested in this study is that the KCG provides sensitive and accurate
      measures of obstructive and central apnoea as compared to the state-of-the-art PSG. The
      secondary hypotheses are related to modifications in the SCG and BCG signals during the
      apnoea and the effects of continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) therapy. These hypotheses
      will be tested through a series of studies in normal volunteers and patients, as follow:

        -  Group RESPIRATOIRYSIMUL (Study A): voluntary end-expiratory breathing cessations periods
           and obstructive voluntary apnoea's (n=46);

        -  Group SBD (Study B): patients admitted for complains of sleep disturbances without
           cardiovascular and/or respiratory abnormalities which could induce artifacts in the KCG
           recording (n=50);

        -  Group nCPAP (Study C): patients treated by nCPAP therapy (n=50);

        -  Group UNSELECTED (Study D): unselected consecutive patients (n=100), without recruitment
           restrictions.

      Study A is an interventional study on voluntary breath holding in normal volunteers. Studies
      B, C and D are observational investigations recruiting subjects referred for PSG as required
      by their medical condition. Because the KCG device is not intrusive, the investigators do not
      anticipate difficulties in the enrollment. This study will not affect in any manner the
      regular medical care of the patients admitted to the sleep laboratory.

      To conclude, SDB is a widespread disease with detrimental health effects and its prevalence
      is supposed to increase in future years. PSG is the gold standard for diagnosis of SDB but it
      is an expensive, uncomfortable and time-consuming tool, limiting its use in daily clinical
      practice. For subjects with a high pre-test probability of SDB, portable, inexpensive and
      easy-to-use tools have been proposed as sleep monitoring and seem to provide accurate
      estimates of SDB. Although such devices seem promising, they disclose also several
      limitations and are not universally accepted as SDB screening devices, mainly in case of low
      pre-test probability of SBD. The less cumbersome KCG may screen patients for SDB accurately.
      One of its unique features is also that it can directly identify the consequences of SDB and
      nCPAP therapy on the cardiovascular system, and in especially the presence of frequently
      associated cardiac arrhythmias. With a more efficient pre-screening, those who are most
      likely to be eligible for nCPAP therapy will have a better access to the currently existing
      sleep laboratory facilities. The present research project has thus the potential of improving
      SDB patients care and health, at no additional societal costs.

    <description>In 46 healthy subjects, a computer program will generate random instructions of periods of normal breathing, voluntary end-expiratory breathing cessation periods (as surrogate of central apnoea) and Muller's manœuvre (as surrogate of obstructive apnoea). Meanwhile, the KCG will record the parameters of biological interest. ECG, heart rate, beat to beat non-invasive blood pressure (Finometer), ventilation, end-tidal CO2 (AD instruments), O2 saturation (Nellcor), cardiac output (CO) (Philips) will also be recorded.</description>

    <intervention_name>Kinocardiography unintrusive recording</intervention_name>
    <description>The Kinocardiography (Kino) is a device which records the electric and mechanic function of the heart. The device comprises a combination of ECG recording, (6 degrees of freedom), accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The Kino device consists of a back and a chest housing in contact with the patient. The back housing is placed in the middle of the lower back of the patient, and the chest housing is placed on the chest (either on the sternum or on the costal grill at the apex of the heart). The housings are connected by two cables. Data obtained from the device are visualized on a digital application via a Bluetooth connection.
For the group A, the KCG records the cardiac signals while the patient performs specific respiratory manoevres, as describe above.
For group B, C, D, the KCG records the cardiac contraction during sleep along with the PSG recording.</description>
