      Pirfenidone (Pirespa®) is an anti fibrotic drug, which was approved in 2012 in the Republic
      of Korea for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A
      post-marketing survey was conducted following the approval to obtain data on the safety and
      efficacy of pirfenidone for IPF treatment in real-world practice.
