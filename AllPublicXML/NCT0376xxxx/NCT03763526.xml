  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a common problem in cancer patients. It negatively inﬂuences patients'
      prognosis and quality of life. In gastrointestinal patients, it is also caused by insufﬁcient
      food intake due to dysphagia, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, impaired digestion and
      absorption.

      Furthermore, influence of prior oncologic treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and
      radiotherapy), have been associated with prolonged hospital stay, more postoperative
      complications and low survival outcome1-4. So, the proper assessment of nutrition status to
      detect perioperative malnutrition may allow appropriate nutritional therapy and improve
      survival5.

      However, the important factor which prolongs survival rate is good preoperative nutrition
      status because it effects the postoperative nutrition outcome. The objective of this study is
      to correlate the association between pre- and postoperative nutrition status and surgical
      outcomes.

      The Nutrition Alert Form (NAF) is a clinical tool for determining nutritional status. The NAF
      was modified from Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)6, and it is easy to use and does not
      require nutritional expertise based on laboratory and physical examination. Therefore, the
      NAF has been used extensively for screening of malnutrition in hospitalized Thai patients and
      it can classify the nutritional status into three groups : NAF-A (Normal-Mild malnutrition),
      NAF-B (Moderate malnutrition), NAF-C (Severe malnutrition)

      Primary Questions

      - What is the relationship between the preoperative nutrition status and the postoperative
      nutrition status in gastrointestinal cancer patients ?

      Secondary Questions

      - What is the relationship between malnutrition during preoperative and postoperative stages,
      compared with postoperative complications?

      OBJECTIVE :

      The objective of this study is to study the association between pre- and postoperative
      nutrition status compared with postoperative complications and surgical outcome. The results
      of this study may affect future nutrition practices and encourage different behaviors in
      gastrointestinal cancer patients who prepare to undergo surgery.

      Sample size is calculated by n=(z_(1-α/2)^2 p(1-p))/d^2

      Proportion (p) = 0.80, Error (d) = 0.064 Alpha (α) = 0.05, Z(0.975) = 1.959964 Power = 0.80
      Sample size (n) = 178 Include drop out 10 % = 196 patients

      Patients:

      For 196 gastrointestinal cancer patients (esophageal, gastric, colon and rectum cancer), who
      underwent scheduled surgery. Every patient underwent nutritional assessment by NAF before
      surgery and (1 &amp; 3 months) after surgery at in the Department of Surgery, Ramathibodi
      Hospital and Buriram Hospital from 20 November 2018. Patients with incomplete documents were
      excluded from this study.

      DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYSIS:

        -  Pre-operative nutrition status assess by NAF

        -  Post-operative nutrition status at 1 month and 3 months assess by NAF

        -  All postoperative complications were collected according to Clavin-Dindo Classification8

        -  All case were included in this study, following TNM staging and others pathologic
           parameters :

        -  Cancer type - Tumor grading

        -  Lymph node metastasis - Tumor depth
