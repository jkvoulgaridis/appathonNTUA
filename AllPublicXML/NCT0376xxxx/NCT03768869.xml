  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is possible to distinguish between pediatric oncology patients who are at high or low risk
      for serious infection during periods of fever and treatment related neutropenia based on
      clinical parameters. Patients with low risk can be safely treated as outpatients primarily
      using oral antibiotics. It is possible to improve methods of risk stratification through the
      addition of genomic and proteomic factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient management of patients considered to be at low risk for serious bacterial
      infection has been explored using risk stratification schema based on clinical parameters.
      First, patients will be stratified based on a clinical risk stratification schema. Patients
      stratified to the low risk group will be randomized between treatment using standard
      inpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy or outpatient antibiotic therapy using primarily an
      oral regimen. Second, an evaluation of proteins important to the innate immune system will be
      performed to provide a molecular characterization of episodes based on etiology. Third,
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes important for innate immunity will be evaluated to
      determine effect of each on infection risk during treatment induced neutropenia. Finally, we
      will develop a bank of both plasma and DNA specimens correlated with clinical outcomes for
      future use.
