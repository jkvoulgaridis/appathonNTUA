  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the postanesthetic care unit(PACU), patients who are recovering from anesthesia are not
      easy to communicate with. Accordingly, accurate evaluation of acute surgical pain is
      difficult for PACU patients in spite of severe postoperative pain. Therefore, pain evaluation
      is clinically important and challenging in PACU. The pain evaluation tool should be simple
      and easy to understand for accurate assessment. Among the most commonly used pain assessment
      methods are numerical rating scale(NRS), visual analogue scale(VAS) and verbal rating
      scale(VRS). These three methods have proved valid for clinical situations in many studies.
      VRS appears to be easier to understand than the other two methods for patients in PACU. The
      purpose of this study is to compare NRS and VRS in PACU patients.
