    <textblock>
      Currently, paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are widely used by emergency
      physicians in Turkey for the treatment of sore throat. The objective of the study is compare
      the efficacy of intravenous dexketoprofen and paracetamol in the treatment of the pain in
      patients presenting to the emergency department with sore throat

      This is the randomized double blinded clinical trial to compare the efficacy of these two
      drugs in this clinical setting. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Emergency
      Department (ED) of Pamukkale University Medical Faculty Hospital Study personnel (emergency
      physicians and emergency service nurses) were trained before the study.

      When intravenous drugs (Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen) was being recommended, an eligibility
      checklist was completed by the attending physician. Sore throat pain intensity scale was used
      to measure the severity of sore throat. According to the throat pain scale, patients with
      moderate-severe pain, at least 1 upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptom according
      URTI questionare, with objective findings of pharyngeal inflammation (Tonsillopharyngitis
      evaluation score ≥5), 60 mm or more according to the sore throat sensitivity scale (STSS), 50
      mm and above according to difficulty swallowing scale (DSS), 33 mm and above according to the
      swollen throat scale (SwoTS) were included in the study and evaluated according to these
      scales.

      First Group: 1000 mg of paracetamol ( parol 10mg/ml solution Mefar, Turkey) intravenous (IV)
      was given 100 patients, Second Group:

      dexketoprofen 50 mg ( arveles ampoule -IE Ulagay-Menarini, Turkey) intravenous (IV) was given
      100 patients which determined to be applied as a group.

      Drug packs prepared in 150 ml serum physiology were numbered by an independent nurse, who not
      involved in the study Randomization was achieved by using computer software to generate
      random numbers. During the intervention, participants were monitored by an oxygen saturation
      (SpO2) monitor, an automatic sphygmomanometer (blood pressure), and a rhythm monitor (heart
      rate and rhythms).

      Patients in both groups received two types of medication in a similarmanner, thus ensuring
      double blind.
