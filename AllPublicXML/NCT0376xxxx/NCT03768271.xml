  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, belonging to the wide
      spectrum of spondyloarthritis, but with the particularity to be associated with personal
      psoriasis or familial psoriasis. PsA can be a very disabling disease through progressive and
      irreversible joint damage. Long-term functional prognosis of patients with PsA is correlated
      with the presence and severity of the radiographic joint lesions of the disease.

      However, the proportion of patients who will develop those peripheral joint damages is not
      yet known and less over the factors which are associated/involved in such an aggressive
      pattern of the disease. Early identification of this subgroup of patients is particularly
      important for determining early &quot;intensive&quot; treatment, strict management with a Treat To
      Target approach, and identification of new treatments with a stronger structural effect.

      The main objective of this prospective 10 years cohort is to describe the 5 years structural
      (radiographic) severity of recent PsA with recent peripheral arthritis.Some of the secondary
      objectives are to describe the 10 years structural severity within those patients, and to
      determine the predictive factors of those 5 and 10 years radiographic lesions (genetic,
      environmental, clinic, therapeutic factors).

      APACHE will provide a unique longitudinal standardized database concerning patients with PsA
      with very recent peripheral arthritis. Research projects which will based on those collected
      data should allow to identify the mechanisms of aggressive joint damage, to highlight mew
      treatments targets, to better describe the burden of the disease, to test previous or develop
      new assessments tolls, to develop early diagnostic criteria

      Method:APACHE is a prospective national multicentre (26) cohort including and following
      during 10 years patients with a first peripheral arthritis in the past year, attributing to a
      PsA according to the treating rheumatologist. 425 patients will be included during a 2 years
      period before the follow-up. Standardized visits are planned throughout the 10 years
      follow-up, permitting the collection of various data:

        -  clinical data

        -  Patients Reported Outcome

        -  usual lab parameters

        -  plasma, serum and urines

        -  Baseline and one year RNA, DNA

        -  peripheral X-Rays, Ultrasounds and MRI at different time points Those visits have non
           interventional character (no therapeutic decision will be taken) Those collected data
           will allow submissions of many research projects to the scientific committee of the
           cohort.
