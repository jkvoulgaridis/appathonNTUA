  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The composition of a woman's vaginal microbiota has a significant impact on her reproductive
      tract health and general quality of life. Approximately one-third of all women currently have
      bacterial vaginosis (BV), a polymicrobial condition in which the vaginal microbiota is not
      dominated by Lactobacillus species, leading to increased risk of various reproductive tract
      maladies and negative impact on well-being. It has been suggested by epidemiological studies
      that vaginal microbiota are readily transferable from one woman to another. Here,
      investigators aim to explore the hypothesis that vaginal microbiota can be engrafted from one
      woman to another in a controlled clinical setting by using cervicovaginal secretions (CVS), a
      process referred to as vaginal microbiota transplant (VMT).

    <description>Determination of recurrence of BV in participants by Amsel's criteria. Amsel's criteria includes the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge, pH of the vagina being &gt; 4.5, the presence of clue cells in gram stained vaginal discharge smears and a positive whiff test. According to Amsel, if 3 of the 4 criteria are positive, the patient has bacterial vaginosis</description>

    <description>Determination of recurrence of BV in participants by Nugent score. The Nugent score is calculated by assessing for the presence of large Gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus morphotypes; decrease in Lactobacillus scored as 0 to 4), small Gram-variable rods (Gardnerella vaginalis morphotypes; scored as 0 to 4), and curved Gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes; scored as 0 to 2). A total score of 7 to 10 is consistent with bacterial vaginosis without culture.</description>
