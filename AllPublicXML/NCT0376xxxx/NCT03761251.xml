  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the short-term effects of incorporating the structured care of a pet
      fish into a diabetes self-care routine on glucose control in early adolescents with type 1
      diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of treatment for Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is dependent on adherence to
      self-care behaviors and collaborative parental involvement. Adolescence is a vulnerable time
      for the deterioration of glycemic control in patients with T1DM. In particular, parental
      monitoring declines during early adolescence. This often occurs before the child has
      developed self-efficacy and competence in independently performing diabetes-related tasks,
      including blood glucose monitoring. Consequently, there is a great need for innovative
      strategies in early adolescents that promote self-efficacy development and facilitate
      parental involvement.

    <description>Participants will be provided a fish tank with supplies to care for the fish and access to a fish (Betta splendens) from a local pet store. All participants will receive specific instructions for coupling the fish care and diabetes care:
feed fish one pellet in the morning after waking; check and record BG reading at that time
feed fish one pellet in the evening before dinner; check and record BG reading at that time
feed fish one pellet at night before bedtime; check and record BG reading at that time
every week clean the tank alternating with test the water quality in partnership with caregiver; review blood glucose readings with caregiver with each weekly fish care activity and problem solve any issues related to the blood glucose pattern.
Each child will also receive two books intended to supplement and enrich their pet fish experience.</description>

          -  duration of T1DM for at least one year

          -  fluency in English

          -  two recent consecutive HbA1c values 8.0 - 13%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  clinical or laboratory characteristics suggestive of type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  involvement in foster care

          -  regular usage of a continuous glucose monitor

          -  HbA1c &gt; 13% (because these individuals may need a more intensive intervention than
