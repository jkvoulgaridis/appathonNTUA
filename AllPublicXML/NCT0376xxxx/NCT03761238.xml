  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicentre study involving European centers
      with experience in the management of PHLF to assess the impact of early liver support with
      MARS on survival in patients with post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PHLF is a major risk factor for mortality in patients who underwent major hepatectomy. A
      specific treatment is yet not available. In a primary proof-of-concept study, it was shown
      that it is safe and feasible to use MARS in patients with PHLF early after hepatectomy.
      Survival was superior to a historical control group.

      This study will include patients with early, primary PHLF (based on the 50:50 criteria) after
      major liver surgery. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive standard treatment alone or
      standard treatment + liver dialysis using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System
      (MARS). Relevant outcome along with several physiological parameters will be assessed.
