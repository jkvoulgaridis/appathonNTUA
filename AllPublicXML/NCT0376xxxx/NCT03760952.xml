    <textblock>
      This screening study will identify HLA molecular subtype positive and tumor antigen target(s)
      positive patients who may be eligible for enrollment into Immatics clinical studies. This
      screening study is intended for patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid cancers. No
      treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this screening study is to identify human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecular
      subtype positive and tumor antigen target(s) positive patients. No treatment intervention
      will occur as part of this screening study.

      After diagnosis of advanced and/or solid metastatic cancers, patients will be tested for HLA
      molecular subtype positivity. Patients that are HLA molecular subtype positive are then
      assessed to determine if their tumor antigen target(s) is positive (biopsy screening). Fresh
      tumor tissue obtained by a biopsy for this screening study will be required. If the patient
      is undergoing a surgical procedure directed towards tumor or palliative treatment (e.g., a
      resection, debulking surgery, etc.) and has consented to the study, then fresh tissue may be
      collected during the procedure to avoid the patient being subjected to another biopsy.

      Tumor antigen targets in fresh tumor samples will be determined by an in vitro diagnostic
      (IVD) assay. Therefore, any remaining tumor specimens may be used for exploratory biomarker
      analyses and validation studies for regulatory approval.

      Immatics is conducting clinical studies which target patients with advanced and/or metastatic
      solid cancers. Patients who are HLA subtype phenotype positive and whose tumors express one
      or more of the tumor antigen targets of interest may be eligible for ongoing clinical studies
      of adoptive cell therapy (ACT).
