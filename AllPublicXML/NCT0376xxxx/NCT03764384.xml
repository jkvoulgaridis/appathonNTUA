      The study team propose that a new, hand-held test device may be valuable in the management of
      breathing failure in patients with Motor Neurone Disease (MND). The study team need to
      validate this device against the current gold standard of blood gas analysis and determine
      whether people with MND can use it at home. The new device, called 'N-Tidal C™' measures the
      carbon dioxide (CO2) in expired breath. At the end of the breath (end tidal) the CO2 level
      gives an indication of the CO2 in the person's arterial blood. Ventilatory failure is
      diagnosed at present using the value of CO2 in the arterial blood, but usually this can only
      be measured in specialist clinics. The study will determine if the end tidal CO2 measured by
      the new device agrees with CO2 measured on a blood test in clinic and also whether or not the
      device is practical for home use. The team will analyse the output of the device during home
      monitoring to see if changes in the pattern of CO2 in the expired breath identify, or even
      predict, the development of breathing failure in the community. With the results of these
      measures and detailed information about the patients in Papworth's clinic, recruited to this
      study, collected over a year the team will design a follow on study to see if using the new
      device at home can improve survival and quality of life for people with MND.

      This is a prospective, observational study of patients attending Royal Papworth Hospital's
      weekly MND clinic. If a patient decides to participate in the study, they will continue to
      receive all normal care. Researchers will ask permission to review the results of any medical
      investigations and tests previously undertaken, by looking in medical records and will
      collect new data prospectively. There will be two groups of patients recruited:

      A).Hospital Questionnaire Monitoring Group (12 months) for up to 200 patients who will:

      i) Have four routine hospital based assessments (every 3 months, standard care) ii) Above
      usual care: completion of the ALSFRS-R questionnaire at each clinic (4 in total. The ALSFRS-R
      (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Score-Revised) measures range of
      difficulties that people with MND can have in their daily lives. The results from this
      questionnaire help to measure the severity of MND symptoms, and how fast the disease is
      progressing. B). Home Device Monitoring Group (12-24 months) for 30 patients These
      participants patient will be given a portable monitoring device (called the N-Tidal C) to
      record their breathing pattern in clinic and at home and have: i) Four to six routine
      hospital based assessments (every 3 months, standard care). At the discretion of the
      investigator this may be at each clinic visit up to a total of 24 months ii) Completion of an
      ALSFRS-R symptom questionnaire at each visit (4-6 in total). At the discretion of the
      investigator this may be at each clinic visit up to a total of 24 months iii) Telephone
      consultation 2 weeks after commencing home monitoring to validate correct and safe use of the
      device (1 in total) iv) Completion of a supervised N-Tidal C breath record at each clinic
      visit (4 to 6 total). At the discretion of the investigator this may be at each clinic visit
      up to a total of 24 months v) Completion of a weekly symptom diary (up to 52 in total). At
      the discretion of the investigator this may continue up to 24 months vi) Home monitoring with
      N-Tidal C for 75 seconds, up to 3 times per day (up to study finish). SA 02 introduced an
      additional modified breath holding manoeuvre for home monitoring patients in clinic.

      The range of 4 to 6 assessments covers the eventuality that participants may start in group A
      and transfer to group B as their condition changes. This will be determined by the treating
      doctor and will be based upon their lung function, limb weakness and whether they (or a
      carer) are able to use the device. During the home monitoring trial, data collected by the
      N-Tidal C device will be downloaded at each clinic visit, to check that the device is
      correctly recording data. Researchers will not be able to analyse the data collected by the
      device.

      Only the information obtained from the standard measurements (standard care) will be used to
      decide when a patient needs help with their breathing at night time by starting a ventilator.
      A patient participating in the Home Monitoring Group will continue to use their N-Tidal C
      device to record their daytime breathing up to 3 times per day, after they start using a
      ventilator.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome of interest is the degree of agreement between end tidal CO2 measured by the N-Tidal CTM device and PaCO2 from arterial blood gas analysis.</measure>
    <time_frame>At each clinic visit through to study completion up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial blood gas (measured in kPa) will be compared to the end tidal CO2 (kPa) measured from the N-Tidal CTM device. The measurements will be taken within 20 minutes of each other. The paired CO2 measures from N-Tidal CTM device and from ABG will be assessed for agreement. The results will be displayed graphically using a Bland Altman Plot and the mean difference, the standard deviation of the mean difference and confidence intervals for 95% limits of agreement will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify when an MND patient requires additional support with their breathing, in the form of starting NIV as derived from the CO2 measurement (kPA) and Respiratory Rate (RR) per minute from the N-Tidal CTM device.</measure>
    <time_frame>At each clinic visit through to study completion up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The waveforms taken from the N-Tidal CTM device will be analysed to give an end tidal CO2 (kPa) value and the mean and standard deviation of Respiratory rate per minute. Assuming there is an acceptable level of agreement between the two methods of measuring CO2 the data will be reviewed to establish if the end tidal measurement identified the onset of ventilatory failure before the clinic visit where it was confirmed on an arterial blood gas. After inspection of the data a judgement will be made on whether the correct measure is an individual result &gt;6kPa or whether 2 or more consecutive measures &gt;6 kPa would be the most reliable measure to conclude that ventilatory failure has now developed. For those participants who develop a PaCO2 &gt; 6 kPa, the amount of time by which this predates the confirmatory blood gas will be reported in weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify when an MND patient develops a treatable respiratory condition, such as an infection as derived from the CO2 measurement (kPA) and Respiratory Rate (RR) per minute from the N-Tidal CTM device..</measure>
    <time_frame>At each clinic visit through to study completion up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mean end tidal CO2 (kPa) and the mean RR taken from the N-Tidal CTM device on the day before and the day of an identified respiratory event (from the symptom diary) will be examined to see if there is a reproducible change in the signal that might indicate that a respiratory event has occurred assuming in the future that the device will be monitored remotely.</description>

    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) to record 'ease of use' of the N-Tidal C™ device during the study and at study completion</measure>
    <time_frame>At each clinic visit through to study completion up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient outcome measure. VOTECO2ALS 'Ease of use Questionnaire' has been devised by the study team to gather patient feedback on their participation in the trial and how they have found using the device. The scale has a series of statements and patients are asked to choose one of the following 5 options; disagree strongly, disagree, neither agree or disagree, agree, agree strongly. A 'disagree' response would represent a poor outcome in regards to the study design and device use where as an 'agree' option would be a better outcome in regards to the study design and usability of the device. The feedback from the subjects on ease of use will be examined for common themes.</description>
