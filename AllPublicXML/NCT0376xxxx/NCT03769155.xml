      This pilot phase I trial studies how well VX15/2503 (pepinemab) with or without ipilimumab
      and/or nivolumab work in treating participants with stage IIIB-D melanoma that can be removed
      by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as VX15/2503, ipilimumab, and nivolumab may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 (pepinemab) in combination with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors on T cell infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment in involved and uninvolved
      lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors on the
      immune profile of involved and uninvolved lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

      II. Assess safety and tolerability of profile and tolerability of single agent VX15/2503 to
      the combination of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable
      metastatic melanoma.

      III. Document pathologic response rates of single agent VX15/2503 and combination VX15/2503
      and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable melanoma.

      IV. Compare pathologic response to radiographic response using Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients receiving single agent VX15/2503 and
      combination VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable melanoma.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 5 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and nivolumab IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo surgery between days 35-49.

      ARM II: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 21 and undergo surgery between days 35-49.

      ARM III: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes, nivolumab IV over 30 minutes, and
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo between days 35-49.

      ARM IV: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo
      between days 35-49.

      ARM V: Participants undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 90 days, every 12 weeks
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually up to 10 years.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Subjects with active or history of immune mediated pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis,

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA class
             III or IV), unstable angina pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Other medications, or severe acute/chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate
             for entry into this study.

          -  Clinical evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Patients with prior malignancies, including pelvic cancer, are eligible if they have
             been disease free for &gt; 5 years. Patients with prior non-melanoma skin cancers and in
             situ carcinomas are eligible provided there was complete removal.

          -  Active bacterial or fungal infections requiring systemic treatment within 7 days of
             treatment.

          -  Use of other investigational drugs (drugs not marked for any indication) within 28
             days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before study drug administration.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Non-oncology vaccines within 28 days prior to or after any dose of ipilimumab.

          -  Prisoners and subjects who are compulsory detained.
