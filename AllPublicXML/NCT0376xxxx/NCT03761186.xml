  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific basis for dietary recommendations in type 1 diabetes is almost lacking, with
      the current recommendations being based on type 2 diabetes studies. Therefore the overall
      purpose of this study is to improve the current evidence for dietary recommendations to
      people with type 1 diabetes.

      Study aim: To compare how a strictly low carbohydrate diet, a moderately low carbohydrate
      diet and a traditional diabetes diet (with higher amounts of carbohydrates) affect insulin
      requirements and metabolic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

      Carbohydrate intake is 50-60% of the total energy intake in the traditional diabetes diet,
      30-40% in the moderately low carbohydrate diet and 15-20% in the strictly low carbohydrate
      diet with a minimum of 50 g carbohydrates/day. A diet with less than 50 g carbohydrates/day
      is usually called very low carbohydrate diet or ketogenic and will not be tested in this
      study.

      Recruitment areas are Stockholm and Uppsala. Those who wish to participate and meet the
      inclusion criteria (and none of the exclusion criteria) will be randomized to one of the
      three diets. The duration of the intervention is 6 months after which the participants will
      be able to choose their own diet for another 6 months. The main study visits are at baseline
      (screening and study start), 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Shorter visits will be at 3 and 6 weeks.
      The participants will meet with a study nurse, dietitian and doctor. They will attend two
      carbohydrate counting courses before the start of the intervention in order to be able to
      match their insulin to the amount carbohydrates they eat. Participants will receive written
      materials about their diets with menus and recipes for better adherence to the diet.

      The primary endpoint is the change in insulin requirements within and between groups (for
      secondary endpoints please see relevant section). For assessing the different endpoints the
      participants will provide blood, urine and feces samples for lab analyses as well as register
      their insulin use, blood glucose, diet, physical activity and any blood ketones or
      hypoglycemia electronically or in written forms. Continuous/flash glucose monitoring
      (CGM/FGM) will be also used for 3-7 days before study visits. Dietary assessment and
      adherence will be based on 3-4 day food diaries before every scheduled study visit.

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire is designed to measure general well-being, including negative well-being, energy and positive well-being. The negative well-being scale score (range 0-12) is reversed and then summed with the Energy score (range 0-12) and Positive score (range 0-12) to produce a general well-being score (range 0-36). The higher the score the greater the sense of general well-being.</description>

    <description>The DTSQ has been developed to assess patient satisfaction with diabetes treatment. The questionnaire is composed of two different factors. The Ô¨Årst factor assesses treatment satisfaction and consists of six questions and the second factor consists of two questions, which assess the burden from hyper- and hypoglycemia. Treatment satisfaction is assessed as the sum of the scores of the six questions on the Ô¨Årst factor (total score 36), with a higher score indicating higher treatment satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric, measured in seconds and or minutes.</description>
