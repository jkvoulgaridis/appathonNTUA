  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves an exoskeleton which is believed to increase quadriceps muscle strength
      in the rehabilitation phase after TKA and reduce the discharge the such patients in Extended
      care facility (ECF) . The purpose of this study is to access efficacy of the robotic
      exoskeleton device wrapped around the operated knee on patients
