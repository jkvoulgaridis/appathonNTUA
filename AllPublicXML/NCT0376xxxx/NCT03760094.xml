  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphadenopathy is defined as an abnormality in the size or character of lymph nodes caused
      by the invasion or propagation of either inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the nodes
      Accurate lymph node characterization is important for a wide number of clinical situations,
      including prognosis, prediction, selecting and monitoring treatment, beyond the diagnosis
      itself (cancer, lymphoma, or inflammatory nodes)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various ultrasound criteria that can help in differentiation of benign and malignant lymph
      nodes have been well described in literature. On Gray scale ultrasound imaging, the benign
      enlarged lymph nodes are hypoechoic, oval shaped with smooth border and echogenic hilum. On
      the other hand, the malignant lymph nodes are round with short to long axis ratio &gt;0.5 and
      show loss of echogenic hilum, while the Color and Power Doppler features documented for the
      diagnosis of malignant lymph nodes are peripheral and mixed vascularity, with resistive index
      (RI) more than 0.8, and pulsatility index (PI) more than 1.5 Although Color Doppler
      ultrasound improves diagnostic accuracy and plays an important adjuvant role to Gray scale
      ultrasound in differentiating benign from malignant lymph nodes as it adds to the diagnostic
      confidence of predicting malignancy in enlarged lymph nodes, and also is useful if Gray scale
      ultrasound findings are equivocal. However, it can neither replace histopathology nor can
      eliminate the need for biopsy
