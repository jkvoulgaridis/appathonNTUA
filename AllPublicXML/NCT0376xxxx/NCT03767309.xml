      Management of Miller class I &amp; II gingival recession using coronally advanced flap combined
      with conventional de-epithelialized free gingival graft versus coronally advanced flap
      combined with abrasive de-epithelized connective tissue graft Null hypothesis: In patients
      with Miller class I and II gingival recession, there is no difference between coronally
      advanced flap with conventional de-epithelialized free gingival graft and coronally advanced
      flap with abrasive de-epithelized connective tissue graft in recession depth reduction.
