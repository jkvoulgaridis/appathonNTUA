    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the current surgical practices at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized
      Hospital in comparison to the World Health Organization's Surgical Unit Based Safety
      Programme guidelines and aims to determine how deviations from those guidelines are
      associated with varying rates of surgical site infection incidence in this population. The
      results of this study will help elucidate risk factors for surgical site infection and
      prioritize future interventions to decrease the rate of surgical site infection at Ayder
      Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, as well as other low and middle-income hospitals. The
      data collected regarding surgical site infection rates will also prove beneficial in
      measuring outcomes of any interventions that are developed as a result of this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the
      world with low and middle-income countries disproportionately affected with rates as high as
      30-40% compared to an average rate of less than 3% in high income countries. In addition to
      the grave clinical implications of these infections, the additional costs incurred by both
      patients and treating institutions can be catastrophic.

      The World Health Organization's &quot;Clean Care is Safer Care&quot; initiated quality improvement
      projects in five African hospitals between 2013 and 2015, demonstrating that low-cost
      interventions can decrease the rates of surgical site infection in low and middle-income
      countries. This successful initiative formed the basis of the World Health Organization's
      Surgical Unit Based Safety Programme guidelines.

      This will be a prospective cohort study collecting data about surgical practices, pre- and
      post-operative care and post-operative infection from time of admission through
      post-operative day 30. Patients will be identified when they are scheduled for surgery and
      undergo consent process. If they consent to participate in the study their clinical course
      will be followed through post-operative day 30. Inpatient observational data will be
      collected to determine whether current practices are in line with World Health Organization's
      Surgical Unit Based Safety Programme guidelines. Potential confounding risk factors for
      infection will be identified, and post-operative information will be collected through
      inpatient follow up as well as telephone calls on post-operative day ten and 30 to assess for
      signs or symptoms of surgical site infection.

        Male and female patients 18 years of age or older undergoing any surgical procedure in the
        main operating theaters at Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Mekelle, Ethiopia
        during the 12-month study period, not including cases involving permanent implants.
        Inpatient collection of data will occur prospectively with supplemental information
        recorded from medical records if patient consents. Post-discharge data will be collected
        for patients who consent for follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients (male and female) 18 years of age or older undergoing any surgery
             (elective, scheduled, urgent or emergent) including obstetrics and gynecology cases at
             ACSH in Mekelle Ethiopia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 18.

          -  Patients who undergo surgery involving permanent implants (as these patients would
             require follow up for 1 year to effectively rule out surgical site infection and this
             is beyond the data collection time frame of this study)
