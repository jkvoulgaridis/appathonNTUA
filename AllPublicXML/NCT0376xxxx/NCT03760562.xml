  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. In 2008,
      it was estimated that 0.8% of the United Kingdom adult population had used long-term (≥ 3
      months) glucocorticoids, rising to 3% in women aged over 80 years.

      The aim of the project is to investigate the dose-response estimates of risk of high blood
      pressure associated with oral glucocorticoids.

      Hypertension is a chronic condition which affects 1 in 5 of the world adult population. The
      cause of hypertension is unknown in about 95% of patients, whilst 5% are secondary to
      underlying adrenal disorders or other identifiable causes.

      Glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. In 2008,
      it was estimated that 0.8% of the UK adult population had used long-term (≥ 3 months)
      glucocorticoids, rising to 3% in women aged over 80 years. Glucocorticoids are effective in
      controlling underlying chronic inflammatory disease in majority of cases. However, their
      continuous use can result in a variety of complications, including hypertension.Although it
      is acknowledged that excess cortisol is a leading cause of hypertension, the role of
      exogenous glucocorticoids is less known.

      The aim of the project is to investigate the dose-response estimates of risk of high blood
      pressure associated with oral glucocorticoids.

      This is a retrospective cohort study of people diagnosed with at least one of six chronic
      inflammatory diseases (polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus
      erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease). This study
      will be based on the analysis of existing primary care health records routinely collected,
      linked to hospital and mortality data.

        cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis) in the period between 1st Jan 1998
