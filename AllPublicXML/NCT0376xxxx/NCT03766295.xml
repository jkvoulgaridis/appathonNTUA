  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with gemcitabine
      to placebo in combination with gemcitabine, in treatment of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer and who have pain related to the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to promote survival via
      modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor
      microenvironment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      masitinib in combination with gemcitabine with respect to placebo in combination with
      gemcitabine for the treatment of non resectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer patients with pain related to the disease. Approximately 330 patients with pain Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) &gt; 20 and/or treated with 'opioid analgesics' dose ≥ 1 mg/kg/day at
      baseline will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the masitinib and placebo arms, respectively.
      The primary outcome measure is overall survival (OS).

    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy.

        Main inclusion criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, non
             resectable locally advanced or metastatic stage

          2. Patient with pain related to the disease, as assessed by the investigator and the
             patient:

               -  Pain related to the disease as assessed by the investigator is defined as
                  clinical and documented evaluation by the investigator during physical
                  examinations at screening and/or baseline.

               -  Pain, as assessed by the patient is defined as at least one value out of two
                  values &gt; 20mm on Visual Analogue Scale at screening or baseline. Visual Analogic
                  scale consists in the visual representation of pain amplitude as perceived by the
                  patient. The amplitude is represented by a 100 mm long line having no reference
                  marks. One extremity indicates an absence of pain (0 value) and the other the
                  worst imaginable pain (100 value).

        OR

        - Patient treated with opioid analgesics at a dose ≥ 1 mg/kg/day (morphinic equivalent).

        3. Chemotherapy naïve patient for the advanced/metastatic disease

        Main exclusion criteria:

          1. Patient with no pain related to the disease (as defined in the inclusion criterion
             number 2)

          2. Pregnant or nursing female patient
