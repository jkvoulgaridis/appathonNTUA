  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of this study are to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography
      (blood vessel mapping) to:

        1. Detect retinal blood vessel and blood flow changes in participants with dementia.

        2. Detect amyloid protein deposits in the retinas of participants with dementia.

    <measure>Retinal amyloid protein detection</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>OCT and OCT angiography will be used to detect levels of amyloid proteins deposits within the retina layers before and after a regimen of curcumin supplement consumption. The curcumin will serve to enhance protein detection during imaging, with OCT and OCTA imaging taken on two occasions about 10 days apart. An increase in retinal amyloid protein detection is expected in the dementia group.</description>

    <description>OCT and OCT angiography will be used to detect blood flow in dementia vs dementia-free controls. OCT and OCTA imaging will be taken on two occasions about 10 days apart. Decreased blood flow is expected in the dementia group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) Imaging</intervention_name>
    <description>Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive imaging technology that provides cross-sectional images of tissues in micron-scale resolution. The angiography component of this device allows for evaluation of blood vessel and blood flow changes in the eye. The RTVue-XR device with AngioVue software will be used to detect these blood vessel and flow changes as well as protein deposits in the retinal layers. Subjects will take oral curcumin supplements to hyperfluoresce and improve detection of the amyloid proteins within the retinal layers.</description>

        Dementia subjects will be recruited from the Layton Aging &amp; Alzheimer's Disease Clinic at
        Oregon Health &amp; Science University. Dementia-free subjects will be recruited from those
        currently being followed in the Layton Aging &amp; Alzheimer's Disease Center longitudinal
        aging study with MRI and amyloid PET imaging.
