      The purpose of this study is to apply local heat to the legs, thighs and buttocks of patients
      with peripheral arterial disease and use PET/CT imaging with an injectable stable radiotracer
      to study direct measurement of blood flow in the legs pre and post heat treatment.

    <textblock>
      Cilostazol is the only effective medication available to treat walking pain (intermittent
      claudication) and it has multiple side effects. Overall improvement in walking performance in
      patients who use cilostazol is small. Endovascular and surgical interventions are effective
      alternatives for patients who don't respond to medical therapy, however, these procedures are
      costly and only applicable to patients with certain lesions types and carry a high risk of
      restenosis.

      Heat therapy (HT) is an emerging non-invasive approach that has been shown to enhance
      vascular function of the leg in old individuals. The objective of this study is to test the
      hypothesis that a single session of heat therapy will increase local muscle tissue blood flow
      in the calf of patients with PAD as assessed by PET/CT imaging of generator-based 62Cu-ETS.

      Subjects who have met inclusion criteria will volunteer for a single experimental visit.
      Participants will wear the water circulating pants and asked to rest supine for 30 minutes
      inside the scanner. Water at 43 degrees C will be perfused through the pants for 90 minutes
      with the goal to increase skin temperature in the calf to 39 degrees C. IV injections of
      62Cu-ETS and subsequent perfusion imaging will be performed at the end of the 30 minute
      baseline period, after 45 minutes of heat therapy and at the end of the intervention (90
      minutes). Due to the short half life of 62Cu, radioactivity from the prior administrations
      will not interfere with acquisition of a subsequent PET scan at this timing interval.
