  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia is the most frequent early-onset autosomal recessive hereditary ataxia. It
      is caused by a pathological expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of the frataxin
      gene (FXN) and results in decreased levels of FXN protein. FXN deficiency results in a
      relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition which frequently presents around
      puberty. Patients gradually lose coordination, become dysarthric and are frequently
      wheel-chair bound as adolescents. There is no disease modifying therapy and many patients die
      prematurely of cardiomyopathy. It was subsequently found that the FXN gene is silenced at the
      chromatin level by the formation of heterochromatin and that this heterochromatin formation
      can be antagonized by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) (Chan et al., 2013). A recent
      proof-of-concept clinical study on ten patients with Friedreich ataxia demonstrated that FXN
      levels can be restored to those seen in asymptomatic carriers using the class III HDACi
      nicotinamide at a dose that is well tolerated by patients (Libri et al., 2014). Since
      carriers are asymptomatic, this degree of restoration of FXN expression might be expected to
      halt disease progression. Nicotinamide readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has
      previously been given at high doses for long periods to normal individuals without serious
      adverse effects (Gale et al., 2004; Knip et al., 2000). This study will be the first to
      provide clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide in patients with
      Friedreich´s ataxia.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of daily doses of nicotinamide in slowing disease progression as measured by changes in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) as compared with placebo in patients with Friedreich ataxia.
The SARA is a tool for assessing ataxia. It has eight categories with accumulative score ranging from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia). When completing the outcome measure each category is assessed and scored accordingly. Scores for the eight items range as follows:
Gait (0-8 points), Stance (0-6 points), Sitting (0-4 points) Speech disturbance (0-6 points) Finger chase (0-4 points) Nose-finger test (0-4 points) Fast alternating hand movement (0-4 points) Heel-shin slide (0-4 points) Once each of the 8 categories have been assessed, the total is calculated to determine the severity of ataxia.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is a generic instrument, developed and validated by the EuroQoL Group (1990), in which the patient self-rates in particular his/her health status on a visual analogue scale (VAS); the best score is 100.</description>

    <measure>Modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Modified FARS scores are defined as the sum of scores for bulbar function, upper limb coordination, lower limb coordination, and upright stability. The mFARS consists of three subscales, comprising a general score for ataxia, a score for activities of daily living and a neurological examination. The scores can be added to make a total score ranging from 0 to 159. A higher score indicates a greater level of disability.</description>

    <description>CCFS includes two tests performed with the dominant hand,named the click test and the 9 holes pegboard test (9HPT). An electronic device was created to perform CCFS and to calculate the Z score by subtracting the expected time</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. and rated as: 1. Very much improved; 2. Much improved; 3. Minimally improved; 4. No change; 5. Minimally worse; 6. Much worse; 7. Very much worse</description>
