    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to test the safety, feasibility, and initial efficacy of combined 10
      week treatment of prolonged exposure (PE) and Pramipexole in patients with comorbid
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (MDD). Resting state functional
      connectivity (rsFC) will be assessed at baseline and en of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of the individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) present with
      major depressive disorder (MDD). Compared to PTSD alone, patients with comorbid PTSD-MDD
      demonstrate greater distress and poorer treatment outcome. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) show that relative to PTSD alone, PTSD-MDD is associated with decreased
      resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in both fear- and reward-processing circuits.
      In addition, our data suggest that Prolonged Exposure (PE), first-line PTSD treatment, may
      successfully target impairments in the fear circuits, but not in the reward circuits, which
      may explain the treatment-refractory quality of PTSD-MDD.

      The goal of this pilot study is to test the feasibility, safety and initial efficacy of an
      integrated therapeutic approach targeting both fear and reward impairments in PTSD-MDD
      patients. Specifically, the investigators will examine a combination treatment with PE, shown
      to effectively address fear circuitry deficits, and Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, shown to
      increase reward circuit function and to have promise in treating depression but not
      previously studied in PTSD. The central hypothesis is that combined PE/Pramipexole will a)
      improve PTSD and depressive symptoms in PTSD-MDD patients, and b) increase functional
      connectivity of fear and reward pathways as measured by fMRI rs-FC. In this pilot study, 15
      adults aged 18-60 years with PTSD-MDD will receive combined 10-week of PE and Pramipexole up
      to the maximum dose of 4mg a day. Clinical assessment will be conducted at baseline, week 5,
      post treatment and at 3-month follow up. Behaviorally assessments including the probabilistic
      reward task (PRT) and attention allocation tasks, and fMRI scans for resting state functional
      connectivity (rs-FC) will be conducted at baseline and end of treatment.

    <description>The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. It is a 30-item structured interview used for current (past week or month) and lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. The CAPS was designed to be administered by clinicians and clinical researchers who have a working knowledge of PTSD. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer. Scores range from 0 to 80 with higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a 17-item instrument that was designed to measure frequency and intensity of depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder. Ratings are made using either a five- or a three-point scale, yielding total scores from 0 to 61, with higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

Elements of PE include imaginal and in vivo exposure to trauma reminders; breathing retraining; cognitive restructuring; and PTSD psychoeducation.
Pramipexole: In addition to receiving PE as described above, patients will have Pramipexole treatment. Daily dose will be started at 0.25 mg/day and increased by 0.25 mg/day every 3-4 days to a target of 2.5mg day by week 5. Beginning week 6 daily dose will be increased weekly by 0.5 mg/day to a maximum dose of 4mg. Dose will be increased as tolerated unless the patient has achieved remission and will be decreased in the event of intolerable adverse events.</description>

        <title>Change in PTSD Symptoms as Measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</title>
        <description>The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. It is a 30-item structured interview used for current (past week or month) and lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. The CAPS was designed to be administered by clinicians and clinical researchers who have a working knowledge of PTSD. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer. Scores range from 0 to 80 with higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

            <description>Experimental: Prolonged Exposure (PE)/Pramipexole PE Therapy consists of 10 sessions of 90-minute duration, normally conducted once a week. In addition to receiving PE as described above, patients will have Pramipexole treatment.
PE/Pramipexole: Experimental: PE/Pramipexole PE Therapy consists of 10 sessions of 90-minute duration, normally conducted once a week. Elements of PE include imaginal and in vivo exposure to trauma reminders; breathing retraining; cognitive restructuring; and PTSD psychoeducation.
Pramipexole: In addition to receiving PE as described above, patients will have Pramipexole treatment. Daily dose will be started at 0.25 mg/day and increased by 0.25 mg/day every 3-4 days to a target of 2.5mg day by week 5. Beginning week 6 daily dose will be increased weekly by 0.5 mg/day to a maximum dose of 4mg. Dose will be increased as tolerated unless the patient has achieved remission and will be decreased in the event of intolerance.</description>

        <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a 17-item instrument that was designed to measure frequency and intensity of depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder. Ratings are made using either a five- or a three-point scale, yielding total scores from 0 to 61, with higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
