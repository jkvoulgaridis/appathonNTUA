  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to determine fusion rates and compare clinical outcomes of the
      NanoFUSE® Bioactive Matrix during post-market clinical use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NanoFUSE® is indicated to be placed into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system that are
      not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure (i.e. the posterolateral spine and
      pelvis). These defects may be surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created
      from traumatic injury to bone. NanoFUSE® must be used with autograft as a bone graft extender
      in the posterolateral spine and pelvis. This product provides a bone graft substitute that
      remodels into the recipient's skeletal system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Skeletally mature

             consistent with product labeling

          -  Psychosocially, mentally, and physically able to fully comply with the protocol,
             including the post-operative regimen, requires follow-up visits, filling out required
             forms, and the ability to understand and give written informed consent

          -  Retrospective data collection must be allowed by the IRB and all information
             deidentified

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous fusion surgery of the proposed site

          -  Use of chronic medications known to affect the skeleton (e.g. glucocorticoid usage &gt;

             excessive risk to surgery (e.g. significant circulatory or pulmonary problems, cardiac
             disease
