      In this study, a multicenter, prospective, synchronous blind, and controlled study was
      adopted to set the cut-off values of candida specific IgG, IgM, and Mn with the blood culture
      results as the gold standard, so as to evaluate the diagnostic value of candida specific IgG,
      IgM, and Mn levels in candida infection.

        1. the cut-off values of serum specific IgG, IgM and Mn of candida sinensis infected
           population in China were established by comparing the positive results of blood culture
           of 300 healthy people and 100 patients with positive candida sinensis blood culture as
           the gold standard and using ROC curve (ROC curve).

        2. 100 patients with positive tracheal aspiration culture and 100 patients with positive
           urine culture were enrolled. Serum levels of candida specific IgG, IgM and Mn were
           detected, and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
           value and likelihood ratio of candida specific IgG, IgM and Mn in tracheal aspiration
           and urine were evaluated.

        3. 200 high risk patients with candida infection were enrolled, and the aseptic fluid
           culture and the simultaneous detection of serum specific IgG, IgM and Mn were adopted to
           explore the diagnostic value of the detection method.

        4. positive candida culture in sputum and positive candida culture in tracheal aspirate
           were taken as the control group to compare the levels of IgG, IgM and Mn in serum of the
           two groups, and to explore the diagnostic value of different sampling methods for
           candida pulmonary infection.
