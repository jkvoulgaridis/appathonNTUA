  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of Anlotinib combined with Sintilimab (IBI 308) in
      participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received
      first-generation EGFR-TKIs resistance along with T790M negative.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants receive Sintilimab(IBI 308) 200 mg, administered as intravenous (IV) infusion on
      Day 1, Anlotinib 12mg, administered as PO on Day1-14 of each 21-day cycle until documented
      PD.The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants will have a longer Progression
      Free Survival (PFS), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
      (RECIST 1.1) when treated with Anlotinib plus Sintilimab(IBI 308).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first and was based on blinded independent central radiologists' (BICR) review. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression). Participants were evaluated every 9 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess their response to treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Over Survival(OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. In those instances where participants were confirmed to be alive on the visit cut-off date of 09 May 2016, survival was censored as of 09 May 2016.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>2yeas</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) and was assessed using RECIST 1.1 based on BICR evaluation.</description>
