  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the influence of genetic and clinical factors on the
      clinical outcomes of kidney transplant patients with tacrolimus (TAC) based immunosuppression
      in Taiwan.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus (TAC) is the most important immunosuppressants for maintenance therapy after
      kidney transplantation. Many genetic and clinical factors had been found to have effect on
      TAC pharmacokinetics (PK). Whether these factors affect clinical outcomes is still
      controversial.

      In this retrospective study, investigators will review records of kidney transplant patients
      with TAC based immunosuppression recruited from a previous study (IRB approval number:
      201512005RINC) to understand the influence of clinical and genetic factors on their 3-years
      clinical outcomes, including biopsy-proven acute rejection, patient survival, graft survival
      and safety issues of kidney transplant patients.

Post-transplant diabetes mellitus: identified by diagnosis and the use of antihyperglycemic agents, with follow-up of hemoglobin A1c in percentage and blood glucose in mg/dL.</description>
