  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower back pain (LBP) during pregnancy is a frequent syndrome: it concerns two thirds of
      pregnant women. This complaint isn't routinely searched for and therefore underdiagnosed.
      Furthermore, few solutions are given to these women in order to reduce their pain, and
      indirectly to improve everyday life. What's more, LBP is the cause of many work
      interruptions. Physical exercise during pregnancy is recommended by the National College of
      Gynaecologists and Obstetricians for low risk pregnancies. Several techniques have proven to
      be efficient.

      The main objective of our study is to assess the benefit of regular practice of standardised
      Stretching Postural® postures in patients presenting &quot;de novo&quot; lower back pain during
      pregnancy.

      The Stretching Postural® technique comprises of static postures involving muscular
      contractions and stretches. This allows the strengthening of the postural muscles, including
      the paravertebral muscles. After a short learning period, postures can be done autonomously
      by the patients. The postures are adaptable to each and everyone's morphology and physical
      limitations.

      Our study is an open, prospective, randomised monocentric superiority trial in parallel
      branches involving major patients during low risk pregnancies. These women suffer from &quot;de
      novo&quot; lower back pain during the second and third trimesters of their pregnancies. Each
      patient will be randomly assigned to one of the following 2 groups:

        -  Stretching Postural® group (group A): usual prevention methods (ergonomic education) and
           Stretching Postural® postures.

        -  &quot;Control&quot; group (group B): usual prevention methods only.

      Patients presenting &quot;de novo&quot; LBP are included in the study after a routine consult then
      randomly separated into two groups. During the initial consult, the physician assesses
      inclusion and judgement criteria, collects informed consent from the patients and teaches
      them the usual prevention methods as well as, concerning group A, Stretching Postural®
      postures. Computerized support agendas are given in order to improve observance.

      Patients are evaluated at day 0 (initial evaluation), after 4 weeks (intermediate) and after
      8 weeks (final), according to the main judgment criterion, as well as on secondary pain
      criteria by the Concise Pain Questionnaire, on their quality of life, the rate of work
      interruptions and their satisfaction rate. Neonatal outcome is collected at birth.
      Intermediate phone interviews will allow psychological support and improve observance.
      Inclusion is scheduled to last 22 months; each subject will be followed during a period of 2
      months. The total duration of the study is 2 years.

      Expected results are a decrease in back pain and an improvement of the quality of life in
      group A. Decrease in pain scale, equivalent to overall pain during the last week between the
      two groups will be our main judgment criterion. In order to detect a difference of 1.5 pain
      scale points (on a scale from 1 to 10) with an alpha risk of 5%, 80% magnitude and a standard
      deviation of 2, 56 subjects are necessary; 28 in each group.

      Perspectives: This study will allow for a better diagnosis of lower back pain during
      pregnancy, and, consequently, for the implementation of routine means of care such as
      collective or private lessons in Stretching Postural® and the supply of personalised
      prevention documents.
