    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled in the study from China and randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms:diabetes diet+highland barley diet; or diabetes diet.

      Study treatment will continue for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy measure is the change in
      MAGE from continuous glucose monitoring system at 12 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods:
      a 1-week screening (period A), a 8-day run-in period (period B) and a 12-week treatment
      period (period C). Continuous glucose monitoring system will be used in baseline and
      endpoint.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects and safety of barley
      meal plus diabetes diet on blood glucose fluctuations in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM)
      using multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). , parallel test. About 80 patients with T1DM
      were enrolled in the preliminary trial. During the lead-in period, no interventions were
      given to the patient's diet from day 1 to day 4, and diabetes diet education and guidance
      were given from day 5 to day 8, depending on the patient's blood glucose and diet.
      Personalization of habits, weights, and activities, etc., establish a diabetes diet. At the
      end of the lead-in period, patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups according
      to the ratio of 1:1: Observation group: Diabetes diet + barley diet. (The barley meal group
      diet was formulated according to the diabetes diet, but each meal was replaced with 20g
      barley nutrition powder and other calories instead of part of the diet. In the control group:
      Diabetes diet; dietary treatment after randomization will continue for 12 weeks. From the
      induction period to the treatment period 6 days, treatment period 10-12 weeks
