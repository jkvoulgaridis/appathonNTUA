  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HAROMY trial is an interventional trial enrolling metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Current
      treatment of breast cancer uses clinical subtype information (e.g hormone receptor-postive
      (HR+)) to help guide treatment options. Breast cancer can also be characterized by molecular
      subtype, but it is not known if this information is helpful in determining treatment when
      breast cancer has become metastatic. HARMONY will give the treating physician of each
      participant the molecular subtype of the tumor based on PAM50 testing. The usefulness of this
      information will be determined through physician survey. Finding out the molecular subtype of
      each tumor also allows the investigators to determine if the molecular subtype is different
      from what is expected based on the clinical subtype. This study will help determine how new
      types of information about tumors can help choose treatments for MBC

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To determine if clinical:molecular subtypes differ from expected results 15% of time

        2. To determine if molecular information alters treatment plans, as perceived by treating
           physican through survey

      Subjects will be consented to the trial and archival tissue from primary tumor will be
      obtained. Stored tissue from metastatic sites will also be obtained. The physician will be
      asked what the preferred medications for next two lines of treatment. PAM50 testing to
      determine molecular subtype will be determined on primary and metastatic tissue. The
      molecular subtype results of the primary tissue will be returned to the physician, and the
      physician will again be asked the preferred medications for the next two lines of treatment.
      The number of times these medications change between the first and second surveys will be
      determined.

      Subjects active participation will only last as long as the consent process.

             cancer with known ER, PR, and HER2 status determined by the local laboratory on the
