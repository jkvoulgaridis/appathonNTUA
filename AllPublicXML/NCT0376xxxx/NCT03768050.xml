  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term frail chronic complex patient (CCP) is generally applied to subjects with
      heterogeneous conditions that may represent at least one of the following three traits: (i)
      the need for management by a number of specialists from different disciplines that often
      leads to high use of healthcare resources; (ii) fragility, which requires additional support
      either due to functional decline, social deficits and/or transient situations such as
      hospital discharge or, (iii) the need for highly specialised care with home technological
      support.

      The current protocol deals with the second category of patients, frail CCP, and addresses
      horizontal integration of community-based services. It is based in the city of Badalona (216K
      inhabitants), within the metropolitan area of Barcelona. Badalona Serveis Assistencials (BSA)
      is the service provider of integrated care services for this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess three types of specific groups of patients: (i) Early discharge group
      includes patients acutely admitted to the medical and/or surgical hospital wards and promptly
      discharged to receive home-based post-acute care and/or rehabilitation; (ii) Home-based Case
      Management group includes complex chronic patients or patients receiving long-term care by a
      case management nurse; and (iii) Geriatric residences group will include patients receiving
      acute support, post-acute or continued care for elderly people living in geriatric
      residences.

      It will be conducted by Badalona Serveis Assistencials (BSA), an integrated care service
      provider located in the city of Badalona (420K inhabitants) in the North-Eastern part of the
      Barcelona Metropolitan Area.

      The current study protocol aims to assess cost-effectiveness of the three types of
      interventions for frail patients, as well as to generate a roadmap for regional scalability
      of the service. The study design will consist of a prospective quasi-experimental
      case-control design wherein each intervention group will be compared with the corresponding
      usual care group (controls, 1:1 ratio), using propensity score matching. Age, sex, GMA
      (adjusted morbidity groups), socioeconomic status, number of hospitalisations during the
      previous year and polypharmacy will be used as matching variables.

    <description>Home-based case management group receives advanced nursing care meeting the health and social needs of patient and/or carer. It is carried out through a process of evaluation, planning&amp;coordination, facilitating the provision, monitoring and evaluation of the options and resources necessary for the resolution of the case. It is person-centred. The service also provides palliative care.
Home hospitalisation/early discharge dispenses medical and nursing care at home on a transient basis after hospitalisation when patients still need surveillance and assistance. It is done in the acute, subacute or post-acute phase. In the last phase the focus is on functional recovery.
The geriatric residences group is assisted by health care teams with expertise in geriatrics. They coordinate with primary care and health professionals of the residences to improve the attention. They are highly accessible, have high-resolutive capacity and can activate the resources of the healthcare network.</description>
