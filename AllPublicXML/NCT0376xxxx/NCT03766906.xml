  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After development of the Talk Stem Familia (TSF) smart-speaker application prototype, the
      study will evaluate the prototype's efficacy in a within-subjects pre-post design study. The
      sample will contain 50 parent-student/child dyads who will use the Alexa skill app for 6
      weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive an Echo Dot device enabled with the application prototype using a
      research Amazon account created for each dyad. The Echo Dot devices will be preconfigured by
      project staff onto research Amazon accounts. Parents will come to one of several orientation
      sessions to obtain their device and set-up instructions; staff will provide follow-up phone
      support as needed. Usage data will show how much the device is used by each dyad. To ensure
      exposure to TSF, parents will be asked to engage at least 3 times per week; project staff
      will prompt parents bi-weekly (via text, email, device notification, phone) during the 6-week
      intervention to encourage usage and provide needed technical support.
