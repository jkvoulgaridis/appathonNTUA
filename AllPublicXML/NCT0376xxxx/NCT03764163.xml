  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop CT scanning and image analysis techniques to
      help define and measure several key properties of the pulmonary system that cannot be
      obtained by other tests or exams.

      Specifically, the investigators are interested in understanding the difference between the
      normal aging process and the events that lead to emphysema. Additionally, the investigators
      are interested in understanding the earliest signs (lung inflammation) of the disease process
      leading to three lung diseases, which include emphysema, fibrosis and sarcoidosis; all of
      which are described as &quot;inflammatory lung diseases.&quot; The investigators will be using the data
      from this study to help define the normal values for the measured properties as well as
      deviation from normal values in smokers without defined lung disease and patients with
      inflammatory lung disease. The investigators believe that the analysis and scanning
      techniques being developed as part of this research will provide new and previously
      unavailable information on normal and diseased lungs so that ultimately the investigators can
      detect specific changes in the lungs due to a disease and measure any improvements in the
      anatomy and/or function of the pulmonary system after a patient has undergone treatment. This
      study involves research using X-Ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, which is similar to
      previous CT scanners but operates much faster and provides finer image detail.
