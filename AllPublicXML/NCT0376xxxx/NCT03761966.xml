      A mechanism by which obesity could influence the increase in obstetric complications as more
      weight is gained, apart from oxidative stress (3) would be the changes in the expression
      profile of T helper (Th) cells. Due to the increase rate of obesity among Mexican women, the
      aim was to determine if there is some association between the weight changes in pregnancy and
      the cytokines Interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor
      alpha (TNF-α).

      Pregnant women older than 18 years old were invited to participate and all were asked to sign
      the informed consent. Women with congenital heart disease, disabling diseases, infectious
      diseases and autoimmune diseases were excluded and those whose clinical follow-up was lost
      were discarded from the final analysis.

      Weight and height were measured using a calibrated using an adult scale (Seca, Hamburg,
      Germany). Blood Pressure (BP; mmHg) was checked by auscultation using a standard
      sphygmomanometer (Riester Big Ben® Square; Jangingen, Germany). All mothers received written
      nutritional guidance depending on the characteristics of each patient.

      The expression levels of IL-10, IL-4, IFN-γ and TNF-α was performed by the ELISA technique.

      Quantitative variables will be represented by measures of central tendency. Once the
      Kolmogorov test is performed for the normality of the variables, either the Student's T test
      or the Mann Whitney U test will be used to compare both groups. With the same criteria for
      normality either Pearson or Spearmen correlation will be used among the cytokines and
      anthropometric variables, considering a significant difference at p ≤ 0.05. The statistical
      analysis will be carried out in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
      program, version 19.
