  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic adults are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and 1.5 times more
      likely to die from the disease than non-Hispanic whites. These disparities are mediated, in
      part, by less healthful levels of physical activity, dietary quality, medication adherence,
      and self-monitoring of blood glucose than non-Hispanic whites. Innovative approaches that
      arise from affected communities are needed to address these health disparities.

      Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been successful in targeting health issues
      among Hispanic and immigrant populations; CBPR is an effective approach for addressing health
      behaviors in a sociocultural context. In 2004, the research team developed a CBPR partnership
      between immigrant communities and academic institutions called Rochester Healthy Community
      Partnership (RHCP)

      Storytelling or narrative-based interventions are designed to incorporate culture-centric
      health messaging to promote behavior change among vulnerable populations. Digital
      storytelling interventions are narrative-based videos elicited through a CBPR approach to
      surface the authentic voices of individuals overcoming obstacles toward engaging in health
      promoting behaviors to shape positive health behaviors of viewers through influences on
      attitudes and beliefs.

      RHCP partners from Hispanic communities identified T2D as a priority area for intervention,
      and have co-created each of the formative phases leading up to this proposal. Narrative
      theory and social cognitive theory formed the conceptual basis for intervention development.
      The study team conducted surveys and focus groups to derive the approach and personnel for
      building an authentic intervention that was created in a digital storytelling workshop where
      stories about diabetes self-management were captured, recorded, and edited to derive the
      final intervention products in video forma. The respective digital storytelling videos were
      pilot tested with 25 patients across healthcare institutions in Minnesota and Arizona. The
      intervention was rated as highly acceptable, culturally relevant, and perceived as
      efficacious for motivating behavioral change.

      The overall objective of this project is therefore to assess the efficacy of a digital
      storytelling intervention derived through a CBPR approach on self-management of T2D among
      Hispanic adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will conduct a two-group randomized controlled trial in primary care clinical
      settings at two healthcare institutions among 450 Hispanic adults with poorly controlled T2D
      (hemoglobin A1c≥8%). The intervention group will view the 12-minute digital storytelling
      video. Both the intervention and comparison groups will receive diabetes education and
      resource cards, as well as usual clinical care. The primary outcome will be glycemic control
      as measured by hemoglobin A1c 3 months after intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes will
      include diabetes self-management behaviors, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, and body mass
      index. The impact of concomitant covariates, including sex, age, and socio-economic status,
      on the sensitivity of the intervention effect will also be explored.

    <measure>Glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c. Hemoglobin A1c will be measured from whole blood samples obtained and analyzed in a blinded fashion.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The rationale for use of hemoglobin A1c as an indicator of diabetes control is based on national and regional data that demonstrate significant disparities in reaching hemoglobin A1c targets for Hispanic populations compared with non-Hispanic whites. The importance of glycemic control as part of the comprehensive management of diabetes is well documented, and hemoglobin A1c testing is a well-established strategy to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes self-management behaviors will be assessed with the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure (SDSCA).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a brief survey instrument to assess the following domains: general diet, specific (diabetes) diet, physical activity, diabetes medication use, and blood glucose monitoring. In a 2009 review of psychometric tools to assess diabetes self-management behaviors, the SDSCA was one of only three instruments to meet all appraisal criteria113. The SDSCA is also the most commonly used instrument for these domains worldwide, with good validity evidence in several languages, including Spanish114,115. Furthermore, we used this instrument with Hispanic/Latino patients during the early phase (Step 1) for this project22. The SDSCA will be administered by the same language-congruent study staff at each measure.</description>

    <description>Baseline LDL-cholesterol values will be drawn at the baseline study visit. Cholesterol values at 3 months will be drawn at the 3 month study visit. Subsequent cholesterol levels will not be drawn or abstracted.</description>
