  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a common eye disease that affects 1 to 2 out of 10 persons around the
      planet. One common cause of this disease is the meibomian gland dysfunction. Meibomian glands
      are very small glands located at the rim of the eyelids that produce an oily substance that
      prevents the evaporation of tears. When these glands are compromised, the tear film
      evaporates quickly and the eyes dry up. This disease presents as eye irritation, foreign body
      sensation, inflammation, etc. The treatment of choice for MGD is eyelid massage and warm
      compresses 2 times a day. However, these treatments not always work perfectly, and as a
      result, patients find it hard to follow doctor's orders. Another kind of treatment is thermal
      therapy. There are several devices that are designed to apply heat on the eyelids, such as
      Lipiflow, MiBo Thermoflo, and Blephasteam. In this study, we want to find out whether thermal
      therapy with MiBo Thermoflo works better than warm compresses and eyelid massage use in the
      treatment of dry eye caused by MGD. To do this, we will select several patients and will
      assign them randomly to either the group with thermal therapy with MiBo Thermoflo or to the
      group with warm compresses and eyelid massage. The Mibo group will receive 3 sessions of
      thermal therapy at 2 weeks interval and the control group warm compresses and eyelid massage
      2 times per day. All subjects will have a follow up of 24 weeks and we will compare results
      for both groups at the end of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is considered one of the most important ophthalmologic diseases, affecting
      10 to 20% of the general population. Of these, 3.7% to 70% of cases are due to meibomian
      gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is a chronic diffuse disease characterized by terminal duct
      obstruction and/or qualitative/quantitative changes in gland secretion. This causes a
      disruption in the tear film, ocular irritation symptom, inflammation, and ocular surface
      symptoms. The gold standard for the treatment of meibomian dysfunction is the use of warm
      compresses and eyelid massage 2 times a day. These have variable results and consequently
      patient's adherence to treatment is low. An alternative treatment is the use of thermal
      therapy devices such as Lipiflow, MiBo Thermoflo, and Blephasteam. The objective of this
      study is to determine if the thermal device MiBo Thermoflo is more effective than warm
      compresses and eyelid massage in the treatment of dry eye secondary to MGD. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Mibo group will receive 3 sessions of thermal
      therapy at 2 weeks interval and the control group warm compresses and eyelid massage 2 times
      per day. All subjects will have follow up of 24 weeks and we will compare results for both
      groups at the end of the study. During the protocol patients in both groups will continue
      with their standard treatment for dry eye as needed.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will be ophthalmologically evaluated before treatment and at weeks 8, 16 and 24. Subjects will be randomly assigned into 2 study groups. Mibo group will have 3 sessions (basal, week 2, week 4) of thermal therapy with Mibo Thermoflo in both eyes. The control group will use warm compresses and eyelid massage 2 times per day in both eyes. At the week 16 control group will also have 3 sessions of Mibo therapy at 2 weeks interval.</intervention_model_description>
