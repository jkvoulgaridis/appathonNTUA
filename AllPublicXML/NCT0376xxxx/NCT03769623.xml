    <textblock>
      The study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, blind, parallel positive control, and
      superiority test study, 206 subjects with small coronary artery disease who met the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled, subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment
      group of Biolimus and Powerline at 1:1. All subjects underwent clinical follow-up at 30 days,
      6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after surgery, and angiographic follow-up at 9 months. The
      primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 9 months.

      The study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, blind, parallel positive control, and
      superiority test study, 206 subjects with small coronary artery disease who met the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled, subjects were randomly assigned to the treatment
      group of Biolimus and Powerline at 1:1. All subjects underwent clinical follow-up at 30 days,
      6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after surgery, and angiographic follow-up at 9 months. The
      primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 9 months.

      The study will enroll 206 subjects. The sample size determination process is as follows:

      According to the primary endpoint- the sample size was calculated for late lumen loss (LLL)
      in lesion segments 9 months after surgery. After literature review, according to a
      meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled studies, in the control group (POBA), the level of
      late lumen loss after treatment of small vessel lesions was 0.54mm, another meta-analysis
      showed that LLL after PTCA was 0.57±0.57mm. According to the literature and clinical
      practice, clinical researchers and statisticians assumed that the level of LLL in the
      experimental group of this study (DCB) could be reduced to 0.32mm after treatment, and the
      standard deviation of the combined LLL in the two groups was conservatively estimated to be
      0.50mm. The sample size calculation formula of parallel design and superiority test was used,
      When significant level α is taken as 0.025 on one side, power (1-β) is taken as 80%, and the
      superiority boundary value is 0, random allocation is carried out according to the ratio of
      1:1, and the required sample size of each group is calculated as 82 cases，taking into account
      the maximum 20% failure rate of angiographic follow-up (as well as other causes of early exit
      and randomization destruction, etc.), the total sample size of the two groups was 206 cases,
      including 103 cases in the experimental group (DCB) and 103 cases in the control group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with stable angina, unstable angina, or old myocardial infarction or
             asymptomatic ischemia with objective evidence;

          2. Age ≥18 years and ≤ 75 years;

          3. Subjects had no contraindication of coronary artery revascularization (PCI or CABG);

          4. The subjects voluntarily participated in and agreed to sign the informed consent form,
             and voluntarily received angiographic follow-up at 9 months after surgery and clinical

             different coronary arteries, the number of target lesions on each coronary artery
             should not exceed one (In the case of 2 vascular lesions, a maximum of 2 target
             lesions are allowed);

          2. Visual reference diameter of the vessel is 2.0 mm-2.75 mm;

          3. Non-target vessel lesions should be treated with interventional therapy first
             (concurrent treatment is required), and then random and target lesions should be
             treated after successful treatment;

          4. Preoperative diameter stenosis must be greater than 70% or 50% and be accompanied by
             ischemia corresponding to the target vessel (visual measurement);

          5. Patients in the experimental group and the control group were treated with only one
             research device (Biolimus) or a control device (Powerline) for each target lesion.
