    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to identify the assistance effect of Ankle Assist Robot v1
      developed by Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., Korea)
      by comparing

        1. gait function during overground gait in three conditions (with robot-assist torque
           on/with robot-assist torque off/without robot)

        2. the energy expenditure during treadmill gait in three conditions (with robot-assist
           torque on/with robot-assist torque off/without robot)
