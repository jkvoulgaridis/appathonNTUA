  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to depict the myocardial tissue characteristics in STEMI
      patients by CMR and other cardiac imaging modalities and to assess the prognostic value of
      imaging-derived indices. Information will be collected prospectively in about 1000 STEMI
      patients in 10 sites. Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of STEMI
      patients that undergo CMR examination. Information of other cardiac imagings and clinical
      outcomes are also prospectively collected in the database. This project will establish a
      prospective registry of 1000 STEMI patients in 10 sites with follow-ups of up to 5 years.

      The aim of the project will be as following:

        1. To investigate myocardial tissue features and functional changes in STEMI patients.

        2. To identify CMR-derived indices that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

        3. To compare CMR with other alternative cardiac imaging modalities (i.e., echocardiography
           or SPECT) on prognostic prediction in STEMI patients.

        4. To compare myocardial tissue characteristics and functional changes in STEMI and NSTEMI
           patients (data derived from EARLY-MYO-CMR II Registry).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        STEMI patients who have had CMR imaging performed and have provided written consent.

          1. Patents older than 18 years old with myocardial infarction diagnosed by:

               1. typical ischemic symptom,

               2. New ischaemic ECG changes;: ≥2 mm ST-segment elevation in 2 contiguous precordial
                  leads or ≥1 mm ST-segment elevation in 2 contiguous extremity leads ;

               3. elevated cardiac troponin value with at least one value above 99th percentile
                  upper reference limit(UPL);

               4. confirmed by coronary angiography (CAG) or imaging evidence of new loss of viable
                  myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with
                  an ischaemic aetiology.

          2. Patients who have had CMR imaging performed and have agreed to comply with the follow
             up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who is unable to comply with the follow-up schedule.

          2. Patient who has any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigators will
             not be appropriate to participate in the study.

          3. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months due to any condition.
