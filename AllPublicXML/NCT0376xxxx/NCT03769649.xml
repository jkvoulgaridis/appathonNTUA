    <textblock>
      This prospective study is intended to evaluate the CelluTite RFAL handpiece combined with
      Morpheus8 handpiece for the treatment of cellulite.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cellulite treatment using two hand pieces:

        -  The CelluTite - based on a minimally invasive, temperature-controlled
           Radiofrequency-assisted lipolysis (RFAL) technology. RF energy is applied using a
           handpiece with 2 electrodes: internal active electrode with spatula-shaped tip and
           external electrode.

        -  The Morpheus8 - designed to deliver RF energy to the skin surface in a fractional manner
           via an array of 24-electrode pins.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in cellulite score rated according to Cellulite severity scale at follow- up visits comparing to baseline score.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Photos from all time points (baseline and follow-up visits) will be evaluated by the treating physician and 2 independent evaluators.
Evaluation goals are rating the degree of cellulite according to the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS). This 5-point photonumeric scale rates cellulite severity from a score &quot;0&quot; (none) to &quot;4&quot; (severe) from a clinician's perspective in two main clinical morphologic features of cellulite (categories): (A) number of evident dimples; and (B) severity of linear undulations. Cellulite score is a given based on a combination of the two characteristics: number of dimples and severity of modulations. Score reduction at follow-up visit comparing to baseline indicates that treatment is effective.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of adverse events will be assessed based on frequency, severity and causality data.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by observation, assessment and recording of adverse events, if occur. Evaluations will be done immediately after treatments and at all follow-up visits. Each occurrence will be described in a table presenting data including severity (mild, moderate or severe), causality (relationship to the device or the treatment), treatment and resolution. Data will be summarized and adverse event significance will be considered based on combination of the above listed items.</description>
