  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and purpose. Even if periprocedural cerebral microembolism associated with carotid
      endarterectomy or stenting usually does not manifest as clinically overt stroke,
      neuropsychological disturbances resulting from these events represent an important clinical
      and socioeconomic problem. Still, it remains unclear whether the use proximal protection can
      lower the incidence of cerebral embolism associated with the treatment of carotid stenosis.

      Materials and methods. This was a prospective randomised single-centre study, which was aimed
      at comparison of surgical eversion endarterectomy with stenting under proximal protection in
      symptomatic patients. The investigators evaluated the incidence of new ischaemic lesions
      revealed by the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 2-4 days after the treatment
      and neurologic events.

      The CARECarotid was a prospective randomised single-centre study, which was performed in the
      University Hospital in Kraków. It was planned to evaluate 50 patients presenting with
      symptomatic lesions of the internal carotid artery.

      Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms: surgical endarterectomy or
      carotid angioplasty with stenting under proximal protection. All patients provided their
      written informed consent to undergo the procedures and to participate in this trial.

      In all surgical patients carotid endarterectomy will perform using the eversion technique.
      All surgical endarterectomies will perform under cervical block anaesthesia.

      Perioperatively patients in the surgical arm received aspirin; other antiplatelet or
      anticoagulant agents were not administered during 5 days before surgery.

      All procedures in carotid artery stenting will perform with proximal protection system - the
      Mo.Ma (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) device. The investigators will implante stents that
      were tailored to the localisation of lesions and morphology of carotid arteries: Carotid
      Wallstent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA, and in patients with tortuous arteries Precise
      Pro RX (Cordis, Fremont, CA, USA) or Roadsaver (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Patients in the stent
      arm will receive clopidogrel 75 mg/day and aspirin 75 mg/day. These drugs were administered
      during 3 days before planned procedure and then 3-6 months after stent implantation. All
      patients will have MRI DWI performed before and 2-4 days after procedures in both groups.
      Within 6 months there will be an evaluation of the incidence of neurological events.
