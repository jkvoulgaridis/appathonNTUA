  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a fitness- and behavioral-focused
      intervention, Athletes for Life (AFL), to improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) among 160
      underserved families.

    <textblock>
      The Athletes for Life (AFL) study was a 12-week randomized controlled trial designed to
      promote cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and healthy lifestyle changes among parents and
      children. The original enrollment target was 160 families. A total of 149 parent-child dyads
      living in a Southwestern U.S. metropolitan area were enrolled in the study. AFL consisting of
      24 structured, twice-weekly 90-min family-based, nutrition and sport/fitness-oriented
      sessions, and was delivered in a municipal recreation center. Behavior change, including
      increased physical activity, and adherence were motivated through positive reinforcement
      techniques. Families were randomized to either the AFL program or a wait-list control group.

    <intervention_model_description>Families (i.e., children and parents/primary caregivers dyads) were randomly assigned to participate in either the intervention group or a wait-list control group. The intervention (AFL) consisted of 24 structured, twice-weekly 90-min family-based, nutrition and sport/fitness-oriented sessions, and was delivered in a municipal recreation center. The wait-list control group received the intervention after all follow-up data had been collected. Data from all participants (both intervention group and wait-list group) were collected in four phases: before the intervention group started the program (week 0) and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks, thereafter.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The AFL intervention consisted of two 90-minute sessions per week for 12 months for both children and parents. The child physical activity sessions, held separately from the parent sessions, aimed to achieve 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during each session through structured play activities, athletic drills, and sport exercises. Child dietary behaviors were taught through educational activities in small groups. For the parent program, behavior modification techniques were used to guide parents toward changing their own and their child's behavior. Take-home materials for self-monitoring of behaviors were used for both the child and the parent in order to reinforce concepts discussed in class.</description>

    <description>Families that were randomly assigned to the wait-list control group were asked not to change their normal physical activity or dietary behaviors for the duration of the 12-week waiting period. They were asked to participate in the baseline and 12-week evaluations and then they were enrolled to receive the 12-week intervention.</description>
