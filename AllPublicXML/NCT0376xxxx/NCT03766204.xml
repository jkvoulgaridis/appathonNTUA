    <textblock>
      Efforts to identify circulating factors that predict severity of acute lung injury/acute
      respiratory distress syndrome（ALI/ARDS）patients is unrevealing. The primary purpose of this
      study is to verify circRNAs and microRNAs might be potential novel ALI/ARDS biomarkers and
      could play roles in pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS.

    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating cause
      of morbidity and mortality characterized by alveolar epithelial and endothelial injury.
      Despite recent advances in pathogenetic mechanisms and therapy strategies of ALI, efforts to
      identify circulating factors that predict severity of ALI/ARDS patients have been
      unrevealing.

      Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous non-coding RNA with a covalently
      continuous closed-loop structure. Compared with traditional linear RNAs, circRNAs are more
      stable and resistant to RNase R due to the absence of 5' caps and 3' tails, which show clear
      advantages in acting as novel molecular biomarkers for many diseases. In addition, many
      studies have reported that circRNAs can bind to microRNAs (miRNAs), acting as &quot;miRNA sponges&quot;
      which are named competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), and can regulate gene expression at the
      transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Evidence indicates that circRNAs play
      important roles in cancers and other diseases such as tuberculosis and intervertebral disc
      degeneration. As no published research has studied the expression and role of circRNAs in the
      pathology and pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, the investigators aimed to validate the aberrant
      expression of circRNAs in ALI/ARDS and explore the potential pathological mechanism in which
      circRNAs are involved.

        Patients with and without ARDS were screened from Changhai Hospital. Patients were enrolled
        consecutively over a 2-year time period (2017-2018). All enrolled patients with ALI met the
        American-European Consensus Committee criteria.In addition, healthy individuals were
        recruited from the general population.
