  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 15-week, outpatient study of remote observed dosing to improve suboxone compliance
      in opiate dependent subjects.The main purpose of this study is to see if watching patients
      take their medication will improve treatment of opiate dependence by prompting patients to
      take all prescribed doses of Suboxone. Suboxone is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opiate dependence. All patients receive a
      smartphone and patients in the intervention (remote observed dosing) group will use the
      smartphone to take videos of themselves taking Suboxone.
