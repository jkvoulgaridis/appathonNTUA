  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduction in hand functionality and finger dexterity are significant, but often overlooked,
      symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). They are strictly correlated with loss of patient's
      autonomy, due to their significant impact on Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and,
      consequently in patient's Quality of life (QoL). No studies investigated the effectiveness of
      a specific and functional-based Occupational Therapy (OT) treatment in improving hand
      functionality and finger dexterity in PD patients.

      Aims of tthe study are to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific OT treatment aimed to
      enhance finger and hand dexterity and its impact on daily living autonomy of PD patients.

      Retrospectively, 482 PD patients, hospitalized for a 4-week Multidisciplinary Intensive
      Rehabilitation Treatment (MIRT) between January 2015 and January 2018 were identified. All
      patients underwent 1h/day OT treatment. The outcome measure was the O'Connor finger dexterity
      test; secondary outcome measures were Minnesota dexterity test, UPDRS II and SPDDS scale.
      These measures were assessed at admission (T0) and discharge (T1).
