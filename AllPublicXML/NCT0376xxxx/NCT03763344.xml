  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perceptual-cognitive training (PCT) is a computerized software game has been shown to improve
      sport performance in young elite athletes and even to aid in recovery speeds post-concussion.
      PCT may represent a unique type of training that could ultimately enhance cognitive
      performance or quality of life in all populations. What is not clear is whether PCT is
      beneficial to older adults with subjective memory complaints (SMCs). SMCs in older adults are
      an early risk indicator for Alzheimer's disease, making older adults with SMCs a target
      population for proactive interventions. The aim of this study was to determine if PCT can
      serve as a proactive intervention and enhance cognitive abilities in older adults with SMCs.
      The results of this research protocol introduce a new way of prevention from cognitive
      decline in healthy older adults and may introduce a new training programs for age-related
      memory disorder.

      This study was approved by the University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board (Protocol
      Number 17-167) and all participants provided their informed written consent prior to
      participating in this study. In order to reduce the placebo effect, the participants were
      randomly divided into the experimental and control groups. Participants from both the
      experimental and control groups received a total of three neuropsychological assessments over
      a three month period (i.e. baseline, 7 weeks, 11 weeks). Considering that an essential
      methodological component of the training studies is the use of standardized
      neuropsychological tests, validated and reliable measures such as STROOP TEST, DIGIT SPAN
      BACKWARD TEST, TRAIL MAKING TEST, VERBAL FLUENCY TESTS, CALIFORNIA VERBAL LEARNING TEST
      Second Edition (i.e., standard and alternate forms), were used at different time points. Each
      assessment was 50-60 minutes in duration and was administered by an expert neuropsychology
      resident. The first assessment was administered at baseline . Then, the experimental group
      underwent seven weeks of perceptual cognitive training, while the control group completed
      seven weeks without formal training. The treatment for the PCT group consisted of 14 sessions
      of training each lasting 25-30 min, twice per week for seven weeks. After the seven-week time
      period, a second neuropsychological assessment was performed on both groups. After eleven
      weeks, a follow-up assessment was conducted to verify whether the benefits of cognitive
      training endure over time.

    <description>Perceptual Cognitive Training (PCT) will be performed by having individuals work with a visual perceptual training software program called NeuroTracker. This device uses Multiple Object Tracking at increasing difficulties to develop high-level brain functions critical to recovery &amp; cognitive health. By increasing in difficulty with each correct response and decreasing in difficulty when mistakes are made, brain function is constantly challenged. Each session (6 mins) delivers a series of mini-tests where the patient needs to remember key targets, then track them moving among distractors for several seconds and then identify them. Simple to do, but always challenging, NeuroTracker adaptively optimizes difficulty to each patient's level, maximizing cognitive stimulation every step of the way.</description>
