  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging adults (EA; 18 to 29 years old) in Canada are among the age group with highest risk
      of developing mental health issues. Despite this, they experience especially long wait-times
      for mental health services. To date, there has been minimal research into developmentally
      appropriate treatment options for the EA population. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs)
      are emerging as a potential treatment to address this need. MBIs are group-based
      psychological treatments for coping with distress, with the goal of improving mental health.
      Unfortunately, these 'traditional' MBIs are very demanding in terms of time and homework and
      are therefore not sufficiently feasible for the demanding schedules of EA university
      students. Instead, recent studies suggest a role for briefer MBIs in addressing mental health
      symptom burden, well-being and reducing acute stress symptoms. The brevity of these
      interventions make them theoretically better suited for EA university populations. High
      quality research, including controlled clinical trials are needed to demonstrate whether MBIs
      can provide efficacious treatment to improve the lives of EA university students. The current
      study will test the efficacy of a five-week MBI baseline within-subject controlled trial.
