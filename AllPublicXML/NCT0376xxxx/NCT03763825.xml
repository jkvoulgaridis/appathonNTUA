  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People treated for breast cancer often live with an ongoing fear that the cancer will recur.
      This fear may develop and impact on their mental health and quality of life. The Mini-AFTERc
      study is a pilot trial of a brief cognitive behavioural communication intervention, designed
      to reduce fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in breast cancer patients. This pilot trial aims to
      determine the acceptability and practicality of introducing the Mini-AFTERc intervention into
      everyday practice, and inform the development of a full randomised controlled trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot trial are as follows:

        1. To develop a procedure for training breast cancer nurses (BCN) in the delivery of the
           Mini-AFTERc intervention and introduce the intervention into current NHS service
           provision for breast cancer patients.

        2. To collect data to pilot and test recruitment (of breast cancer nurses and breast cancer
           patients), the fidelity of intervention elements, the acceptability to participants
           (primary and secondary outcomes) and detailed economic indicators for a full trial.

        3. Apply a formal decision making framework (ADePT) to determine a profile of factors to
           reveal potential difficulties and appraise solutions prior to a full trial.

      This study is a multicentre controlled pilot trial of the Mini-AFTERc intervention and will
      take place in 4 breast cancer centres in NHS Scotland health boards, including Fife,
      Highlands, Lothian and Tayside. Two centres will deliver the intervention (Fife and Lothian)
      and 2 centres will deliver usual care to patients, acting as control centres (Highlands and
      Tayside). The project will be delivered in 3 phases:

      Phase 1 will include the development and delivery of the Mini-AFTERc intervention training
      package for breast cancer nurses.

      Phase 2 will include patient recruitment and data collection. There will be 2 intervention
      centres and 2 control centres across NHS Scotland. Patients who have completed their primary
      breast cancer treatment, will be screened for moderate FCR (scoring ≥10 and &lt;15 on the Fear
      of Cancer Recurrence 4-item Scale; FCR4). Breast cancer nurses will deliver the intervention
      by telephone in intervention centres, which will be audio recorded. Patients will complete a
      satisfaction questionnaire after the intervention (CARE and MISS). Follow-up questionnaires
      measuring fear of cancer recurrence, anxiety and depression and quality of life outcomes
      (FCR4, HADS, EQ-5D) will be delivered via a smartphone app at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months
      following intervention or 3 weeks, 5 weeks and 13 weeks following screening for the control
      group. Semi-structured interviews with 20% of patients and all nurses will be conducted to
      assess experiences and acceptability of the intervention.

      Phase 3 will conduct data analysis and trial evaluation. Screening and follow-up data will be
      quantitatively analysed, including structured equation modelling. Interviews will be subject
      to framework analysis based on normalisation process theory (NPT). The pilot trial will be
      systematically evaluated using a process of decision making after pilot and feasibility
      trials (ADePT).

      The findings will help to understand if this brief intervention can be implemented in
      everyday practice and can reduce FCR. They will also inform the practicality of
      implementation of a larger-scale randomised trial.

    <measure>Patient satisfaction with nurse communication during the Mini-AFTERc intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure, validated for use in secondary care (Mercer et al. 2004). The CARE measure asks patient to rate their nurses' communication skills on 10 communication and empathy domains (e.g. 'How was your nurse at fully understanding your concerns?'). Patients rate nurses from 1 ('Poor') to 5 ('Excellent') for each of the 10 domains.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of cancer recurrence level - FCR4</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FCR4 is a 4-item measure designed to assess patient anxiety, worry and strong feelings associated with the return of cancer (e.g. 'I am afraid that my cancer may recur'). The research group has validated the FCR4 as an accurate measure of cancer recurrence fears in breast cancer patients that is fit for routine use in clinical services (Humphris, Watson, Sharpe, &amp; Ozakinci, 2018). Each question in the FCR4 is rated by the patient on a scale of 1 ('Not at all') to 5 ('All the time'). A cumulative score of ≥10 (60 Percentile) across all 4 items is defined as 'moderate' fear of cancer recurrence and a cumulative score of ≥15 is defined as 'high' fear of cancer recurrence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression and anxiety symptoms - Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item assessment tool used to screen for anxiety and depression the general medical population (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983). The HADS is well established tool and has been employed in a multitude of medical settings, including oncology, to assess patients' mental health (Hartung et al., 2017; Vodermaier &amp; Millman, 2011). The HADS assesses two domains, depressionand anxiety. Patients report symptoms of depression and anxiety in the last week on a 4-point Likert scale, from 0 (e.g. &quot;Not at all&quot;) to 3 (e.g. &quot;Most of the time&quot;).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life - EuroQol 5 Dimension Measure of Quality of Life (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardised instrument of health-related quality of life, developed by the EuroQol Group (Herdman et al., 2011). The EQ-5D assesses 5 dimensions including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D contains 6-items, 5 of these items assess each of the 5 dimensions and are rated on a 5-level (5L) scale. The final item is a measure of health state, which is rated on a scale of 0 ('worst imaginable health state') to 100 (Best imaginable health state').</description>

    <time_frame>Within 1 month of delivering final intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interviews with patients will explain and evaluate the underlying mechanisms of implementing the Mini-AFTERc intervention into routine cancer care from the perspective of breast cancer nurses. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) will provide a theory-driven framework for addressing this outcome. NPT aims to provide coherence, as well as assessments of cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive monitoring (Murray et al. 2010).</description>
