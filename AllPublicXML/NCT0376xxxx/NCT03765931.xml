      Abstract: Background The current practice in Senegal is to use broad-spectrum antibiotics
      including amoxicillin and/or cotrimoxazole in case of non-malarial fevers. First-line
      treatment with doxycycline has cured such patients. The investgators aimed to determine the
      efficacy of a single dose of doxycycline compared to a 5-day amoxicillin course for the
      treatment of fever.

      Methods The investgators conducted a non-inferiority, open-label, randomized controlled trial
      in patients aged &gt; 8 years recruited from dispensaries in the rural area of Niakhar, Senegal.
      Participants were enrolled based on a body temperature &gt; 37.5°C, as assessed using an
      electronic axillary thermometer. Febrile patients with a positive malaria test were excluded
      from the study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of
      doxycycline (30 mg/kg) or a five-day course of amoxicillin (20 mg/kg) by a computer-generated
      random number sequence. The investgators monitored participants at days 2 and 7
      post-treatment. The primary outcome was cure after 7 days, defined as a body temperature &lt;
      37.5°C. The investgators used a non-inferiority margin of 10%. This trial was approved by the
      national ethic committees of the Senegalese Ministry of Health in May 2017
      (0026/MSAS/DPRS/CNERS, March, 7, 2016).
