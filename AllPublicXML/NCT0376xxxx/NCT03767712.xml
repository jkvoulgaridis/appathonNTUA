  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyse the immunological reaction to Trauma (pertrochanteric femoral fracture with
      consequent osteosynthesis) in the first weeks up to one year postoperatively with focus on
      the development of autoimmunity.

      This project represents a unique study of the influence of trauma on the immune system. It
      addresses the question whether an excess of apoptotic/necrotic cells can induce an at least
      transient autoimmune phenomena in humans. If the hypothesis of a transient induction of
      autoimmunity by trauma proves to be correct, this study will provide a novel insight into the
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
