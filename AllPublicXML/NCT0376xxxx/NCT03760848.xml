    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, 2-period, single-sequence assessment of CYP3A4 inhibition by
      aramchol using the probe substrates midazolam and atorvastatin to assess CYP3A4 activity.

    <textblock>
      Enrolment of 16 subjects is planned. Each subject will take part in 2 study periods.

      In Period 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam on Day 1 and a single
      oral dose of 40 mg atorvastatin on Day 3.

      In Period 2, subjects will receive twice-daily oral doses of 300 mg aramchol (the IMP) for 18
      days. During aramchol dosing, subjects will take a single dose of 2 mg midazolam in the
      morning on Day 10 and 40 mg atorvastatin in the morning on Day 12.

      Subjects will be screened within 21 days before their first dose of study medicine. In Period
      1, they will remain resident on the ward from Day -1 to Day 10. In Period 2, subjects will be
      admitted on Day -1 and discharged on Day 19. Subjects will attend a follow-up visit
      approximately 2 weeks later, on Day 33 (±2 days). There will be an interval of at least 1 day
      between Periods 1 and 2.

             (paracetamol), during the 7 days before the first dose of trial medication.

         13. Receipt of an investigational product (including prescription medicines) as part of
             another clinical trial within the 3 months before first admission to this study; in

             study.

         14. Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or intake of more than 14 units of
             alcohol weekly.

             45_90 beats/min, unless judged not clinically significant.

         16. Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

         17. Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing.
