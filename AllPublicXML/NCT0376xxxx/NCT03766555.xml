      We propose a randomized controlled study to compare the treatment efficacy of microwave
      ablation to liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with borderline
      liver function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer and is diagnosed at an earlier stage and
      with increasing frequency because of the wider implementation of screening programs. Whether
      liver resection or local ablation should be the first-line treatment in early HCC remains a
      hot topic for debate. Both are regarded as acceptable curative treatment for early HCC in
      many international guidelines. Underlying liver function is the key in treatment selection.
      The general consensus is that liver resection should be the treatment of choice in patients
      with good liver function while local ablation should be considered in patients with poor
      liver function. There exists a group of patients with apparently good liver function that
      harbor significant liver cirrhosis which is not easily picked up by the current assessment or
      scoring systems. Liver resection in this group of patients is burdened by potentially
      life-threatening complications and the overall survival is limited by their underlying liver
      cirrhosis. This is particularly important in early HCC as local ablation is another curative
      treatment option. In order to improve the prognosis of patients with early HCC, it is
      important to identify (1) patients with liver dysfunction to the extend that the risk of
      liver resection will outweigh the survival benefit it provides; (2) the best ablative method
      for HCC.

      The investigators propose to carry out a prospective randomized controlled study to compare
      the treatment outcome of microwave ablation with liver resection in patients with borderline
      liver function whose HCC that are amendable to both liver resection and microwave ablation.

    <description>Microwave ablation will be performed in operation theatre under general anesthesia via laparoscopic or open approach according to the tumors' locations. In case of open approach, it will be done via a right subcostal incision with possible upper midline extension was necessary. After diagnostic laparoscopy in laparoscopic approach and exploratory laparotomy in open approach to exclude the presence of extra-hepatic disease, operative ultrasound (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) will be performed to exclude preoperatively undetected lesion; guide insertion of the microwave applicator; and monitor the whole ablation process. Surrounding organs were cooled by constant irrigation of ice-cold saline to prevent thermal injury. The ablation will be carried out according to the standard protocol with the aim to create a 1cm ablation margin around the tumor. The insertion track will be burnt after ablation in order to prevent bleeding and tumor seeding.</description>

    <description>Liver resection will be performed as described previously. Liver parenchymal transection would be performed with CUSA (cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator) and TissueLink (a radiofrequency saline-linked dissecting sealer) in both arms. Vascular staplers would be used to divide major vascular pedicles. Fibrin glue (Tisseel) spray would be applied to the parenchymal cut surface of the liver before closure of abdomen.</description>
