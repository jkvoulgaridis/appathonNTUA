  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that seeks to examine the effectiveness of Eyeprotx™
      protective goggles in comparison to traditional methods against ocular injury that can occur
      perioperatively under general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular injury is but a devastating condition that can occur perioperatively under general
      anesthesia. Corneal abrasion is the most common ocular injury during general anesthesia,
      surpassing case incidence of damage caused by patient movement in ophthalmologic surgery.
      Causes of ocular injury include corneal drying due to the suppression of tear ducts from
      anesthetic agents, direct physical trauma, or agitation from the volatile anesthetic used.
      Ocular injury may also occur due to bacterial infection with MRSA, preventative methods, or
      rubbing of the eyes postoperatively due to agitation. Agitation may be caused by corneal
      drying or by shift or disruption in rapid eye movement sleep cycle from light penetration
      through the eyelids. Attempts at prevention of corneal abrasion have been used, including
      taping the eyelids shut, manual eye closure, paraffin-based ointment application into the
      conjunctival sac, and the use of hydrophilic contact lenses, although only a few studies have
      validated the comparison of these methods' effectiveness.

      Eyeprotx™ Protective Goggles have been designed specifically for use in the operating room or
      in any scenario where general anesthesia must be used, such as intubation in an emergency.
      Current ocular protective measures such as tapes during anesthesia have been associated with
      injury and infection. With this study, we hope to find a safer preventative technique against
      ocular injury during the perioperative period.

    <intervention_model_description>In this cohort study, 100 preoperative patients from Jackson Memorial Hospital would be randomly assigned based on age, gender, and type of anesthesia to three samples: anesthesia with Eyeprotx™ Goggles, anesthesia with eyelid tape, and anesthesia with ointment application. Analysis of samples will be based on length of procedure, length of preventative measure application, position during operation(supine or prone), and postoperative events. Patient discomfort or pain, eye dryness intensity would be rated on numerical rating scale. Qualitative analysis will include additional comments from patients and the anesthesiologist.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in Baseline Ocular Condition post-operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>The patient's initial rating will be recorded approximately ten minutes before surgery at the point of anesthesia evaluation and will be reassessed up to 24 hours post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>The following will be measured upon evaluation, using a numerical scale of 1 to 8, with 1 being complete absence of condition and 8 being the most severe presentation of the condition:
1. eye discomfort, 2, pain, and 3. dryness intensity, each on a numerical rating-scale of 1 to 8, The measures will be compared among the goggle, ointment, and tape groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Ocular Complications post-operation</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation of these complications will be done from the point the patient has returned to the recovery room to up to one week post-surgery or until discharge, whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of corneal abrasion, conjunctivitis, MRSA infection, and direct ocular trauma will be assessed by the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist and will be recorded upon diagnosis of condition for all groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Awareness during Anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be evaluated up to 48 hours post-surgical operation.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient awareness of being under anesthesia will be recorded qualitatively, with accounts of anxiety and/or fear being noted, if applicable.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Nightmare during Use</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be evaluated up to 48 hours post-surgical operation.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's report of experiencing nightmares during the surgery will be recorded qualitatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Usability Scale Per Operator</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be evaluated up to 6 months after the post-surgical operation.</time_frame>
    <description>The anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists working on the trial will be asked to complete a usability scale questionnaire to evaluate the effectiveness of the different variation of the goggles, such as goggles with a strap versus goggles with short sterilized adhesive tape.</description>

    <description>Eyeprotx™ Protective Goggles have been designed specifically for use in the operating room or in any scenario where general anesthesia must be used, such as intubation in an emergency. The integral function is to reduce intraocular pressure while in place, prevent operating room bright light penetration, facilitate a swift placement preventative measure with straps, form a barrier against bacterial invasion and mechanical damage. This study would seek to examine this goggles' effectiveness as a preventative measure as vs. other measures.</description>
