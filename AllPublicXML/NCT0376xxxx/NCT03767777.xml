      A prospective, multi-centre, objective performance criteria clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Artery Stent Graft System manufactured by Lifetech Scientific
      (Shenzhen) Co., LTD. for the thoracic aortic dissection involving the aortic arch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was conducted in a qualified clinical trial institution. Investigators
      will use Artery Stent Graft System manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD.
      to treat patients with thoracic aortic dissection involving the aortic arch. This is a
      Prospective, Multi-center, Objective Performance Criteria Clinical Trial. It is expected to
      submit to the ethics committee of the lead unit for review in Sep 2018, and complete the
      implantation of 150 patients in 18 centres nationwide within 12 months, and interim follow-up
      was conducted before discharge, 30 days after surgery, 6 months after surgery and 12 months
      after surgery, long-term follow-up will be performed at 24 months postoperatively, 36 months
      postoperatively, 48 months postoperatively and 60 months postoperatively.

      This trial will evaluate whether the device reached the primary safety endpoint and primary
      efficacy endpoint through two primary endpoint indicators: the incidence of major adverse
      events (MAE) within 30 days and the success rate of aortic dissection treatment 12 months
      after surgery.

      This trail will evaluate whether the device reached the secondary safety endpoint and
      efficacy endpoint through several secondary endpoint indicators:

        1. the incidence of all-cause death at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5 years after
           surgery

        2. the incidence of thoracic aortic dissection-related death at 30 days, 6 months, 12
           months and 2-5 years after surgery

        3. the incidence of severe adverse events (SAE) at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5
           years after surgery

        4. the incidence of the device-related adverse events (AE) at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months
           and 2-5 years after surgery

        5. the Incidence of left upper limb ischemia at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5 years
           after surgery

        6. the incidence of type I or type III leakage at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months after
           surgery

        7. the incidence of graft migration at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months after surgery

        8. the branching vascular patency rate at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months after surgery

        9. the Incidence of Thoracic aortic dissection -related surgical conversion or
           re-intervention at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5 years after surgery According to
           the guidelines for clinical trials of aortic stent system, the sponsor will apply for
           NMPA listing registration after completing a 12-month primary endpoint assessment, and
           annually follow-up will be conducted until the fifth year for the long-term efficacy
           observation.

    <description>The Artery Stent Graft System consists of Ankura pro Aorta Stent Graft System along with Longuette Aortic Branch Stent Graft System for chimney technique in the aim of revascularization of aorta branches.The Ankura pro aorta stent graft and Longuette Aortic Branch Stent Graft System are pre-assembled within delivery system. During the operation, the stent graft was delivered to the target lesion location of the vascular real cavity through a delivery system, which was accurately positioned and released to isolate the ruptured opening of aortic dissection, block the continuous flow of blood into the false cavity of the dissection, and avoid further tearing or even rupture of the dissection.</description>
