      This study evaluates the clinical benefit of TAS-102 in participants with metastatic
      urothelial carcinoma who are resistant to cisplatin or carboplatin front-line and checkpoint
      inhibitors as second line therapy. All participants will receive TAS-102 in oral form twice
      per day on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 of each 28 day cycle.

FACT-Bl total score range is 0-156, derived by the sum of the sub-scales. Higher scores indicate better QOL.
FACT-Bl includes five sub-scales:
Physical Well-being (PWB), score range of 0-28
Social/Family Well-being (SWB), score range of 0-28
Emotional Well-being (EWB), score range of 0-24
Functional Well-being (FWB), score range of 0-28
Bladder Cancer Subscale (BlCS), score range of 0-48
Note: Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from &quot;4&quot;.</description>
