      A Phase 1b/2a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of dose-adjusted brequinar in adult subjects with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Ribavirin BID may be added to brequinar twice weekly in eligible subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 27 subjects will be entered in this Phase 1b/2a multi-center, open-label,
      non-randomized study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of dose-adjusted
      brequinar in adult subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Active Cohort 2 subjects on
      brequinar alone twice weekly may roll over into brequinar twice weekly + ribavirin BID.
      Cohort 3 subjects will begin treatment with brequinar alone twice weekly then move to
      brequinar twice weekly + ribavirin BID as tolerated. Both the brequinar and ribavirin doses
      may be adjusted based on safety, tolerability, and enzyme inhibition levels.

             leukemia-directed therapy to first dose of study drug will be at least 7 days for
             cytotoxic or non-cytotoxic (immunotherapy) agents. Use of supportive care measures per
             institution's standard of care is permitted at any time.

          8. The effects of brequinar on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and for 90 days after completion of brequinar administration.

             leukemia.

          6. Presence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) which requires an equivalent dose of ≥
             0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or therapy beyond systemic corticosteroids (e.g.
             cyclosporine or other calcineurin inhibitors or other immunosuppressive agents used
             for GVHD).

          7. Active cerebrospinal involvement of AML, T-cell leukemia (T-ALL), bi-lineal leukemia

          9. Clinically active hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection.

         10. Severe gastrointestinal or metabolic condition that could interfere with the
             absorption of oral study medication.

         11. Prior malignancy, unless it has not been active or has remained stable for at least 2
             years. Participants with treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma or
             cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, are
             eligible if definitive treatment for the condition has been completed. Participants
             with organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive
             disease are eligible if at the active surveillance stage, hormonal therapy has been
             initiated, or the malignancy has been surgically removed or treated with definitive
             radiotherapy.

         12. Nursing women or women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) with a positive pregnancy
             test.
