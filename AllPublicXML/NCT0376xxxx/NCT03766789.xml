  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHERENCE is a randomized unicentric study that will be carried out from a monovalent center
      of cardiology of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Patients will be randomized
      hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with and without ST segment elevation at
      the time of hospital discharge to receive access to a digital application for smartphones or
      receive written instructions regarding the taking of medication as prescribed by doctors .
      They will have a total follow-up period of 90 days, in which the adherence to medical
      treatment will be evaluated through a questionnaire validated for that purpose.

      The objective of the study is to demonstrate that the use of a digital platform for
      smartphones increases the adherence to medical treatment by 30% in relation to the group
      without intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) states that poor adherence to long-term medical
      treatments severely compromises their effectiveness, with an expected adherence of 50% in
      developed countries and less in developing countries. This non-compliance to medical
      treatment tends to increase as the global burden of chronic diseases increases, where not
      only the rational use of medicines but also compliance with prescribed treatments becomes
      vitally important. So it is of interest to highlight the importance not only of the clarity
      of the medical prescription at the time of hospital discharge but of compliance with it in
      the out-of-hospital setting.

      The lack of adherence to medical treatment is a difficult problem to solve, and this could
      partially explain the ineffectiveness of the treatments administered by the health system.
      Adherence is greater in the acute phase of the disease2, presenting a marked decrease within
      3 to 6 months of treatment3. In order to avoid this problem, multiple interventions have been
      studied without evidence of significant benefits or clinical impact.

      The &quot;Medication Reminder&quot; application will be used as a digital tool for smartphones, which
      is available for different commercial software platforms, free download. The intervention
      group will have the installation of the aforementioned platform on your smartphone, loading
      the list of your medication, as well as an alarm in the hours proposed for the shot. When the
      warning is presented, the patient will have a warning by which he will have to accept or
      reject the taking of the medication; to reject it, the reminder will remain present for 24hs
      and then it will be automatically deleted. At the end of the day, the patient can access an
      analysis of daily compliance and thus perform a self-monitoring. The control group will
      receive the standard of care, consisted of a written list of medications.

      We will evaluate the adherence to medications at 3 months as primary endpoint.

    <description>Rate of patients in each arm with adherence to medical treatment defined by the Morisky Green scale.
The eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) is a structured self-report measure of medication-taking behavior that has been widely used in various cultures. The first seven items are dichotomous response categories with yes or no and the last item was a five point Likert response. The adherence to medications is higher in patients with higher scale values (values from 0 to 8). A patient is consider to have good adherence when score is perfect (8 points)</description>
