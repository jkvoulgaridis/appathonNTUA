  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UNC Get REAL &amp; HEEL (GR&amp;H) program has provided after treatment support for women with a
      breast cancer diagnosis since 2006. The 16-week program includes an individualized training
      program and the opportunity to continue working out in the GR&amp;H facilities at the conclusion
      of the 16-week program. The purpose of this protocol is to implement a research agenda at
      GR&amp;H that will examine the efficacy of the program. The primary aim of this study is a
      pre-post test of the impact of the GR&amp;H program (standardized combination of aerobic and
      resistance training) on VO2peak1,2. The secondary aims of this study are to evaluate quality
      of life as well as cardiorespiratory function (vascular health), physical function (muscular
      strength, body composition), cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes (fatigue,
      depression, anxiety, quality of life). Exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact
      of exercise on biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) immune cell function - total leukocyte
      count, T and natural killer cells, monocytes, and neutrophils count and activity, and (3)
      circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      Evaluate the impact of the Get REAL and HEEL research program (standardized combination of
      aerobic and resistance training) on change in V02peak from pre to post 16-week intervention.

      Secondary:

      Evaluate the impact of the GR&amp;H program (standardized combination of aerobic and resistance
      training) on change in cardiorespiratory function, immunology, physical function parameters,
      cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes from pre to post 16-week intervention.

      Evaluate changes in all measures annually over the 5 year follow-up period.

      Report on enrollment, recruitment, and attrition.

      Exploratory Objectives

      The investigator's exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact of exercise on
      biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) total leukocyte, lymphocyte (T cells and natural killer
      cells), monocyte and neutrophil counts and T cell proliferation assays, natural killer
      cytotoxicity assays, and cytokine production from stimulated neutrophils and monocytes, and
      (3) circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will complete pre-intervention assessments, questionnaires and blood draw at
      week 1 and 2 pre-intervention, followed by a 16-week aerobic and resistance training exercise
      program (intervention). Participants will complete assessments, questionnaires and blood
      draws at week 1 and 2 following the intervention and then again at 6 months and 12 months
      following intervention. Questionnaires only will be administered at year 2, 3,4 and 5
      following intervention.

    <description>Ultrasound -- LogicView™ software (General Electric Company, Milwaukee, WI, USA) will be used to generate real-time panoramic cross-sectional images of the VL. Three panoramic scans at a gain of 50dB and a depth of 5.0 cm. All image analyses will be completed using Image-J software (version 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, USA) with each image area individually scaled from pixels to centimeters via the straight-line function. The polygon function will be used to determine the CSA of the VL by selecting a region including mostly muscle and minimal surrounding fascia. Greater EI values represent greater fibrous (non-muscular) composition.</description>

        Potential study participants with confirmed early-stage breast cancer will be screened
        through a review of daily clinic schedules for patients seen at the North Carolina Cancer
        Hospital. Patients must have recently completed their initial treatment (be within one year
        of completion).

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for this protocol if they have

          -  histologically confirmed early stage (non-metastatic) breast cancer

          -  and have recently (within 1 year) completed their initial treatment (they may continue
             to be on endocrine treatment).

        No exclusions will be made based on ethnicity or race, although patients must be able to
        read and speak English.

        Participants must provide IRB-approved signed written informed consent. The consent
        includes access to their medical records, including demographic and billing information,
        diagnoses, treatments, and laboratory results. Participants may also be asked to provide
        permission to contact their non-UNC doctors for additional medical record information, and
        may also require a medical release from various treating physicians.

        Interested persons must agree to adhere to the 16-week GR&amp;H protocol and complete all blood
        draws, assessments and questionnaires to the best of their ability. The informed consent
        will also include annual follow-up assessments and questionnaires for up to 5 years after
        they have completed the 16-week program.

        Patients who are approached about participating in LCCC1630 and decline to do so are able
        to join GR&amp;H as a supportive care program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Interested persons will be excluded from study participation if

          -  they do not have evidence of a cancer diagnosis or completion of surgery, radiation
             and/or chemotherapy treatment,

          -  or if they have previously completed the GR&amp;H exercise program. Entirely at the
             discretion of GR&amp;H investigators, physical function and other assessments conducted at
             baseline may also determine that a patient is not medically suitable for the GR&amp;H
             protocol. Consented patients who are determined to be medically not suited for the
             GR&amp;H protocol (unevaluable) will remain in the study for analyses comparing those who
             are evaluable with those who are not.
