  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an interventional endoscopy
      procedure utilized in the therapeutic management of pancreatobiliary diseases including
      gallstones, bile duct strictures, leaks and infections, pancreatitis, and cancers of the bile
      duct or pancreas. ERCP is classified as a high risk procedure. Potential adverse events
      directly attributable to the technical aspects of ERCP include pancreatitis, hemorrhage,
      infection, and bowel wall perforation. Other potential adverse events of ERCP may be less
      apparent and/or unknown, such as risk of neurocognitive dysfunction. Overall, neurocognitive
      dysfunction after medical procedures impacts quality of life, functional disability,
      depression, and caregiver and societal burden.

      The prevalence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction and disability following
      interventional endoscopy procedures such as ERCP has not been reported. This prospective
      observational study is designed to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment and
      functional disability after ERCP and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedures in older
      patients, and to assess whether specific patient and/or procedural factors are associated
      with increased risk of adverse outcomes.

    <description>Neurocognitive function will be assessed via a phone battery derived from standard cognitive tests proven feasible and valid to assess memory, attention, reasoning, and executive functioning. Functional status will also be assessed via phone. The duration of time required for the patient to complete telephone interview for neurocognitive and functional assessment will be approximately 45 minutes per time point.</description>
