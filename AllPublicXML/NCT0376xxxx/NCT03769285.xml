  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common long-term side effect of anti-rejection (immunosuppressant) medications is skin
      cancer. This pilot clinical trial evaluates the feasibility of conducting a larger pivotal
      trial to examine the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide for prevention of keratinocyte
      carcinoma in solid organ transplant recipients. This pilot trial will transition into the
      pivotal trial if all feasibility targets are met.
