  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of PTC299 and
      the metabolite, O-desmethyl PTC299, in participants with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) who have exhausted standard available therapies known to provide clinical
      benefit. The study is designed as a series of cohort-based dose escalations. For each cohort,
      a minimum of 3 evaluable participants with PK and safety data will be assessed. Additional
      participants will be recruited if additional PK data are needed to assess mean exposure based
      on the observed variability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have relapsed/refractory AML and exhausted standard available
             therapies known to provide clinical benefit.

          -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less
             than or equal to (≤) 2

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be willing to practice a highly-effective method
             of birth control for up to 50 days after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate to the study, have the ability to understand
             and adhere to study visit schedule and other protocol procedures, and be able and
             willing to sign a written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persistence of any clinically relevant (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             [CTCAE] Grade 2 or above) toxicities from previous therapy.

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Previous drug-induced liver injury.

        Cardiac assessments:

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris.

             the last 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to entering the study
             with possible or known effects of QT prolongation. (If equivalent medication is not
             available, QTc will be closely monitored.)

        Laboratory assessments:

             Immunoglobulin M (IgM).

          -  Any other malignancies within the past 2 years other than basal cell skin cancer or

             needed, at the discretion of investigator.

          -  Participant is receiving moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. (Note: This exclusion
             criterion is not applicable to subjects participating in sub-study where only subjects
             who are currently on/require antifungals [prophylaxis/treatment] will be enrolled)
