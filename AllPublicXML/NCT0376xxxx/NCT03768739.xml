  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to determine the incidence of dysphagia and vocal fold mobility
      impairment (VFMI) in individuals undergoing cardiothoracic surgical procedures. It also seeks
      to determine the impact of postoperative swallowing impairment on health-related outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairment and VFMI are common, yet often overlooked, complications of cardiac
      surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population
      is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment techniques and
      validated outcomes in all patents undergoing cardiac surgery. We therefore aimed to determine
      the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population and to characterize impairment
      profiles related to swallowing safety and efficiency. We also aimed to assess the relative
      impact of VFMI and dysphagia on health-related outcomes such as length of hospital stay,
      pneumonia, sepsis, reintubation, and discharge status.

    <measure>Penetration Aspiration Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of safety to swallowing bolus trials. The development and use of an 8-point, equal-appearing interval scale (8 being best; 1 being worst) to describe penetration and aspiration events are described. Scores are determined primarily by the depth to which material passes in the airway and by whether or not material entering the airway is expelled.</description>

    <measure>Yale Residue Severity Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of efficiency to swallowing bolus trials. The Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale was developed, standardized, and validated to provide reliable, anatomically defined, and image-based assessment of post-swallow pharyngeal residue severity as observed during fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). It is a five-point ordinal rating scale based on residue location (vallecula and pyriform sinus) and amount (none, trace, mild, moderate, and severe)</description>
