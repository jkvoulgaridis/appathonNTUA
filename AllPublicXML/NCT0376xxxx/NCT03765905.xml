      The aim of this study was to investigate serum SCUBE1 and SCUBE3 levels in PCOS and non-PCOS
      cases compared with non-PCOS healthy controls with similar age and body mass index.

      This will be a prospective clinical laboratory study,It will include women with PCOS
      diagnosis (according to the 2003 Rotherdam criteria). 40 cases of reproductive age will be
      included in the study group, which will be included in the survey after being approved for
      participation in the survey from field trials. Forty patients who will not have any
      complaints between the ages of 18-35 who will apply to the gynecology policlinic as a control
      group but who had no PCOS o rany other systemic problems and will be similar in terms of age
      group and body mass index will be included in the study after being approved for
      participation in the study. From the study and control group, 5 mL of blood will be taken
      from the untreated biochemical tube for serum SCUBE1 SCUBE2 SCUBE3. The blood samples will be
      centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes and the serum fraction will be obtained and the serum
      will be stored at -80 ° C to be stored until the day of the tube operation. Serum SCUBE1,
      SCUBE2 SCUBE3 levels will be measured using ELISA kits. ,
