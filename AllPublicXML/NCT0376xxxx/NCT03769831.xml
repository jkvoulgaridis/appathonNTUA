  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombosis is a maladaptive process of vascular occlusion and remains a primary cause of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, The dose-limiting issue with available anticoagulant
      therapies is bleeding. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of SHR2285 tablets in healthy subjects. In addition, this study will provide
      information on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of SHR2285 tablets in healthy subjects.
