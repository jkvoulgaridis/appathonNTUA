  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the only recognized potentially curative therapy for
      malignant neoplasms located in the peri-ampullary region, and is increasingly being used for
      the treatment of cancer through the resection of the premalignant precursors for invasive
      carcinomas.Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is one of the most common complications
      associated with substantial clinical implications following PD, which significantly affects
      mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and overall hospital costs. Therefore, the
      prevention of POPF has always been a high priority for our group as well as other
      international surgical groups. In 1995, investigators' group established the Chen's U-stitch
      approach, which was a new technique of end-to-end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy with
      transpancreatic transverse U-sutures after PD, and the preliminary results were quite
      encouraging at that time. Thus, investigators intend to conduct a multicentre, randomized,
      parallel-group controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the effect and safety of the new
      technique.

      This is a multicentre, randomized, parallel-group controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the
      effect and safety of Chen's U-Suture technique for pancreaticojejunostomy following
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. Investigators plan to enroll 960 patients in this study and eligible
      patients will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will use Chen's U-Suture
      technique and other group will use classic duct-to-mucosa technique. All patients will be
      followed up for 3 month after surgery, and primary outcome is POPF, other outcome such as
      duration of operation, grade of POPF, morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay,
      reoperation rate, postoperative pancreatic function and postoperative incidence of chronic
      pancreatic diseases.
