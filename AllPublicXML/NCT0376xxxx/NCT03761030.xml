  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Late Life Depression (LLD) often have cognitive problems, particularly
      problems with memory, attention, and problem solving, all of which contribute to
      antidepressant non-response. Our group and others have shown that decreased thinking speed is
      the central cause of functional problems in patients with LLD. Similarly, decreased walking
      speed is associated with depression and carries additional risk for falls, hospitalization,
      and death. Available evidence suggests that declining functionality in the brain's dopamine
      system contributes to age-related cognitive and motor slowing. The central hypothesis of this
      study is that by enhancing dopamine functioning in the brain and improving cognitive and
      motor slowing, administration of carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) will improve depressive symptoms
      in older adults.

      N=90 adults of which 30 participants will undergo scanning procedures, aged 60 and older with
      (1) a DSM 5 depressive disorder, (2) significant depressive symptoms, and (3) decreased
      thinking or walking speed will receive 8 weeks of treatment with L-DOPA up to 450mg. We will
      test whether L-DOPA increases brain dopamine release using neuroimaging and whether it speeds
      up thinking and walking speed. Data collected in the proposed studies may help identify a new
      treatment for LLD, which could have large public health ramifications given the prevalence,
      frequent treatment resistance, and chronicity characteristic of LLD. This project also will
      elucidate the neurobiology of slowing at molecular, structural, and functional levels of
      analysis, increasing our understanding of the interplay between these aging-associated
      processes and the pathophysiologic changes underlying late life neuropsychiatric disorders.
      Exploring patient characteristics that predict response to L-DOPA may provide useful
      information to guide differential therapeutics and develop personalized medicine for LLD.

    <description>Our target is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The HRSD is a 24-item questionnaire used as an indication of depression and a guide to evaluate recovery. Total scores range from 0-74, not including atypical symptoms sub-scale. A score of 16 or above is typically considered to indicate the presence of depressive symptoms. Higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

Each subject assigned to the L-DOPA arm will be titrated to 450mg L-DOPA unless they cannot tolerate higher doses, in which case subjects will have their dosage reduced to the maximum tolerable dose</description>
