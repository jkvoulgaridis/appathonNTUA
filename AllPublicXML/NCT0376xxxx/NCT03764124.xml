  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To further develop personalized medicine in kidney transplantation and improve transplant
      patient outcomes, attention has been given to define early surrogate endpoints that might aid
      therapeutic interventions, and help clinical decision-making.

      To adequately predict transplant patients' individual risks of allograft loss and patients'
      complications, this would require a complex integration of data, including: donor data,
      recipient characteristics, transplant characteristics, biopsies results, immunosuppressive
      regimen, allograft infections, acute kidney injuries, recipient immune profiles, protocol and
      per cause biopsies and imaging (PET/CT imaging).

      This project aims:

        1. Assessed the usefulness of 18F‐FDG PET/CT imaging in kidney transplantation recipients
           presenting with suspected acute rejection who underwent a transplant needle biopsy;

        2. To develop a prognostic risk score to predict kidney allograft survival;

        3. To evaluate the impact of corticoids withdrawal on long term outcomes (risk of rejection
           and impact on bone mineral density);

        4. Evaluate the type and the frequencies of complications in our kidney transplant
           population

      1. The detection of acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients, depends critically on
           assessments of serum creatinine, an insensitive measure of renal injury and the
           diagnosis relies on renal transplant needle biopsy which is an invasive procedure
           associated with a significant risk of bleeding and graft loss and is limited by sampling
           error and/or interobserver variability. Moreover, repeated biopsies to evaluate a renal
           graft's status pose challenges, including practicability and cost. Consequently, other
           sensitive and less invasive modalities, including gene expression profiling and omic
           analyses of blood and urine samples as well as in vivo imaging, are currently under
           investigation to reinforce our clinical armamentarium for acute rejection diagnosis.
           Likewise, it would be useful to non-invasively predict rejection in kidney transplant
           recipients with acute renal dysfunction and suspected acute rejection, thereby avoiding
           unnecessary transplant biopsy.

        2. This study aims to generate a scoring system that predicts individual patients' risk of
           long-term kidney allograft failure.

        3. Since 2007, the protocol in our institution is to withdraw the corticoids after 3 months
           after the protocol biopsy if no sign of rejection is demonstrated. We would like to
           evaluate the impact of such decision in the risk of rejection and the long-term
           allograft outcome in our patients. We are looking also to the impact on bone mineral
           density after corticoids withdrawal in those patients.

        4. Evaluate the type and the frequencies of complications in our kidney transplant
           population to adapt our daily basis clinical practice.

    <description>The PET/CT procedure was performed using cross-calibrated Philips Gemini TF Big Bore or TF 16 PET/CT systems (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH) at 201 18 minutes following intravenous injection of a mean dose of 3.2 0.2 MBq/kg of body weight of 18 F-FDG. A low-dose helical CT (5-mm slice thickness, 120-kV tube voltage, and 40-mAs tube current-time product) centered to the renal transplant was performed, followed by PET scanning with two bed positions, each lasting 240 seconds. Images were reconstructed using iterative list mode time-of-flight algorithms. Corrections for attenuation, dead time and random and scatter events were applied.</description>
