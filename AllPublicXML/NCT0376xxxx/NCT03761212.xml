  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FoLoMI is a pilot study in which the investigators will seek to determine if gait
      spatio-temporal and kinematic parameters can explain the evolution of a functional score, the
      Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), at 18 months.

      The secondary objectives are: (1) to study the relationship between gait parameters measured
      at T0 and the BASFI at T0, (2) to study the relationship between gait parameters at T0 and
      the BASDAI at T0, (3) to assess general state of health of the patients and its evolution by
      appreciating: level of physical activity, state of fatigue, diurnal sleepiness and quality of
      life, and (4) to compare spatio-temporal gait parameters between patients and healthy
      controls.

      This longitudinal cohort study is aiming to follow 60 persons with ankylosing spondylitis
      during 18 months. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and every 6 months.

      An healthy control group of 30 persons will be included and age and sex matched to the first
      30 patients.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Bath Ankylosing Functional Index (BASFI) measures functional consequences of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The patient indicates its level of ability in ten domains of daily life: put the socks, bend to pick a pen from the floor, reach up to a high shelf, get up from a chair and from the floor, stand unsupported for 10 minutes, climb steps, look over the shoulder, do physically demanding activities and do a full days activities. Each question is answered on a 10 cm horizontal visual analog scale, the mean of which gives the BASFI score (0-10). Higher is the score, higher are the functional consequences of AS.</description>

Six 10 cm horizontal visual analog scales are used to measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain, localized tenderness and morning stiffness (qualitative and quantitative). The final BASDAI score has a range from 0 to 10, with higher scores meaning higher activity of the disease.</description>
