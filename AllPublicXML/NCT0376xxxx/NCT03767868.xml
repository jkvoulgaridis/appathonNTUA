  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate whether a color changing nail polish would be an
      indicator to assess infraclavicular brachial plexus block success based on skin temperature
      differences before and after performed the block.

      After performed the block, sensory and motor block assessments will be carried out by blinded
      observer every 5 min after needle removal for 30 min in the regions of the radial, median,
      ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves of the forearm. Skin temperature measurements will be
      performed from both the anesthetized side and the contralateral arm before the procedure and
      every 5 min for 30 min by a blinded observer. Before the block, the color changing nail
      polish will be applied to all hand nails of the patient. An independent observer will
      photograph the reaction of the nail polish (i.e. color change) in both hands immediately
      after application of nail polish and at two minute intervals for 30 min after performing the
      block. Two blinded observers were reviewed the digital photographs. They were asked to
      compare the colors of nail polish in both hands and to score the difference based on a
      three-point scale (0: absolutely no difference, 1: I am not sure, 2: indisputable difference)

They will be asked to compare the colors of nail polish before and after block performance in both hands and to rate the difference based on a three-point scale (0: absolutely no difference, 1: I am not sure, 2: indisputable difference).</description>
