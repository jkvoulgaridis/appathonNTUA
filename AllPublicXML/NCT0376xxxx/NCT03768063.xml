      This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study. Patients who are receiving clinical
      benefit from atezolizumab monotherapy or atezolizumab in combination with other agent(s) or
      comparator agent(s) during participation in a Genentech or Roche-sponsored study (the parent
      study), who are eligible to continue treatment and who do not have access to the study
      treatment locally, may continue to receive study treatment in this extension study following
      roll-over from the parent study.
