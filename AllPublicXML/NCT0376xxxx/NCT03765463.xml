  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aversive sensory phenomena such as premonitory urges play a central role in the behavioral
      treatment model of tics. Extinction learning and extinction recall are learning processes
      implicated within this model, but have not been directly evaluated in youth with Tourette
      syndrome (TS). This study examines extinction learning and extinction recall in youth with TS
      using an experimental task. This study will also explore the relationship between extinction
      processes (i.e., extinction learning and extinction recall) and treatment outcomes with
      behavior therapy. Findings from this investigation will be used to update the behavioral
      treatment model, which serves as the basis for evidence-based behavioral interventions.

    <measure>Tic severity as assessed by the Hopkins Motor and Vocal Tic Scale (HM/VTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week after completion of HRT</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will nominate up to five motor and five vocal tics they deem bothersome on the HM/VTS. Each bothersome tic is then rated by a clinician on the composite two (vocal and motor) 5-point HM/VTS scale ranging from none (0) to severe (4) for the motor as well as vocal tics. The individual tic scores are summed (minimum of 0 and maximum of 40) and averaged together to create an average tic severity score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tic severity as assessed by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Revised (YGTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week after completion of HRT</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is a clinician-rated semi-structured interview that measures tic symptom severity over the previous week. It consists of 10-items that assess different dimensions of tic severity for motor and vocal tics, which are rated on a 0-5 scale. The YGTSS produces a Total Tic Score (range: 0-50), with higher ratings indicating greater tic severity. The YGTSS has demonstrated treatment sensitivity to pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions.</description>
