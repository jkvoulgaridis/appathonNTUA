  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-cohort, longitudinal, single-center, clinical
      study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101
      (autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced ex vivo with EFS (Elongation
      Factor 1α Short form) Lentiviral Vector (LV) encoding for the human ADA gene) administered to
      ADA-SCID subjects between the ages of &gt;/=30 days and &lt;18 years of age, who are not eligible
      for an Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched sibling/family donor and meeting the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. The OTL-101 product is infused after a minimal interval of at
      least 24 hours following the completion of reduced intensity conditioning. For subjects who
      successfully receive the OTL-101 product, pegademase bovine (PEG-ADA) Enzyme Replacement
      Therapy (ERT) is discontinued at Day+30 (-3/+15) after the transplant. After their discharge
      from hospital, the subjects will be seen at regular intervals to review their history,
      perform examinations and draw blood samples to assess immunity and safety.
