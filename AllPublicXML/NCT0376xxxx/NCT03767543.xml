      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that the simple daily titration algorithm is non-inferior to the weekly
      titration algorithm according to Canadian labeling.

      Secondary Objective:

      To gain additional information on the efficacy and safety of using a simple patient-titration
      protocol for administration of insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed-ratio combination
      (iGlarLixi).

      The maximum duration of study per patient is approximately 29 weeks including a 2-week
      screening, a 26-week randomized active-controlled treatment period, and 3-day post-treatment
      safety follow-up period.

             with cholecystectomy), pancreatitis during previous treatment with incretin therapies,
             chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, or stomach/gastric surgery

          -  Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer or genetic conditions
