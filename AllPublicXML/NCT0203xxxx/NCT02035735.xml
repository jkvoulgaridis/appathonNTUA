      The aim of this study is to prospectively determine if the use of NBI endoscopy modifies the
      superficial extension of these tumors.

      Several studies have already showed the interest of the use of NBI for the early diagnosis of
      malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract. For all tumors, the most accurate evaluation
      of its limits is very important to perform the best strategy of treatment. If surgery seems
      to be the best option, surgical margins must be widely healthy. Despite the systematic
      transnasal flexible endoscopy with white lamp followed by laryngoscopy under general
      anesthesia (LGA) and tomodensitometric evaluation, surgical margins can be unhealthy (in situ
      carcinoma or dysplasia). We propose to evaluate if the use of the NBI could be useful to
      determine the superficial spread of squamous cell carcinomas in these locations.

      To April 2013 to Mars 2015, all patients with a suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx and whom a LGA are expected, are included. The day before
      the LGA, two endoscopies by two different physicians were performed for each patients and
      recorded: the first one with white light and the second one with NBI. All results are noted
      on a schema. Superficial extension or synchronous lesions showed by NBI are analysed and
      compared with with lamp technic.

      After surgery, surgical margins were evaluated and healthy margins were measured.
