  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2879552 is a potent, selective, mechanism-based inactivator of Lysine Specific Demethylase
      1 (LSD1)/ CoRepressor for Element-1-Silencing Transcription factor (CoREST) activity. This is
      a phase I, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, 2-part first time in human (FTIH) study
      for GSK2879552. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for GSK2879552 based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles observed after oral administration of GSK2879552. Any dose
      level(s) may be expanded up to 12 subjects in order to collect additional data on PK and
      PD.The safety and PK/PD data will be reviewed prior to the dose decision, and the dose
      escalation will be guided by the Neuenschwander -continuous reassessment method (N-CRM).
      Built-in safety constraints are in place to prevent exposing subjects to undue risk of
      toxicity. Once RP2D is identified, an expansion cohort (Part 2) of up to 30 subjects will be
      enrolled to further evaluate the clinical activity and tolerability of GSK2879552 in subjects
      with relapsed/refractory SCLC.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was planned as a 2-part, first time in human study in participants with relapsed/refractory small cell lung carcinoma. Part 1 was a dose escalation cohort and Part 2 was an expansion cohort. Participants were planned to receive GSK2879552 at a starting dose of 0.25 milligrams (mg) once daily for 28 days.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was terminated early during Part 1 as the risk benefit in relapsed refractory SCLC did not favor continuation of the study. Data was collected only in Part 1 and no participants were enrolled in Part 2. A total of 29 participants enrolled and received treatment in Part 1. Of which 7 prematurely withdrawn and 22 completed study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, other situations and is associated with liver injury or impaired liver function. The analysis was performed on All Treated Population which included all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of clinical chemistry parameters including potassium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid, glucose, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), albumin, sodium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphorus, inorganic. Baseline value was defined as the most recent, non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to or on the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The number of participants with any grade increase in clinical chemistry parameters have been presented. The clinical chemistry parameters for which any grade increase worst-case on-therapy value was reported have been only summarized. NA represents data was not available. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Change in Hematology Toxicity Grade From Baseline</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, total neutrophils, platelet count and white blood cell (WBC) count. Baseline value was defined as the most recent, non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to or on the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The number of participants with any grade increase in hematology parameters have been presented. The hematology parameters for which any grade increase worst-case on-therapy value was reported have been only summarized.</description>

          <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Change in Hematology Toxicity Grade From Baseline</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, total neutrophils, platelet count and white blood cell (WBC) count. Baseline value was defined as the most recent, non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to or on the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The number of participants with any grade increase in hematology parameters have been presented. The hematology parameters for which any grade increase worst-case on-therapy value was reported have been only summarized.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for pharmacokinetic analysis including T1/2 following single (Day 1) and repeat dose (Day 15) administration of GSK2879552. Pharmacokinetic analysis of GSK2879552 in Part 1 was conducted by non-compartmental methods. NA represents data was not available. The data for Day 15 was not computed due to the long half-life of GSK2879552.

        <description>Time invariance was assessed to evaluate whether the pharmacokinetics remains unaltered after repeat dosing. The mixed effect model was fitted with day as a fixed effect and participant as a random effect for each treatment (dose) separately. AUC (0-tau) on Day 15 was compared to AUC (0-infinity) on Day 1 in order to assess time invariance for each dose. The ratio and 90 percent CI were calculated by back-transforming the difference between the LS means for the two days and associated 90 percent CI, for each dose.

Clinical response was defined as disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) based on RECIST version 1.1 at Week 16. Disease control rate was defined as number of participants achieving CR, PR and SD per RECIST version 1.1. The number of participants achieving disease control rate have been presented.</description>

        <description>The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of GSK2879552 administered orally was characterized by linear and/or non-linear mixed effect models. Only dose cohorts with repeat daily dosing were included in the analysis of platelet as a pharmacodynamic effect. Baseline was defined as the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Percentage change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Estimates and standard error have been presented.</description>
