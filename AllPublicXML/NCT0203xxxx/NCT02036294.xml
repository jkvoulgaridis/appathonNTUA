  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves development and testing of a patient and family-centered transitional
      care program for patients who are hospitalized with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) exacerbations. The study intervention includes tailored services to address individual
      patients' biopsychosocial needs, starting early during hospital stay and continuing for 3
      months post hospital discharge.

      The study hypothesis is that compared to usual care, the study intervention will : a) Improve
      patient health- related quality of life and survival, and reduce use of hospital and
      emergency room visits; b) result in improved patient experience, self- confidence, and
      self-care behaviors; c) result in improved family caregivers coping skills, self-confidence,
      and problem solving skills to address patient barriers to care and treatment.

      This study evaluates using a randomized controlled trial design the impact of a patient and
      family-centered transitional care program named the BREATHE program. The BREATHE program
      stands for 'Better Respiratory Education and Treatment Help Empower'. The BREATHE program
      offers the following:

        1. Individualized transition support services to help ensure that the patient (and family
           caregiver if available) are prepared for discharge, understand the discharge plan of
           care, and receive post discharge follow up to help meet their needs

        2. Tailored COPD self-management education and support program that starts during the
           hospital stay and continues post discharge in the community setting

        3. Facilitated access to community based services.

      The intervention is delivered by a new team member called &quot;COPD Nurse Transition Guide&quot;. The
      new team member works with both the hospital and outpatient care teams, is a registered nurse
      with homecare services experience, and have received additional training in COPD
      self-management and motivational interviewing. The nurse meets participants in the hospital
      and then follows up with them via home visits and phone calls.The intervention involves both
      patients and family caregivers (if available), is literacy adapted, and follows a tailored
      approach based on patient needs, priorities, and preferences.

    <time_frame>Measured at 6 months post 'index-hospitalization'</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure in this study is the mean number of COPD-related hospitalizations and ED visits per patient within each study arm . The number of hospital and ED visits per patient were counted at 6 months post 'index-hospitalization'. Index-hospitalization refers to the hospitalization in which the patient was enrolled into the study. A COPD- related hospitalization was defined as a hospitalization with discharge diagnosis of COPD exacerbation or Pneumonia; a hospitalization where the participant was admitted for congestive heart failure but received treatment for COPD exacerbation (nebulizer treatment plus steroids) ; or, admitted for symptoms pertaining to COPD and received steroids. A COPD- related ED visit was defined as a visit where the treating physician stated that the visit reason is COPD; or, where the participant was discharged on treatment with oral steroids or on treatment for pneumonia.</description>

    <description>This outcome measures the mean change in patient participants' quality of life as measured by the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over the 6 month study period within each study arm.The St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is a widely used validated disease- specific instrument that measures health-related quality of life. The SGRQ measures, using patient self-report, disease impact on symptoms, patient activity, and daily life. The total score for SGRQ ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The change in a patient's quality of life was calculated as the difference in their total score at 6 months post index-hospitalization from baseline. A difference of 4 points in total score is considered a clinically meaningful difference.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure in this study is the mean number of COPD-related hospitalizations and ED visits per patient within each study arm . The number of hospital and ED visits per patient were counted at 6 months post 'index-hospitalization'. Index-hospitalization refers to the hospitalization in which the patient was enrolled into the study. A COPD- related hospitalization was defined as a hospitalization with discharge diagnosis of COPD exacerbation or Pneumonia; a hospitalization where the participant was admitted for congestive heart failure but received treatment for COPD exacerbation (nebulizer treatment plus steroids) ; or, admitted for symptoms pertaining to COPD and received steroids. A COPD- related ED visit was defined as a visit where the treating physician stated that the visit reason is COPD; or, where the participant was discharged on treatment with oral steroids or on treatment for pneumonia.</description>

        <description>This outcome measures the mean change in patient participants' quality of life as measured by the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over the 6 month study period within each study arm.The St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is a widely used validated disease- specific instrument that measures health-related quality of life. The SGRQ measures, using patient self-report, disease impact on symptoms, patient activity, and daily life. The total score for SGRQ ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The change in a patient's quality of life was calculated as the difference in their total score at 6 months post index-hospitalization from baseline. A difference of 4 points in total score is considered a clinically meaningful difference.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Patients' Score on the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire Within Each Study Arm</title>
        <description>This outcome measures the mean change in patient participants' quality of life as measured by the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over the 3 month study period within each study arm.The St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is a widely used validated disease- specific instrument that measures health-related quality of life. The SGRQ measures, using patient self-report, disease impact on symptoms, patient activity, and daily life. The total score for SGRQ ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The change in a patient's quality of life was calculated as the difference in their total score at 3 months post index-hospitalization from baseline. A difference of 4 points in total score is considered a clinically meaningful difference.</description>
