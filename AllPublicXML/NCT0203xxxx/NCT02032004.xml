  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether transendocardial delivery of
      allogeneic human bone marrow-derived MPCs (rexlemestrocel-L) is effective in the treatment of
      chronic heart failure due to LV systolic dysfunction.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single transendocardial
      delivery in the cardiac catheterization laboratory of human bone marrow-derived allogeneic
      MPCs (rexlemestrocel-L) for improvement in clinical outcomes (HF-MACE), preventing further
      adverse cardiac remodeling (LVESV and LVEDV), and increasing exercise capacity (6MWT) in
      patients with chronic HF due to LV systolic dysfunction of either ischemic or nonischemic
      etiology who have received optimal medical/revascularization therapy.
