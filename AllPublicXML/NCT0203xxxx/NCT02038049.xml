  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, partially blinded, placebo-controlled, non-confirmatory study to
      assess the effects of a single infusion of VAY736 on disease activity as measured by brain
      MRI scans in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

      The study was planned to be conducted in approximately 96 patients. However, after enrolling
      8 patients, the recruitment was terminated based on strategic considerations.

    <description>A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality, or worsening of previously stable, or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from the onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5 C) or infection. A relapse was considered confirmed when confirmed by an Extended disability status scale (EDSS)-certified physician who was not involved in the treatment of the patient, was blinded to treatment allocation, and had no access to patient medical records. It was recommended that this occurs within 5 days of the onset of symptoms. A relapse was confirmed when it was accompanied by an increase of at least half a point (0.5) on the EDSS or an increase of 1 point on two different Functional Systems (FS) of the EDSS or 2 points on one of the FS (excluding Bowel/Bladder or Cerebral FS). Only descriptive statistics performed.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Relapse-free Patients Over the 16 Weeks of the Treatment Period.</title>
        <description>A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality, or worsening of previously stable, or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from the onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5 C) or infection. A relapse was considered confirmed when confirmed by an Extended disability status scale (EDSS)-certified physician who was not involved in the treatment of the patient, was blinded to treatment allocation, and had no access to patient medical records. It was recommended that this occurs within 5 days of the onset of symptoms. A relapse was confirmed when it was accompanied by an increase of at least half a point (0.5) on the EDSS or an increase of 1 point on two different Functional Systems (FS) of the EDSS or 2 points on one of the FS (excluding Bowel/Bladder or Cerebral FS). Only descriptive statistics performed.</description>
