  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The (PYR1)-apelin-13 is an endogenous peptide discovered relatively recently (1998). The
      apelin and its receptor, which is named apj, are expressed in many tissues including
      sensitive to the action of insulin, such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and heart tissue.

      Recent work by the team of Prof. P.Valet (INSERM U1048, Toulouse) opened a new field of
      investigation, demonstrating for the first time in mouse models that apelin exerts a
      glucose-regulating in vivo action. The investigators propose a translational clinical
      research project whose goal is to provide the proof of concept of the favorable influence of
      apelin on insulin sensitivity in humans.
