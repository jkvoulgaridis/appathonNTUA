    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IUB SCu300A spherical copper IUD
      compared to the standard T shaped copper IUD, the TCu380.

      Participants will be followed for one year and quality of life measurements will be measured
      during this period as well.
