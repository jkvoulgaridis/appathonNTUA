  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the effect of treatment with a combination of ear
      solutions on the reduction of pain symptoms at 1 hour after dosing in children with acute
      otitis media.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduction of pain symptoms will be measured by using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry,
      Consolability Scale (FLACC) and the Faces pain Scale Revised (FPS-R).

    <description>The FLACC was completed by the caregiver to assess pain intensity for subjects aged 2 months to less than 5 years. The FLACC consists of five domains that are rated as 0, 1, or 2 (total scores range from 0 to 10). A lower score indicates lower level of pain.
The FPS-R was completed by the subject aged 5 to 12 years. For this assessment, the subject selected the pain intensity by using faces that show increasing discomfort. Total scores range from 0 to 10. A lower score indicates lower level of pain.</description>

        <description>The FLACC was completed by the caregiver to assess pain intensity for subjects aged 2 months to less than 5 years. The FLACC consists of five domains that are rated as 0, 1, or 2 (total scores range from 0 to 10). A lower score indicates lower level of pain.
The FPS-R was completed by the subject aged 5 to 12 years. For this assessment, the subject selected the pain intensity by using faces that show increasing discomfort. Total scores range from 0 to 10. A lower score indicates lower level of pain.</description>

The FLACC was completed by the caregiver to assess pain intensity for subjects aged 2 months to less than 5 years. The FLACC consists of five domains that are rated as 0, 1, or 2 (total scores range from 0 to 10). A lower score indicates lower level of pain.
The FPS-R was completed by the subject aged 5 to 12 years. For this assessment, the subject selected the pain intensity by using faces that show increasing discomfort. Total scores range from 0 to 10. A lower score indicates lower level of pain.</description>

The FLACC was completed by the caregiver to assess pain intensity for subjects aged 2 months to less than 5 years. The FLACC consists of five domains that are rated as 0, 1, or 2 (total scores range from 0 to 10). A lower score indicates lower level of pain.
The FPS-R was completed by the subject aged 5 to 12 years. For this assessment, the subject selected the pain intensity by using faces that show increasing discomfort. Total scores range from 0 to 10. A lower score indicates lower level of pain.</description>
