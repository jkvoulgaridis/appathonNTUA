  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is twofold. First, to examine the efficacy of
      a 24-session, 6-month family-based behavioral intervention (FBBI) - as compared to a waitlist
      FBBI group, which later receives the same FBBI - that targets weight loss in
      adolescents/young adults with intellectual disability aged 14-22 years. Second, to examine
      the efficacy of a 12-session, 6-month Maintenance intervention that targets maintenance of
      weight loss in the same population of adolescents/young adults with intellectual disability.
      The Maintenance condition follows the completion of each FBBI group and involves a
      re-randomization to either the Maintenance intervention or no further intervention. Primary
      outcome measures include body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI). Secondary outcome measures
      include physical activity/sedentary behavior (measured via accelerometry), dietary patterns
      (3-Day Food Records), and self-efficacy (brief questionnaire). Hypotheses are that: (1)
      participants in the FBBI condition will lose more weight (and reduced BMI) than participants
      in the waitlist treatment condition, and that (2) participants in the Maintenance condition
      will maintain weight lost (and reductions in BMI) or experience less weight regain, as
      compared with participants who receive no further intervention following FBBI.

    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL), change from BL to 6 months, change from BL to 12 months and change from BL to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity refers to participants' physical movement, performed at light, moderate, and vigorous levels of exertion. Physical activity was measured via Actigraph accelerometers worn over 7 day intervals at each measurement point - baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months. In addition to light, moderate and vigorous physical activity, sedentary behavior was also estimated from the Actigraph records.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (BL), change from BL to 6 months, change from BL to 12 months and change from BL to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary patterns refers to consistencies in each participants' food intake, determined via analysis of 3-Day Food Records completed at each measurement point: baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.</description>

    <measure>Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL), change from BL to 6 months, change from BL to 12 months and change from BL to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy is a measure of a participant's perceived confidence in their ability to competently engage in a behavior. In this study, self-efficacy is assessed for adolescent participants' dietary and physical activity behaviors. Self-efficacy was obtained via a brief, 2-question interview with the adolescent participants.</description>
