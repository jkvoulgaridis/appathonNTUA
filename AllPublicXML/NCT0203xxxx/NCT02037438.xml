  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sustainable Methods, Algorithms, and Research Tools for Delivering Optimal Care Study (SMART
      DOCS) was designed to develop and evaluate a new approach (patient-centered outcomes and
      coordinated-care management [PCCM]) for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.
      Specialized and pertinent information and resources regarding sleep disorder management were
      developed and made available through an online portal, allowing patients to make informed
      health care decisions, and providers to assist patients in achieving what they feel are the
      most important goals regarding their care. Half of participants were randomized into the
      conventional diagnosis and treatment (CONV) arm and the other half into the patient-centered
      outcomes and coordinated-care management (PCCM) arm. Validated objective and subjective
      assessment measures were administered at intervals throughout a 13 month participation period
      in both the CONV and PCCM arms to determine whether the new PCCM approach for sleep medicine
      results in increased patient satisfaction, quality of care, and improved health outcomes.
      Qualifying participants were 18 years of age or older and presenting with a new sleep
      disorder. Patients received no monetary compensation.

      SMART DOCS is a randomized comparative clinical trial designed to evaluate a new approach of
      outpatient medical care. In current sleep medicine practice, a consultation lasting one hour
      or less is allotted for the assessment, diagnosis, planning, and implementation of sleep
      disorders among patients and their health care provider. Patients are expected to convey
      their complex medical history and relevant symptoms, while clinicians must effectively and
      appropriately diagnose and create a treatment plan in this given period of time.

      New technology for home-based diagnostic testing and electronic access to diagnostic results
      and outcomes provides functional advantages to the delivery of healthcare in an outpatient
      setting. The project was designed to compare the traditional diagnostic and treatment medical
      outpatient approach to a patient-centered outcomes and coordinated-care management (PCCM)
      approach for sleep medicine. New or refined methods, algorithms, and tools were expected to
      improve clinical practice and the patient's experience of care. The specific aim of this
      study was to determine whether a new patient-centered outcomes and coordinated-care
      management (PCCM) approach for sleep medicine provides better care and improves the health of
      patients compared to a conventional diagnostic/treatment outpatient medical care (CONV)
      approach.

      Patients were randomized to one of two arms; Conventional Diagnostic/Treatment Outpatient
      Medical Care (CONV) and Patient-Centered Outcomes and Coordinated-Care Management (PCCM).
      Randomization was conducted using a permuted block design. Each new patient consecutively
      seen at the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center and each patient seen at Stanford Sleep Clinic in
      Primary Care who were suspected of having a new sleep disorder were informed about the study.
      The patient was notified that the study was a randomized trial and he or she could be
      assigned to either the CONV or PCCM arms. The patient was also apprised that he or she was
      consenting to grant access all clinical data collected during his or her evaluation and
      treatment to the research team. If the patient agreed to participate, informed consent was
      obtained. He or she was then randomized to one of the study arms in order to diagnose and
      treat his or her sleep disorder.

    <description>Global rating of the provider from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Group Survey (CGCAHPS) compared between the two arms at end of study (12 months). The global rating instructions specify: &quot;Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst provider possible, and 10 is the best provider possible, what number would you use to rate this provider?&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The vitality scale score of the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Version 2 Health Survey was compared at the end-of study (12 months) and was derived from the following four questions: &quot;How much of the time during the past 4 weeks… Did you feel full of life?&quot; &quot;Did you have a lot of energy?&quot; &quot;Did you feel worn out?&quot; &quot;Did you feel tired?&quot; The possible responses and point values were: all of the time (1), most of the time (2), some of the time (3), a little of the time (4), and none of the time (5). The scale is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with the lower the score indicating more disability.</description>

        <description>Helpfulness of Provider's Use of Computers During a Visit (Effectiveness of technology as measured by the Health Information Technology item set of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Group Survey [CGCAHPS]). This included composite measures of helpfulness of provider's use of computers during a visit. The ratings for the following two questions were averaged for each participant: &quot;During your visits in the last 12 months, was this provider's use of a computer or handheld device helpful to you?&quot; The point values for the responses were: yes, definitely (1), yes, somewhat (2), and no (3). &quot;During your visits in the last 12 months, did this provider's use of a computer or handheld device make it harder or easier for you to talk with him or her?&quot; The point values for the responses were: easier (1), not harder or easier (2), harder (3).</description>

        <population>Although 1135 participants (574 CONV, 561 PCCM) completed at least one of the primary outcome measures, 423 CONV and 426 PCCM participant data were acceptable for statistical analysis for this outcome measure.</population>
