  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of ertugliflozin in participants with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The primary study
      hypothesis is that at Week 26, the mean reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for
      ertugliflozin is greater than that for placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial includes a 13-15 week run-in period prior to randomization, and a 26-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by a 78-week double-blind,
      extension period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 26 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride or basal insulin injected subcutaneously, and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

Up to 26 weeks, participants meeting glycemic rescue criteria were rescued with open-label glimepiride, and if they met rescue criteria again, and they were on maximal tolerated doses of glimepiride, they received basal insulin.

        <title>Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
        <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 26 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C (which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride or basal insulin injected subcutaneously, and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose at Week 26 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
        <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis. Blood was drawn at predose on Day 1 and after 26 weeks of treatment to determine change in plasma glucose levels (i.e., FPG at Week 26 minus FPG at Week 0) which is estimated on average for each treatment group using a constrained longitudinal data analysis model, which allows for participants with missing data to be included in the analysis. Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride or basal insulin injected subcutaneously, and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

        <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100.

          <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time. Percentage A1C is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin x 100. Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 52 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C. Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride or basal insulin injected subcutaneously, and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

          <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis. Blood was drawn at predose on Day 1 and after 104 weeks of treatment to determine change in plasma glucose levels (i.e., FPG at Week 104 minus FPG at Week 0). Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride or basal insulin injected subcutaneously, and dosed according to Investigator judgment. Per protocol, this data set excludes data for any participant after the initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure at Week 104 (Excluding Rescue Approach)</title>
        <description>This change from baseline reflects the Week 104 sitting SBP minus the Week 0 sitting SBP. Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with oral tablets of open-label glimepiride or basal insulin injected subcutaneously, and dosed according to Investigator judgment.

        <description>BMD at the femoral neck was assessed by DXA at Week 0 and Week 26. Participants who exhibited a significant reduction in BMD according to the protocol defined criteria completed an unscheduled DXA scan and, if required, received bone-active therapy.

Participants who exhibited a significant reduction in BMD according to the protocol defined criteria completed an unscheduled DXA scan and, if required, received bone-active therapy. This table excludes measurements obtained after initiation of bone rescue medications.</description>

      <desc>Participants who met pre-specified glycemic criteria were rescued with open-label glimepiride or insulin glargine according to Investigator judgment. The analysis population was all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product. Adverse events were reported for the all post-randomization follow-up period.</desc>

Up to 26 weeks, participants meeting glycemic rescue criteria were rescued with open-label glimepiride, and if they met rescue criteria again, and they were on maximal tolerated doses of glimepiride, they received basal insulin. After Week 26, non-rescued participants who had a fasting finger-stick glucose ≥110 mg/dL received blinded glimepiride. If a participant met glycemic rescue criteria after 26 weeks, and they were on maximal tolerated dose of glimepiride, then rescue with basal insulin was initiated.</description>
