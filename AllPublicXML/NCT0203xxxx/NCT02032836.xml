    <description>Part 1: Subjects received single inhalation of 1.25 mcg iloprost using 10 mcg/ml iloprost solution (Ventavis 10) and then 2.5 mcg iloprost using Ventavis 10, both using the FOX nebulizer on Day 1. Part 2: On Day 2, subjects received single inhalation of 5 mcg iloprost using Ventavis 10 with the I-Neb nebulizer; followed by single inhalation of 5 mcg iloprost using 20 mcg/ml iloprost solution (Ventavis 20) with the FOX nebulizer in a cross-over fashion. A washout period of at least 2 hours was maintained between treatments in Part 1 and Part 2. Part 3: Continued on Day 2, and through until Day 30, subjects received multiple inhalations (approximately 6 to 9 inhalations per day) of 5 mcg iloprost using Ventavis 10 with the I-Neb nebulizer for 2 weeks; followed by multiple inhalations (approximately 6 to 9 inhalations per day) of 5 mcg iloprost using Ventavis 20 with the FOX nebulizer for 2 weeks in a cross-over fashion.</description>

          -  Current diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (updated Dana Point Classification 1).

          -  Current inhalative therapy with 5 µg iloprost using the I-Neb nebulizer

          -  WHO functional class III at the time of the patient's commencement of inhalative
             therapy with iloprost

          -  Hemodynamic diagnosis of Pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) showing mean pulmonary
             arterial pressure (mPAP) &gt; 25 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) or left
             ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) &lt; 15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance
             (PVR) &gt; 320 dyn•s•cm-5

          -  If non-specific types of chronic treatment for PAH are being administered: Stable
             dosage of these for at least the 4 weeks up to screening

          -  If PAH-specific drug treatments (such as endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) or
             phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors) are being administered: Stable dosage of these
             for at least the 3 months up to screening.
