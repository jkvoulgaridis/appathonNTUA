    <measure>Percentage of the Gross Tumor Volume With a BTB Opening of Ktrans &gt; 0.005 Min-1</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Treatment, 1-2 Weeks Post Treatment (SRS), 1 Month Post Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Fifty metastatic lesions from 21 patients received WBRT and 14 lesions from 9 patients treated by SRS were analyzed. Permeability of BTB (Blood-Tumor-Barrier) was quantified by the transfer constant, Ktrans, derived from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI that were acquired pre, 1-2 weeks after starting, and 1-month post-radiotherapy. A percentage volume of the BM with Ktrans &gt;0.005 min-1 (%Vall) was used to evaluate the extent of BTB opening pre-RT and subsequent changes after receiving radiotherapy. The 50 lesions, from the 21 patients treated with Whole Brain Radiation Therapy, were divided into two subgroups: low-leaky (%Vall &lt;50%) and high-leaky, based upon pre-RT measurements. Of the 50 lesions, 7 were classified as low leaky and 43 were classified as high leaky. All 14 SRS lesions were classified as high leaky.</description>

        <title>Percentage of the Gross Tumor Volume With a BTB Opening of Ktrans &gt; 0.005 Min-1</title>
        <description>Fifty metastatic lesions from 21 patients received WBRT and 14 lesions from 9 patients treated by SRS were analyzed. Permeability of BTB (Blood-Tumor-Barrier) was quantified by the transfer constant, Ktrans, derived from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI that were acquired pre, 1-2 weeks after starting, and 1-month post-radiotherapy. A percentage volume of the BM with Ktrans &gt;0.005 min-1 (%Vall) was used to evaluate the extent of BTB opening pre-RT and subsequent changes after receiving radiotherapy. The 50 lesions, from the 21 patients treated with Whole Brain Radiation Therapy, were divided into two subgroups: low-leaky (%Vall &lt;50%) and high-leaky, based upon pre-RT measurements. Of the 50 lesions, 7 were classified as low leaky and 43 were classified as high leaky. All 14 SRS lesions were classified as high leaky.</description>
