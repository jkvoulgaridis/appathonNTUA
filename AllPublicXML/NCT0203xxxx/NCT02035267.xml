  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to explore the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous
      injections of Deoxycholic Acid relative to placebo, in the submental area in patients with
      mild or extreme fullness of the submental fat and ratings of 1 or 4.
