  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have indicated that determining prevalence and number of circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) at various time points during treatment may be an effective tool for assessing
      treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, even if the prognostic value
      of CTCs in MBC is well understood, the role of both CTC prevalence and CTC phenotype in
      predicting treatment response needs further investigation. DETECT IV is a prospective,
      multicenter, open-label, phase II study in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer and persisting HER2-negative circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Additional research on
      CTC dynamics and characteristics will provide a better understanding of the prognostic and
      predictive value of CTCs and is one step into a more personalized therapy for MBC.

             alimentation, prior surgical procedures af-fecting absorption (for example resection
             of small bowel or stomach), uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's
             disease, ulcerative colitis) and any other diseases significantly affecting
             gas-trointestinal function as well as inability to swallow and retain oral medication
             for any other reason.

        For Eribulin only:
