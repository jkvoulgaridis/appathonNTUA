  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of a new Cardiac Vascular
      Reconstruction (CAVAREC, Siemens Medical Systems, Germany) image reconstruction algorithm for
      use during transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) procedures or interventional procedures
      to treat congenital or structural heart disease. CAVAREC utilizes the same x-ray projection
      images as currently acquired for clinical DynaCT. X-ray image acquisition to allow CAVAREC
      will occur during the interventional procedure after the TAVI device, other valve, or stent
      is implanted. If the participants already have a surgically-implanted TAVI device, stent or
      other device, and are having a cardiac catheterization, then an extra set of images will be
      acquired after your clinical care is complete, but before you leave the procedure room. The
      CAVAREC image processing algorithm will be implemented on an off-line workstation after the
      interventional procedure is complete. After the TAVI procedure, CAVAREC images will be
      quantitatively and qualitatively compared to Siemens DynaCT and cardiac CT images from
      Radiology. The results of this study will be used to direct further development of CAVAREC
      toward the end goal of providing improved imaging capabilities to guide TAVI, congenital
      heart, or structural heart treatment procedures.

      1. Compare utility of CAVAREC to standard DynaCT and cardiac CT for clinical assessment of
           the aortic valve and relevant, nearby anatomical structures.

        2. Investigate the utility of CAVAREC to assess calcification within and surrounding the
           native aortic valve.

        3. Investigate the utility of CAVAREC to assess procedural success, including prosthetic
           valve placement and annular anatomic correlates of paravalvular leak.

        4. Validate utility of CAVAREC for images acquired during normal sinus rhythm.
