  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital herpes (GH) is a commonly occurring sexually transmitted disease caused by herpes
      simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2); both can
      cause GH, although the latter is much more likely to produce frequent recurrences of GH
      lesions. Evidence suggests that there are advantages to using suppressive vs. episodic
      treatment, which include increased intervals between the pain and discomfort of genital
      herpes recurrences. Therefore, this study will collect safety and efficacy data on
      suppressive therapy with valaciclovir in subjects newly diagnosed with HSV-2 genital herpes.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Time to First GH Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>Diary cards were issued to the participants during randomization visit for recording GH recurrences. HSV recurrences since the last visit was assessed after review of the diary card and discussion with the participant. The percentage of participants with time to first GH recurrence was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Confidence intervals for differences in proportions was calculated using the standard error for the Kaplan-Meier estimate derived using Greenwood's formula.</description>

    <measure>Mean Number of GH Recurrences Per Month Within the 6-month Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>Mean number of GH recurrence reaching macular/papular stage per month was reported. Diary cards were issued to the participants during randomization visit for the recording GH recurrences. HSV recurrences since the last visit was assessed after review of the diary card and discussion with the participant.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or medically significant.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Time to First Oral Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Outbreak Within 6-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>Diary cards were issued to the participants during randomization visit for recording HSV outbreak within 6-momths. HSV outbreak was assessed after review of the diary card and discussion with the participant. The percentage of participants who had first oral HSV outbreak at 6-months was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Isolates With Resistance to Acyclovir (ACV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>Culture samples were tested for AVC-susceptibility by the analytical laboratory. Re-testing of the ACV resistant isolates was carried out to check if the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50s) for all the ACV resistant isolates were within the expected errors of 2.0 microgram per milliliters (mcg/ml) cut-off for the plaque reduction assay. Those isolates that confirm to be resistant in repeat assays were considered as resistant to ACV.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in 74 centers in the Unites States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 384 participants with first recognized episode of genital herpes (GH) were randomized in this study, out of which one participant did not take the study medication, hence, the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 383 participants.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Participants received double blinded treatment of oral dose of matching placebo to valacyclovir 1 gram (g) given as 2 x 500 milligram (mg) caplets once daily (QD) for 6 months (24 weeks). Participants with GH recurrences during the study temporarily discontinued their blinded treatment assignment and received open label valaciclovir 500 mg twice a day (BID) for 3 days after which the double-blind therapy was resumed.</description>

          <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or medically significant.</description>
