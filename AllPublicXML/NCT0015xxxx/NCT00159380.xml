  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of oral and inhaled
      administration of L-arginine and of inhaled aminoguanidine on bronchial and alveolar exhaled
      NO and NO metabolites in exhaled breath condensate, saliva and nasal lavage fluid in normal
      and asthmatic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by a variety of cells within the respiratory tract,
      particularly airway epithelial cells, and its increased concentration in asthma is likely to
      derive from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expressed in inflamed airways. To evaluate whether
      an increased bronchial flux of NO (ie, airway wall NO flux [Jno] in picoliters per second)
      produced in the large airways is due to an enzyme overexpression, we administered a
      relatively selective iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, by nebulization in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled manner in asthmatic and healthy subjects and also investigated whether the
      same concentration of inhibitor has any effect on NO produced in the peripheral lungs (ie,
      alveolar NO concentration [Calv] in parts per billion [ppb]) or on the diffusing capacity of
      NO (Dno) [in picoliters per second−1 per ppb−1) in the airways. Aminoguanidine administration
      resulted in a significant reduction in Jno compared with administration of the saline
      solution control in eight healthy subjects and in eight patients with asthma but caused no
      significant changes in Calv or in Dno in either group.
