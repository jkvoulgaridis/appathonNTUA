  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An appropriate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response is required to survive
      critical illness. Primary adrenal insufficiency, relative adrenal insufficiency, tissue
      resistance to glucocorticoids, ACTH deficiency and immune-mediated inhibition of the HPA axis
      may impair the secretion or action of glucocorticoids in critically ill patients. Adrenal
      insufficiency is estimated to occur in up to 77% of critically ill patients, but currently,
      there is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for adrenal insufficiency in this setting,
      and standard testing does not discriminate among the aforementioned factors. We will study
      the incidence and natural history of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients to
      further define adrenal insufficiency and provide data to develop diagnostic tests. Clinical
      features and outcomes will be correlated with laboratory measurements of hormones, cytokines
      and glucocorticoid action. Healthy volunteers will undergo cortrosyn tests with measurement
      of free cortisol levels to develop a normative range for this endpoint.

      &lt;TAB&gt;

      Previous glucocorticoid use, if prolonged and supraphysiologic, also inhibits the HPA and can
      result in adrenal insufficiency. Patients with short intermittent courses of glucocorticoid
      administration have not been studied well, and may also be at risk. To gain further
      information about this group, patients receiving pulse glucocorticoid doses as part of bone
      marrow transplant regimens at the Clinical Center will also be studied.

      with known adrenal insufficiency will also be studied to help determine the clinical utility
      of diagnostic tests among these different groups. Previous glucocorticoid use, if prolonged
      and supraphysiologic, also inhibits the HPA axis and can result in adrenal insufficiency.
      Patients with short intermittent courses of glucocorticoid administration have not been
