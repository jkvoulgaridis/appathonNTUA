  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a growing trend amongst surgeons to use a construct for correction of
      scoliosis which involves segmental instrumentation with pedicle screws. Pedicle screw
      proponents cite greater curve control in all planes, which results in improved spinal curve
      correction. Some surgeons have noted due to the increased strength of the all screw
      construction that the rod is now the weak part of the spinal fixation. Although no evidence
      has been raised in regards to hardware failure there is a perception that a loss of balance
      in the sagittal plane is the result of flex in the titanium rod. A novel solution to the
      issue of rod flexibility is raised with the expedium super steel instrumentation which allows
      for greater stiffness than a 5.5 mm titanium rod with the same lower profile. This study aims
      to compare the new super steel technology with other established instrumentations used to
      correct spinal stenosis.
