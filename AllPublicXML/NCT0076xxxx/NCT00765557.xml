      We hypothesize fecal retention is the primary source of bladder dysfunction in some children
      with Urge Syndrome. Our specific aims are:

        1. To test this hypothesis through a prospective, randomized, double-blinded and
           placebo-controlled trial of laxatives for children diagnosed with US.

        2. To determine if a validated questionnaire of bowel activity administered to the family,
           and when appropriate, the patient, will identify those likely to benefit from laxative
           therapy for bladder dysfunction.

        3. To determine if the abdominal X-Ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB) assessment
           of fecal loading corresponds to answers on the questionnaire regarding incidence of
           constipation, and/or response to laxative therapy for US.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urge Syndrome (US) is the most common non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction in children beyond
      the usual age for toilet training, and is characterized by urinary frequency and urgency,
      holding maneuvers, and diurnal incontinence. Urodynamics testing has determined these
      symptoms result from uninhibited bladder contractions, and so anticholinergic drugs that
      control these contractions are the mainstay of therapy typically given in six month intervals
      until the condition resolves. Beyond the embarrassment that may accompany urinary
      incontinence, US has been linked to urinary tract infection (UTI) and vesicoureteral reflux.
      Specifically, among females with UTI, at least 40% also have US, and US has been identified
      as a cause for reflux and a factor that delays its otherwise expected spontaneous resolution.
      Consequently, identification and treatment of US are important to the management of children
      with UTI, reflux and/or incontinence.

      Constipation also has been associated with UTI, vesicoureteral reflux, and urinary
      incontinence in children. Although these observations date at least to the 1950s, relatively
      few studies have attempted either to establish the incidence of constipation found with these
      various pediatric urologic conditions, or to document the impact of bowel therapy upon their
      management. Of these, Yazbeck et al studied 47 children with recurrent UTI and noted all were
      constipated and had uninhibited bladder contractions during urodynamics testing. Therapy
      directed toward relief of constipation resolved bladder symptoms in 25%. Loening-Baucke
      reported 46% of 234 children attending a university-based encopresis clinic also experienced
      urinary incontinence, which diminished with laxative therapy. A recent evaluation of 582
      children with US estimated that 16% were also constipated based upon a history of bowel
      activity.

      We have been concerned about the apparent association between US and constipation, especially
      since anticholinergic drugs commonly prescribed for uninhibited bladder contractions could
      exacerbate underlying stool retention and thereby prolong bladder dysfunction. It is also our
      experience that parents are not very familiar with bowel activity of their children after the
      usual age of toilet training, making history potentially unreliable for diagnosing
      constipation. Therefore, we started recommending a brief course of laxatives for all patients
      presenting with US, reserving anticholinergics for those whose bladder symptoms persisted. In
      a retrospective review of 110 children, we found 34% had relief of bladder symptoms with
      laxatives alone, so that anticholinergic medications were not then required, and the history
      of whether the child was constipated or not did not predict response. However, this study has
      been criticized for not being placebo-controlled.

      Given the potential impact of this observation for the management of children with not only
      urinary incontinence but also UTI and reflux who have US, we now propose a prospective,
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of the impact of laxative therapy upon
      children with US.

      Agent/Device: Once the child has been screened and randomized, he/she will be given a 24-hour
      Voiding Diary to be started one day before the treatment. After the completion of the 24-hour
      voiding diary, the child will start taking the study medication (polyethylene glycol/placebo)
      as directed by age group for one month.

      After the child has taken the study medication (polyethylene glycol/placebo), he/she will
      fill out another 24-hour voiding diary and will come back to the clinic to be evaluated by
      the study doctor. The parent/guardian and/or the child will fill out the Bladder/Bowel
      Questionnaire again. Another abdominal X-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB) will
      be done as a standard of care procedure on the second clinic visit.

    <intervention_model_description>Only patients of investigators and sub-investigators will be recruited for this study. Children with urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, diurnal incontinence, UTIs and/or reflux validated by bladder/bowel symptom questionnaire to have Urge Syndrome (US) are eligible for this study. Standardized questionnaire of bowel/bladder activity will be given and a KUB obtained, standard of care, at entry to the study. A standard 1-day voiding diary will be completed at home before beginning therapy. Only subjects 4 years of age and older will be studied. Exclusion criteria also includes known neurological disorders, a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, bladder symptoms less than 6 months in duration at presentation, other bladder dysfunctions besides US, history of anorectal malformation, pregnancy and encopresis. Those accepted into the study will be randomized to receive either laxative or placebo once daily for one month.</intervention_model_description>
