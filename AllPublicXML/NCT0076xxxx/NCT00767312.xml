    <textblock>
      This study will determine if the level of virus in HIV-infected patients taking
      antiretroviral medications for prolonged periods decreases or persists at a stable level. It
      will also examine whether new gene changes (mutations) occur during drug suppression.

      HIV-infected patients who are 18 years of age or older, have been enrolled in another NIH
      protocol, have been suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and have very low levels of virus in
      their blood may be eligible for this 5-year (or more) study.

      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center about every 6 months for a physical examination,
      routine and research blood tests and leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for T cell
      analysis. For leukapheresis, blood is collected through a vein much like donating whole
      blood, but the blood is directed through a machine that separates and extracts the white
      cells and returns the rest of the blood components to the patient. Patients may also have an
      optional third clinic visit each year for another blood draw.

      Combination antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus serotype 1 (HIV-1)
      infection has resulted in profound reductions in viremia and is associated with marked
      improvements in morbidity and mortality. Therapy is not curative, however, and prolonged
      therapy is complicated by drug toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. How drug
      resistance emerges during suppressive antiretroviral therapy remains poorly understood.
      Investigating the characteristics of HIV-1 replication during suppressive antiretroviral
      therapy will yield important insights in understanding the emergence resistance, and requires
      patients who have suppressed viral RNA levels. Prior National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      protocols have made important observations regarding the kinetics of HIV-1 decline in
      response to therapy, the levels of HIV-1 viremia during suppressive therapy, and the nature
      of HIV-1 genetic diversity prior to and following initiation of antiretroviral therapy. In
      the process, these studies have generated a useful cohort of patients with suppressed viral
      RNA levels, who have been extensively characterized from a virologic and immunologic
      standpoint. Similarly, patients from other NIH protocols have been followed for prolonged
      periods before and after therapy has been initiated, and they also have stored sample sets
      that would be useful in new studies of HIV replication. The HIV Drug Resistance Program (DRP)
      has studied samples from protocols 00-I-0110 and 97-I-0082 to develop a number of new,
      sensitive laboratory techniques to measure and quantitate genetic variation and to
      investigate immune response parameters. To further advance understanding of HIV-1 replication
      during suppressive antiretroviral therapy and the emergence of drug resistance, we propose a
      new protocol to study these 2 patient cohorts (from the above cited protocols) and selected
      patients in other protocols with a new series of studies. The primary objective of this
      protocol is to investigate the virologic and immunologic characteristics of HIV-infected
      individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Upon implementation, this new protocol will
      provide human subjects protection for samples collected under the two prior protocols,
      whether patients enroll in the new study or not.

        Patients from studies: 00-I-0110 and 97-I-0082 are eligible for enrollment. Patients in
        other NIH studies would be considered for co-enrollment in this study if continued
        longitudinal sample acquisition is deemed desirable.
