        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD) requiring systemic therapy occurring &gt; 100 days
             after hematopoietic cell transplant with either:

               1. Persistent steroid dependence defined as the inability to taper steroid treatment
                  to less than 0.25 mg/kg/d prednisone or its equivalent for at least 3 months.

               2. Progression of cGVHD signs and symptoms on steroid therapy equivalent to
                  prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/d for at least 1 month.

          -  At least one of the following manifestations:

               1. Skin changes (rash, sclerosis, fasciitis, or ulceration).

               2. Abnormal eye wetness ≤ 5 mm as measured by Schirmer's test.

               3. Oral mucosal changes (erythema, lichenoid changes, ulcers, or mucoceles).

               4. Thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 50,000/uL).

               5. Abnormal liver function testing defined as alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, or
                  total bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN).

               6. Bronchiolitis obliterans (diagnosed by a &gt; 5% annual decline in FEV1 with the
                  lowest post-transplant FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.8 and an appropriate CT scan or lung biopsy).

          -  Has been on a fixed dose of steroids or a fixed dose of steroids and one other
             immunosuppressant (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or
             extracorporeal photopheresis) for ≥ 30 days before starting imatinib.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 3 50% (Appendix B).

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  If a female of reproductive potential (defined as having at least 1 menstrual period
             in the past 12 months), must have a negative pregnancy test performed ≤ 7 days before
             starting study drug.

          -  If a female of reproductive potential, agrees to use contraception for the duration of
             the trial.

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5X ULN.

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 500/uL (growth factor supplementation is allowed).

          -  Hematocrit &gt; 26% (transfusion support is allowed).

          -  Platelet count &gt; 20,000/uL.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Received another investigational agent ≤ 30 days before starting the study drug.

          -  Ongoing intercurrent illness such as an infection not responsive to antibiotics,
             antiviral medicines, or antifungal medicines.

          -  Progressive malignant disease.

          -  Secondary malignancy that has not been effectively treated within the past 5 years
             (except localized basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma).

          -  Imatinib intolerance or allergy.

          -  Participant is breast-feeding.

          -  Not willing to comply with treatment or response evaluation.

          -  Received an allogeneic cell product [including donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or
             hematopoietic cell boost] ≤ 100 days before starting study drug.

          -  Steroid and/or immunosuppressant dose has changed ≤ 30 days before starting study
             drug.
