  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of imipenem+cilastatin/relebactam (MK-7655A)
      versus colistimethate sodium+imipenem+cilastatin in the treatment of imipenem-resistant
      bacterial infections. Infections evaluated in the study will be hospital-acquired bacterial
      pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), complicated
      intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), and complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI).

Category 1 ECIs included post-baseline laboratory values of an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value that is ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and an elevated total bilirubin value that is ≥2x ULN and (at the same time) an alkaline phosphatase value that is ≤2x ULN. Category 2 ECIs included a confirmed elevated AST or ALT value that is ≥5x ULN. Statistical analysis included only Groups 1 and 2 as indicated by the protocol.</description>
