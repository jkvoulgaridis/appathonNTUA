    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lorvotuzumab mertansine works in treating younger
      patients with Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma,
      malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), or synovial sarcoma that has returned or
      that does not respond to treatment. Antibody-drug conjugates, such as lorvotuzumab
      mertansine, are created by attaching an antibody (protein used by the body?s immune system to
      fight foreign or diseased cells) to an anti-cancer drug. The antibody is used to recognize
      tumor cells so the anti-cancer drug can kill them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of IMGN901 (lorvotuzumab mertansine) in Wilms tumor,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and other cluster of differentiation (CD)56-expressing tumors
      such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and
      synovial sarcoma.

      II. To determine the tolerability of the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMGN901
      administered as an intravenous infusion, administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, to
      children with refractory Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, pleuropulmonary
      blastoma, MPNST, or synovial sarcoma.

      III. To define and describe the toxicities of IMGN901 administered on this schedule.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate tumor response with tumor CD56+ expression. II. To characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of IMGN901 in children with refractory cancer, including an assessment of
      impact on circulating CD56+ peripheral blood cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lorvotuzumab mertansine intravenously (IV) over 1-1.5 hours on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

        <title>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters of Lorvotuzumab Mertansine</title>
        <description>A descriptive analysis of PK parameters of lorvotuzumab mertansine will be performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit). Analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature.</description>

      <desc>AE reporting is collected routinely using case report forms. The SAE table reflects NCI CTCAEs submitted by the institution, via expedited reporting (NCI AdEERs/CAeRs). The “AE Other” table reflects all CTCAEs collected; excludes those reported as SAEs. Patients who did not receive treatment before being take off study were not included in the AE tables; per protocol, AE data was not collected for those patients. Ineligible patients were excluded from both the AE and All-Cause Mortality tables.</desc>
