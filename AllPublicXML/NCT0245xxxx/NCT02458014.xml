  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well blinatumomab works in treating patients with B-cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose disease is in remission (causes no symptoms or signs) but
      is still present in a small number of cells in the body (minimal residual disease).
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, may induce changes in the
      body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of blinatumomab in patients B-cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual disease (MRD) in
      terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by
      flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as
      well as safety of blinatumomab in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who do not proceed with stem cell transplantation may receive blinatumomab
      IV maintenance therapy with one cycle every 3 months for up to 4 cycles. Patients who remain
      in MRD remission for 3 months and then become MRD positive again can be retreated following
      the same treatment plan previously received.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

    <description>RFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Will compute the Bayesian posterior probability. As a secondary analysis, will perform a competing risk analysis treating stem cell transplant as a competing event for RFS. In addition, will assess the RFS in the subgroup of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity in at least marrow complete remission (CR) 2 beyond, or in the subgroup of patients with and without allogenic stem cell transplant (ASCT), if permitted by the sample size. Landmark analysis may be performed to assess the difference in RFS between patients with or without receiving ASCT, if permitted by the sample size.</description>
