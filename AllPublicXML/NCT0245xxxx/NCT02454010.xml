             care of the patient

          -  History of retinal degenerative disease, history of uveitis, history of retinal vein
             occlusion (RVO), or any eye condition that would be considered a risk factor for RVO

          -  Corticosteroid use within 2 weeks of study treatment

          -  Any other medical intervention or other condition which, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, could compromise adherence with study requirements or confound
             the interpretation of study results
