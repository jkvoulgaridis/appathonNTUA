  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A patient's sun-related behavior greatly influences the likelihood of that patient developing
      melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Prior research shows current educational
      strategies on inducing preventative behaviors such as wearing sun-protection clothing and
      wearing sunscreen are inadequate at effectively changing behavior when used in isolation --
      patients are aware of the dangers of not engaging in these preventative measures but forgo
      them nonetheless.

      The investigators are researching methods to positively influence skin cancer prevention
      behaviors among melanoma survivors and their families. The first objective of this study is
      to compare patient and familial sun exposure and cancer screening activity before and after a
      patient's diagnosis with primary melanoma. The second objective of this study is to note if
      hanging a &quot;Melanoma Survivor&quot; plaque in a melanoma survivor's bathroom will significantly
      affect the survivor's and broader family's sun exposure and cancer screening activity.

      The investigators' sample of patients consists of survivors of primary cutaneous melanoma
      less than 4.0 mm in depth who came through the Dermatology Clinic at Dartmouth-Hitchcock
      Medical Center and voluntarily chose to participate in the study after being informed of the
      nature of the research. These patients completed a confidential survey assessing sun exposure
      related activities immediately before and after their diagnosis. After the participants
      filled out the survey, the investigators asked the participants if they could nominate a
      family member to whom the investigators could explain the purpose of this research study to
      and confidentially ask an additional set of questions to evaluate the broader impact of a
      melanoma diagnosis. From the investigators' original sample, the investigators randomly chose
      a few families who would display the survivor plaque in their primary bathroom. After
      six-to-twelve months, during the each patient's follow up visit, the investigators asked the
      patient and the patient's nominated family member to fill out another survey to assess sun
      exposure related activity.

      On the surveys, no names were recorded. Everything was anonymous.

      This study is investigating a method to positively influence skin cancer prevention behaviors
      among melanoma survivors and their families. The first objective is to compare patient and
      familial sun exposure and cancer screening activity before and after a patient's diagnosis
      with primary cutaneous melanoma less than 4.0 mm in depth. It is believed that the diagnosis
      will positively affect behavior regarding skin cancer prevention as the diagnosis of melanoma
      makes the risk associated with sun-exposure and skin cancer a tangible issue. The second
      objective is to test whether receiving a &quot;Melanoma Survivor&quot; plaque and posting it in a
      melanoma survivor's bathroom will significantly affect the survivor's and broader family's
      sun exposure and cancer screening activity. Marketing research has shown similar techniques
      have been effective in causing individuals to consume goods (e.g. getting free pens with
      company logos makes you more likely to buy goods from that company), and the investigators
      think such techniques are transferable into the field of public health.

    <description>Subjects filled out a survey when they enrolled in the study assessing their skin cancer prevention behaviors. The investigators randomly gave some subjects a &quot;Melanoma Survivor&quot; plaque. After 6-12 months, the subjects again filled out a survey assessing their skin cancer prevention behaviors. The investigators analyzed the difference in each subject's responses to the same survey questions over time. The investigators then analyzed the difference between the responses of the subjects who saw the plaque and the subjects who did not see the plaque to discern the influence of the plaque on skin cancer prevention behaviors. Survey questions asked the patient and a family member of theirs to comment on patient and familial sun exposure and cancer screening activity. Subjects self-reported if the their behavior changed over time.</description>

        <title>Influence of a &quot;Melanoma Survivor&quot; Plaque on the Survivor's and Broader Family's Skin Cancer Prevention Activity.</title>
        <description>Subjects filled out a survey when they enrolled in the study assessing their skin cancer prevention behaviors. The investigators randomly gave some subjects a &quot;Melanoma Survivor&quot; plaque. After 6-12 months, the subjects again filled out a survey assessing their skin cancer prevention behaviors. The investigators analyzed the difference in each subject's responses to the same survey questions over time. The investigators then analyzed the difference between the responses of the subjects who saw the plaque and the subjects who did not see the plaque to discern the influence of the plaque on skin cancer prevention behaviors. Survey questions asked the patient and a family member of theirs to comment on patient and familial sun exposure and cancer screening activity. Subjects self-reported if the their behavior changed over time.</description>
