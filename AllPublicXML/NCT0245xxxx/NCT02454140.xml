  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of five fraction stereotactic
      radiotherapy (SBRT) in pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose of radiation under a fixed
      5-fraction SBRT regimen escalating the dose from 40 Gy in 5 fractions, to 60 Gy in 5
      fractions, at 5 Gy intervals.

    <measure>Local Tumor Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until local disease progression defined as a ≥20% increase in size on CT compared with CT prior to SBRT assessed over 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>local tumor control remains a crucial part of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer who are not candidates for curative therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant Metastatic Progression Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until the appearance of new lesions or a ≥20% increase in size on CT of the previously noted metastatic lesions assessed over 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence of distant metastatic failure will be determined for all patients treating death as a competing risk. In patients initially presenting with locally advanced disease, distant disease progression will be defined as the appearance of new metastatic lesions. In patients presenting with metastatic disease, distant progression will be defined as a ≥20% increase in size on CT of the previously noted metastatic lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of diagnosis and SBRT to date of death assessed over 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be measured from the date of diagnosis through death of any cause. Survival will also be reported from the date of SBRT for comparisons to other trials in the literature. Finally, survival will be stratified by those with locally advanced disease, and those with metastatic disease on presentation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis: Histologically-proven invasive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Disease Status: Medically unresectable (any stage), or locally advanced (stage III).

          -  Tumor Location: Primary tumor may be located anywhere in the pancreas.

          -  Treatment eligibility: The patient must be able to have fiducial markers implanted
             into the pancreatic tumor, and receive radiation regimen as specified in the protocol.

          -  Performance Level: Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60

          -  Adequate Renal Function Defined As: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Informed Consent: All subjects must sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or Breast-Feeding: Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on
             this study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic adverse events. (Note: Serum
             Pregnancy tests must be obtained in women of child bearing potential). Sexually active
             females may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
             method (such as abstinence, diaphragm, condom, or intrauterine device) to prevent
             pregnancy for the duration of the study.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months

          -  The patient cannot have had prior radiation therapy to the thorax or upper abdomen.

          -  Incarcerated individuals

          -  Subjects unable to give informed consent
