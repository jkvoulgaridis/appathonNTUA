  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For public health purposes disability is becoming increasingly important as an outcome
      measure. Despite this, there are few data on the effectiveness of adalimumab on disability
      outcomes in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), particularly in the
      Phase IV setting. There are even less data available in New Zealand, which did not have the
      opportunity to participate to a major extent in large, multinational, Phase III pivotal
      studies of adalimumab in IMIDs.

      The World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 is a simple,
      validated, free and easy-to-use generic assessment instrument for health and disability. It
      is applicable across cultures, in all adult populations. It is a responsive measure that can
      show what difference a treatment makes.

      Results from study of effect of adalimumab on WHODAS scores and other patient-reported
      outcomes (PROs) of work activity and well-being will be of interest to a variety of
      stakeholders in the healthcare system including patients, healthcare practitioners and
      payers.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>WHODAS 2.0 is a measures health and disability across cultures in all adult populations by assessing the same individual before and after the intervention across 12 items, covering the following 6 domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities and participation. Scores assigned to each of the items (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3, and extreme=4) are summed. Scores can range from 0 to 48. Persons scoring 10 to 48 are likely to have clinically significant disability.</description>

          <description>WHODAS 2.0 is a measures health and disability across cultures in all adult populations by assessing the same individual before and after the intervention across 12 items, covering the following 6 domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities and participation. Scores assigned to each of the items (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3, and extreme=4) are summed. Scores can range from 0 to 48. Persons scoring 10 to 48 are likely to have clinically significant disability.</description>

          <description>WPAI:GH is a 6-item questionnaire looks at the effect of health problems on ability to work and perform regular activities. The WPAI yields 4 types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes. The questionnaire specifies responses for the previous 7 days.</description>

          <title>Flourishing Scale</title>
          <description>The Flourishing Scale consists of eight items describing important aspects of human functioning ranging from positive relationships, to feelings of competence, to having meaning and purpose in life. Patients respond to the eight questions using responses varying between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree). For the scoring, the responses are added such that the range of scores is 8 (lowest possible) to 56 (highest possible). While there is no set cut point to define disability, a high score represents a person with many psychological resources and strengths.</description>

Persons scoring 10 to 48 are likely to have clinically significant disability.</description>
          <population>Participants with baseline and Month 4 assessments. Per protocol, primary and secondary endpoint data [other than the endpoints presented in Outcome Measures 4-6 and 14-16] were intended to be analyzed across all indications; therefore, data are presented for all participants as a single group.</population>

        <description>WPAI:GH is a 6-item questionnaire looks at the effect of health problems on ability to work and perform regular activities. The WPAI yields 4 types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes. The questionnaire specifies responses for the previous 7 days.</description>

          <description>WPAI:GH is a 6-item questionnaire looks at the effect of health problems on ability to work and perform regular activities. The WPAI yields 4 types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes. The questionnaire specifies responses for the previous 7 days.</description>

QoL is measured in 4 domains: bowel symptoms, emotional health, systemic systems and social function. Participants respond to questions ranging from 1=all of the time to 7=none of the time. Scores are added together, with higher scores indicating a better health-related QoL. Total scores range from 10 (poor QoL) to 70 (good QoL).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DLQI Score at Month 6 in Participants With Psoriasis</title>
        <description>The DLQI measures 10 items covering the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment, to determine how much the patients skin problem affected their life in the past week. Participants respond to the questions with 'very much,' 'a lot,' 'a little,' or 'not at all.' The scores are added together, and the impact on QoL is banded as follows: 0-1=no effect on participant's life; 2-5=small effect; 6-10=moderate effect; 11-20=very large effect; 21-30=extremely large effect.</description>
