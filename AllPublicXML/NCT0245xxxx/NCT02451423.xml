  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label Phase II study of MPDL3280A, an anti-PD-L1 antibody
      administered as neoadjuvant therapy to subjects with either BCG-refractory non-muscle
      invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, or muscle-invasive TCC appropriate
      for cystectomy and refusing or ineligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Enrolled patients
      will be assigned sequentially to dose levels in cohorts of 6 patients per dose level. The
      starting dose level is 1200mg x 1 dose and will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 1200mg
      q 3 weeks x 2 doses, and finally 1200mg q 3 weeks x 3 doses to determine the impact of
      increasing number of treatments on the modulated immune response with the tumor tissue.
      Subjects with adverse pathology (pT3/pT4 or N+) will be offered the option of adjuvant
      MPDL3280A for up to 16 cumulative cycles of treatment.

      After all neoadjuvant study therapy is administered, each subject will undergo cystectomy to
      evaluate pathologic response to treatment and for immunologic characterization in the
      resected tissue. Serum and urine will be obtained as well to characterize circulating immune
      responses. After the multi-dose portion of the study has completed accrual two expansion
      cohorts of up to 15 patients each with Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or
      Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) will be accrued at the highest dose
      level for further characterization of safety, efficacy, and immunologic analysis. Patients
      with pT3, pT4, or N+ disease at the time of cystectomy and no metastatic disease will be
      offered the option of adjuvant MPDL3280A for up to a total of 16 cumulative cycles. All
      subjects will be followed clinically for up to 2 years to assess for disease recurrence.

    <measure>Change in CD3+ T cell count/µm2 in the multi-dose cohorts</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The immunologic effect MPDL3280A activity within bladder tissue will be measured by a change in the CD3+ T cell count/µm2 between pretreatment biopsy and cystectomy tissue following MPDL3280A infusions. Tissue will be designated into 3 distinct compartments: benign epithelium, tumor centers, and tumor interfaces. Tumor interfaces will be defined as fields where malignant and benign epithelium are present. Cell count for each compartment will be reported in a table as mean for each of the 5 quantitated fields. For each cohort, change of T cell counts from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be calculated for each compartment as log2 of ratio of post-treatment vs. pre-treatment counts. Two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare difference of change from pretreatment to post-treatment between cohorts to assess if intratumoral immune response associated with increasing numbers of MPDL3280A treatments.</description>
