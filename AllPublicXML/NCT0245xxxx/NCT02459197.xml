    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline (Day-28 to Day-14) up to Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); the 11 NRS scale ranges from 0 (No pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine); the baseline APS (weekly mean of the daily average pain score) was computed on the 7 last days before Visit 2 with available APS values; similarly, the end-of-treatment APS (or APS Week 4) was computed on the 7 last days before Visit 4 with available APS values.</description>

    <measure>Patient's Change From Baseline of Pain Severity as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline (Day-28 to Day-14) up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>BPI is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function (Charles S. Cleeland © 2009). In the short form of BPI, there are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, actual pain and average pain in the past 24 hours. The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life. The interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).</description>

    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline (Day-28 to Day-14) up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>IGAC and PGAC are subjective evaluations using a NRS with 0 meaning &quot;best condition&quot; and 10 &quot;worst condition&quot;</description>

    <measure>For Osteoarthritic Patients Only: Patient's Change From Baseline of Osteoarthritic Physical Function, Pain and Stiffness as Assessed by Western Ontario and MacMaster (WOMAC) Scales From Baseline to End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Time zero equals baseline (Day-28 to Day-14) up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC (Bellamy et al., 1988) is a patient-rated instrument that measures OA symptoms.
The questionnaire contains 5 pain questions, 2 stiffness questions, and 17 physical function questions (24 questions total). Each question utilizes a 5-points Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) between 0-4; from 0=none to 4=extreme. Range of possible subscale scores: pain=0-20, stiffness=0-8 and physical function=0-68; higher scores for each subscale indicate worse outcomes.
The WOMAC was completed at each Visit except for Visit 5 by OA patients only.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are men or women of at least 18 years of age

          -  Diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (PNP) or knee or hip pain attributed to
             Osteoarthritis (OA) since at least 6 months

          -  Affiliated with national welfare

          -  Reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and
             are willing to follow study procedures

          -  Have given written informed consent approved by the relevant Ethics Committee (EC)
             governing the study sites

          -  Patients will be required to report pain with a score between 4 and 8 inclusive on the
             mean Average Pain Score (APS) during the baseline period preceding randomization and
             to have completed at least 10 days of pain assessments in their diary between Visit 1
             and Visit 2. If more than 10 days were completed, the mean APS will be calculated on
             the last 10 ones.

        Inclusion Disease Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis criterium for PNP: Patient with chronic PNP supported by a distinct
             neuroanatomical plausible distribution with sensory signs and symptoms, and
             consecutive to one of the following causes: a traumatic event, a surgical procedure
             (excluding limb amputation), radiculopathy, post- herpetic or post- zoster neuralgia,
             diabetic polyneuropathy or post chemotherapy. Diagnosis will have to be confirmed by
             the DN4 questionnaire at the screening visit (pain is considered as neuropathic if DN4
             score ≥ 4)

          -  Diagnosis criterium for OA: Patient with a unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee or
             hip diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria based
             on clinical and radiographic evidence (Altman et al. 1986). The clinical diagnosis of
             OA will be confirmed by the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification
             of idiopathic OA of the knee or hip based upon the following criteria:

               1. Knee or hip pain as an average at least half of the time for the last 3 months
                  before screening visit

               2. At least 1 of the following 3 conditions: Age &gt; 50 or morning stiffness &lt; 30
                  minutes or crepitus

               3. Kellgren and Lawrence grade &gt; 1 as assessed if possible by an X-ray of the
                  referred joint to confirm the diagnosis. If considered medically required by the
                  Investigator based on patient needs and as part of regular patient management, a
                  new anterior-posterior view X- ray should be obtained and reviewed by
                  Investigator or his delegates to verify that the patient meets the disease
                  diagnostic criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient changed his/her &quot; regular analgesic therapy &quot; for PNP or OA in the last 4

          -  Patient's regular analgesic treatment for PNP or OA consists of more than 2 different
             treatments, with neurostimulation being considered as an analgesic treatment for PNP.

          -  Patient reported unvariable APS and WPS scores between Visit 1 and Visit 2
             (systematically the same APS score and the same WPS score reported).

             self-management, hypnosis, sophrology, meditation program within 2 weeks prior to
             Visit 1 or during the study.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or willing to be pregnant within 3 months.

          -  Patients with a current or recent history, as determined by the Investigator, of
             severe, progressive, and/or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, or cerebral disease
             which would interfere with the patient's participation in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled epilepsy.

          -  Any current primary psychiatric condition, including depression or personality
             disorders (such as Axe II of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

        <title>Patient's Change From Baseline of Pain Severity as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</title>
        <description>BPI is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function (Charles S. Cleeland © 2009). In the short form of BPI, there are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, actual pain and average pain in the past 24 hours. The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life. The interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).</description>

        <title>For Osteoarthritic Patients Only: Patient's Change From Baseline of Osteoarthritic Physical Function, Pain and Stiffness as Assessed by Western Ontario and MacMaster (WOMAC) Scales From Baseline to End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The WOMAC (Bellamy et al., 1988) is a patient-rated instrument that measures OA symptoms.
The questionnaire contains 5 pain questions, 2 stiffness questions, and 17 physical function questions (24 questions total). Each question utilizes a 5-points Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) between 0-4; from 0=none to 4=extreme. Range of possible subscale scores: pain=0-20, stiffness=0-8 and physical function=0-68; higher scores for each subscale indicate worse outcomes.
The WOMAC was completed at each Visit except for Visit 5 by OA patients only.</description>
