  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well Regorafenib controls disease progression in urothelial cancer
      (cancer occurring in the urinary bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis) following previous
      therapy with chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) has a poor long-term prognosis. The disease has not seen
      improved outcomes despite research efforts in over two decades. Novel therapeutic options are
      needed. Regorafenib is a novel oral multikinase inhibitor but is more potent than a similar
      multikinase inhibitor drug that treats advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular
      carcinoma. Regorafenib has been shown to have a broader capacity to inhibit blood supply to
      tumor sources.

      This trial evaluates a proof-of-concept using Regorafenib in patients with metastatic
      progressive urothelial carcinoma following chemotherapy but still have a high level of
      activity performance in their daily living. The initial dose of Regorafenib will be 120 mg
      daily and then be escalated to 160 mg daily before gradually tapering.
