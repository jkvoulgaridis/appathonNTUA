  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try and achieve similar glycemic control in general
      non-Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) patients with Type 2 Diabetes with exenatide alone or in
      combination with basal insulin as compared to treatment with basal bolus insulin alone. The
      association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes is
      well established. Previous studies have shown that basal bolus insulin regimens improve
      glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospital complications compared to sliding scale
      regular insulin (SSRI) therapy, but has a significant risk of hypoglycemia. The investigators
      will compare the efficacy and safety of exenatide alone or in combination with basal insulin
      to control high blood glucose levels resulting in a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

    <textblock>
      The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes is
      well established. Data from previous trials in hospitalized patients have shown a strong
      association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes, such as mortality, morbidity,
      length of stay (LOS), infections and overall complications. Basal bolus insulin regimens
      improve glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospital complications compared to sliding
      scale regular insulin (SSRI). However, the use of basal bolus is labor intensive, requiring
      multiple daily insulin injections, and has a significant risk of hypoglycemia. The
      investigators will study if treatment with exenatide alone or in combination with basal
      insulin will result in similar glycemic control and a lower frequency of hypoglycemia than
      treatment with basal bolus in general non-Intensive Care Unit (non-ICU) patients with Type 2
      Diabetes.

Exenatide injections will be given within 60 minutes prior to morning and evening meals (or before the two main meals of the day, approximately 6 hours or more apart between doses). The exenatide dose will be increased to 10 mcg twice daily after 1 month based on clinical response.
