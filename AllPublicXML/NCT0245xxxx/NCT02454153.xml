    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial in people with diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea who
      will be randomly assigned for 3 months to PAP therapy along with healthy lifestyle and sleep
      education or healthy lifestyle and sleep education.

    <textblock>
      Research over the last decade has shown that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common
      condition in people with diabetes. Observational and experimental evidence also indicates
      that intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals in OSA may alter glucose metabolism and
      worsen glycemic control. However, the impact of treating OSA with positive airway pressure
      (PAP) therapy on glycemic variability and control is not well defined. Adequately powered
      randomized clinical trials have yet to be performed to demonstrate whether PAP therapy for
      OSA in diabetics can improve glycemic variability (and control), decrease blood pressure, and
      reverse endothelial dysfunction. The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether
      PAP therapy for OSA in diabetics leads to improvements in (a) glycemic variability as
      assessed by self-monitoring of blood glucose and continuous monitoring of glucose; (b)
      glycosylated hemoglobin; (c) blood pressure; (d) endothelial function; (e) serum and urinary
      biomarkers; and (f) dyslipidemia.
