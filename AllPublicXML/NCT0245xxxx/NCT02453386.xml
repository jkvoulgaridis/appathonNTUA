    <textblock>
      During Part A, each patient will participate for up to 30 weeks, which includes a Screening
      Period of 1 to ≤ 6 weeks, followed by a Baseline Visit and 24 weeks of double-blind
      treatment:

        -  Screening Period: 1 - 6 weeks.

        -  Double-Blind Treatment Period: 24 weeks.

      After completion of Part A, patients will continue in Part B for an additional 56 weeks:

        -  Open-Label Treatment Period: 52 weeks.

        -  Post-Treatment Safety Follow Up: 4 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Number of Hours Per Day Spent in OFF Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Awake time in OFF state (hr) is the average of maximum of 3 days diary. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in OFF time, where OFF time in the Hauser Parkinson's Disease Home Diary (PD) was averaged over 3 days prior to the study visit. During Screening and through Part A of the study, the Hauser Parkinson's Disease Home Diary (PD) was completed on specified days directly preceding the scheduled study visits/assessments. Motor activity was recorded as OFF, ON (mobility improved), or asleep time. Patients were asked to record ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;with non troublesome dyskinesia&quot; or &quot;with troublesome dyskinesia&quot;. Patients (and/or caregivers) were trained to complete the PD diary to record their status at half hourly intervals as OFF, ON without dyskinesia, ON with non troublesome dyskinesia, ON with troublesome dyskinesia, or asleep.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Good ON Time From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The first key secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in good ON which was defined as ON without dyskinesia or ON with non-troublesome dyskinesia.
Awake Time in Good ON State (hr) is the average of a maximum of 3 days diary. Patients were asked to record ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;with non troublesome dyskinesia&quot; or &quot;with troublesome dyskinesia&quot; . Patients (and/or caregivers) were trained to complete the PD diary to record their status at half hourly intervals as OFF, ON without dyskinesia, ON with non troublesome dyskinesia, ON with troublesome dyskinesia, or asleep. For patients with missing baseline or baseline was measured post-dose, screening was used as baseline in the calculation of change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Subscale + Part III Motor Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a scale to monitor Parkinson's Disease related disability and impairment. The scale itself has 4 components are titled; (1) nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), (2) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (3) motor examination (18 items), and (4) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. In this outcome measure we are evaluating Part II and Part III.
Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food Part III: clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation Range of score is 0 - 160: 0 meaning less impact and Higher score indicates greater impact of PD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the ON State in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part IIl</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts III Motor Function (motor subscale) total scores. Each subscale has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Range of score is 0 - 108. Higher scores indicate greater impact of PD symptoms. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in the ON state was measured at a time representative of the ON state in that patient, not in &quot;best&quot; ON. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III in OFF was not evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Global Assessments of Improvement: Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>For the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), the investigator or rater is asked to rate the patient's total improvement, whether or not in his or her judgment it is due entirely to drug treatment, based on a 1-7 point weighted scale ranging from &quot;very much improved&quot; (1) to &quot;very much worse&quot; (7). A zero score is assigned if the score is not assessed. Scale: 1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much worse, 7 = Very much worse. Tables show Treatment vs Placebo.</description>

    <description>For the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PG-I), the patient is asked to rate the total improvement of their Parkinson's Disease, whether or not in the patient's judgment it is due entirely to drug treatment, based on a 1-7 point weighted scale. &quot;very much improved&quot; (1) to &quot;very much worse&quot; (7). A zero score is assigned if the score is not assessed.
Scale: 1 = Normal, not at all ill, 2 = Borderline ill, 3 = Mildly ill, 4 = Moderately ill, 5 = Markedly ill, 6 = Severly ill, 7 = Among the most extremely ill.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Number of Hours Per Day Spent in OFF Time</title>
        <description>Awake time in OFF state (hr) is the average of maximum of 3 days diary. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in OFF time, where OFF time in the Hauser Parkinson's Disease Home Diary (PD) was averaged over 3 days prior to the study visit. During Screening and through Part A of the study, the Hauser Parkinson's Disease Home Diary (PD) was completed on specified days directly preceding the scheduled study visits/assessments. Motor activity was recorded as OFF, ON (mobility improved), or asleep time. Patients were asked to record ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;with non troublesome dyskinesia&quot; or &quot;with troublesome dyskinesia&quot;. Patients (and/or caregivers) were trained to complete the PD diary to record their status at half hourly intervals as OFF, ON without dyskinesia, ON with non troublesome dyskinesia, ON with troublesome dyskinesia, or asleep.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Number of Hours Per Day Spent in OFF Time</title>
          <description>Awake time in OFF state (hr) is the average of maximum of 3 days diary. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in OFF time, where OFF time in the Hauser Parkinson's Disease Home Diary (PD) was averaged over 3 days prior to the study visit. During Screening and through Part A of the study, the Hauser Parkinson's Disease Home Diary (PD) was completed on specified days directly preceding the scheduled study visits/assessments. Motor activity was recorded as OFF, ON (mobility improved), or asleep time. Patients were asked to record ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;with non troublesome dyskinesia&quot; or &quot;with troublesome dyskinesia&quot;. Patients (and/or caregivers) were trained to complete the PD diary to record their status at half hourly intervals as OFF, ON without dyskinesia, ON with non troublesome dyskinesia, ON with troublesome dyskinesia, or asleep.</description>

        <description>The first key secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in good ON which was defined as ON without dyskinesia or ON with non-troublesome dyskinesia.
Awake Time in Good ON State (hr) is the average of a maximum of 3 days diary. Patients were asked to record ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;without dyskinesia&quot;, &quot;with non troublesome dyskinesia&quot; or &quot;with troublesome dyskinesia&quot; . Patients (and/or caregivers) were trained to complete the PD diary to record their status at half hourly intervals as OFF, ON without dyskinesia, ON with non troublesome dyskinesia, ON with troublesome dyskinesia, or asleep. For patients with missing baseline or baseline was measured post-dose, screening was used as baseline in the calculation of change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Subscale + Part III Motor Function</title>
        <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a scale to monitor Parkinson's Disease related disability and impairment. The scale itself has 4 components are titled; (1) nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), (2) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (3) motor examination (18 items), and (4) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. In this outcome measure we are evaluating Part II and Part III.
Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food Part III: clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation Range of score is 0 - 160: 0 meaning less impact and Higher score indicates greater impact of PD symptoms.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts III Motor Function (motor subscale) total scores. Each subscale has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Range of score is 0 - 108. Higher scores indicate greater impact of PD symptoms. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in the ON state was measured at a time representative of the ON state in that patient, not in &quot;best&quot; ON.

        <description>For the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), the investigator or rater is asked to rate the patient's total improvement, whether or not in his or her judgment it is due entirely to drug treatment, based on a 1-7 point weighted scale ranging from &quot;very much improved&quot; (1) to &quot;very much worse&quot; (7). A zero score is assigned if the score is not assessed. Scale: 1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much worse, 7 = Very much worse. Tables show Treatment vs Placebo.</description>

Scale: 1 = Normal, not at all ill, 2 = Borderline ill, 3 = Mildly ill, 4 = Moderately ill, 5 = Markedly ill, 6 = Severly ill, 7 = Among the most extremely ill.
Tables show Treatment vs Placebo.</description>
          <population>mITT population (Modified Intent-to-Treat) - all safety set patients who had valid diaries at baseline and had valid diaries on at least 1 post-baseline visit. Patients were accounted for in the treatment group to which they were originally randomized.</population>
