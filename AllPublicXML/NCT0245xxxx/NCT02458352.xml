    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the CACS obtained from standard dose CT to the CACS
      obtained from ultra-low-dose scans. Additionally, the usefulness of ultra-low-dose CT for AC
      of myocardial perfusion SPECT will be assessed.

    <measure>Agreement and Correlation of Coronary Artery Calcium Score Obtained From Ultra-low-dose and Standard CT</measure>
    <time_frame>1 days</time_frame>
    <description>CAC and BA limits of agreement between coronary artery calcium score obtained from ultra-low-dose and standard CT.
Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a measure for quantification of coronary artery calcification based on non-contrast enhanced CT, ranging from 0 (no calcifications) to infinite. It is an arbitrary unit. Increasing CAC means higher amounts of coronary artery calcifications and is associated with worse prognosis.
Bland-Altman (BA) analysis is a statistical method to compare two modalities or techniques assessing the same measure. Limits of agreement is defined as +/- twice the standard deviation of the differences between the reference method and the new modality/technique. Broader limits of agreement mean less accurate results obtained by the new modality/techniqe, while a 0 BA limit of agreement would theoretically reflect perfect agreement.</description>

    <measure>Intra-class Correlation Coefficient Between Segmental Relative Tracer Uptake From SPECT Datasets Reconstructed With AC Maps Based on Ultra-Low-Dose and Standard Dose CT</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>For every patient, the CT images from 120 and 70 kVp-CT scans were used to create CTAC maps which were then used to reconstruct SPECT images, displayed as a 17-segment model polar plot with normalized percent tracer uptake given for every segment. Intra-class correlation was then applied to compare segmental relative tracer uptake. Analysis and the resulting correlation coefficient of 0.987 basically demonstrates interchangeability between the two datasets.</description>
