      Title of Study:

      An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Two-Stage, Multicenter, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy

      Phase of development:

      Phase II

      Plan to enroll 44 subjects

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, two-stage, multicenter study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Lipotecan® monotherapy in subjects with poorly differentiated
      neuroendocrine carcinomas. Only those subjects who have failed to first line chemotherapy
      (Etoposide plus platinum) due to treatment intolerance or radiographic progressive disease
      (PD), as per RECIST v1.1, are eligible to participate in the study. The scheduled assessments
      should be performed as identified on a calendar schedule, and should not be affected by
      delays in therapy, drug holidays or any other events that might be lead to imbalance in a
      treatment arm in the timing of disease assessment. Efficacy results are based on radiographic
      assessments reviewed by the investigator.

      Eligible subjects will receive 40 mg/m2 of Lipotecan®, given as a 30 (+3) minute intravenous
      infusion, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle until PD, unacceptable toxicity or consent
      withdrawal occurs.

    <description>The Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of subjects who have a best-response rating of CR or PR or SD (DCR= CR+PR+SD) (according to RECIST v1.1) when assessed after every 8 weeks of study drug (up to 6 cycles) and maintained for at least 28 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival will be calculated as the duration between the first date of randomization and the date of disease recurrence or progression according to RECIST v1.1 (failed), taking the status of tumor at the treatment has been completed as the reference, or death (failed), or the date of withdrawal (last contact date, censored), or the scheduled data analysis date (censored).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>

    <description>Overall survival will be calculated from the date of randomization to either the date of death from all causes, or to the date of withdrawal (last contact date, censored), or to the scheduled data analysis date (censored).</description>
