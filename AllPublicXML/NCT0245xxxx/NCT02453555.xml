    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 24 was calculated as: HbA1c at Week 24 - HbA1c at baseline. Baseline is referred to the last observed measurement prior to the administration of randomized trial medication. Adjusted mean (Least square mean) and its standard error (SE) is presented.</description>

    <measure>Change in HbA1c From Week 28 at Week 52 (Empagliflozin 25 mg/Linagliptin 5 mg Only)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Week (pre up-titration) and 52 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Week 28 in HbA1c at Week 52 was calculated as: HbA1c at Week 52 - HbA1c at Week 28. Week 28 (pre up-titration) is referred to the last observed measurement prior to the first administration of any double-blind randomized trial medication in the up-titration period. Adjusted mean (Least square mean) and its standard error (SE) is presented.
This endpoint was based on 1 group of the Full analysis set with up-titration (FASUT-II) whose dose was up-titrated to Empagliflozin 25 mg/Linagliptin 5 mg fixed dose combination thus there is no comparison group. Hence, no comparison is made. A restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach was used with baseline HbA1c as linear covariate and baseline eGFR, prior use of antidiabetic drug, visit as fixed effect(s). The covariance used to fit the model was unstructured.</description>

             interfere with trial participation or any ongoing condition leading to a decreased

             investigator

         16. Intake of an investigational drug in another trial within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or
