    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and
      everolimus work in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer with tumors predicted
      insensitive to standard chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from
      dividing.Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab binds to VEGF receptor, thus halting
      vessel growth in the tumor and thereby causing cell death. Everolimus may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin together with bevacizumab and everolimus may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine excellent clinical response rates (pathologic complete response [pCR]/residual
      cancer burden [RCB]-0 or minimal residual disease [RCB-I]) in patients with
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy insensitive, localized triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      who receive 4 cycles of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bevacizumab, and
      everolimus (DAE) following anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine response rate after 4 cycles of DAE using radiographic imaging. II. Correlate
      pathologic response with vimentin expression as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      III. Determine toxicity associated 4 cycles of DAE in the neoadjuvant setting. IV. Compare
      pathologic response rates to 4 cycles of DAE in mesenchymal tumors versus (vs.)
      non-mesenchymal tumors.

      V. Compare pathologic response rates in mesenchymal tumors to 4 cycles of DAE vs. 12 weeks of
      weekly paclitaxel.

      VI. Determine pathologic response rates for all patients who discontinue study drug due to
      toxicity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the correlation between vimentin expression by IHC and the presence of
      mesenchymal gene signatures at the time of initial tumor biopsy prior to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NACT).

      II. Determine rates of pCR in patients with mesenchymal tumors identified by gene signatures
      and compare to pCR rates in non-mesenchymal tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over about
      3 hours on day 1, bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1, and everolimus orally (PO) daily.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients will not receive bevacizumab during course 4 of therapy.
      Patients then undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-3 weeks.

    <description>Potential biomarkers of response will be correlated with pathologic response to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bevacizumab, and everolimus using appropriate statistical analyses for the biomarker of interest. For genomic mutations, multivariate logistic regression models will be fitted to the data that include three explanatory variables; namely dichotomous variables for treatment (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bevacizumab, and everolimus versus paclitaxel), gene mutation, and the interaction. The interaction will be examined to investigate if excellent pathologic response (residual cancer burden-0 or 1) due to a therapy is associated with gene mutation status. Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt; 0.05.</description>
