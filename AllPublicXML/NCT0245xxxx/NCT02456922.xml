    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective single-sample correlational design
      without controls. A total of up to 310 previously-diagnosed type 1 or 2 diabetes subjects
      will be enrolled in order to have 160 subjects complete frequent sample testing at up to 17
      centers. Subjects will wear Harmony 1 sensors used with the Guardian Mobile application.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 2-75 years of age at time of screening

          -  A clinical diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months duration as
             determined via medical record or source documentation by an individual qualified to
             make a medical diagnosis

          -  Adequate venous access as assessed by investigator or appropriate staff

          -  Subjects participating in the high and low glucose challenges must have an established
             insulin carbohydrate ratio(s) and insulin sensitivity ratio. (The term &quot;established&quot;
             refers to a ratio that has been previously defined and tested prior to screening
             visit). Subjects without established ratios may participate under observation only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject will not tolerate tape adhesive in the area of Harmony 1 Sensor placement as
             assessed by qualified individuals

          -  Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of Harmony 1 Sensor or
             device placement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)

          -  Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein
             they have received treatment from an investigational study (drug or device) in the
             last 2 weeks

          -  Subject is female and has a positive pregnancy screening test

          -  Females of child bearing age and who are sexually active should be excluded if they
             are not using a form of contraception deemed reliable by investigator

          -  Subject is female and plans to become pregnant during the course of the study

          -  Subject has had a hypoglycemic seizure within the past 6 months

          -  Subject has had hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness within the past 6
             months prior to screening visit

          -  Subject has had an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) within the past 6 months
             prior to screening visit.

          -  Subject has a history of a seizure disorder

          -  Subject has central nervous system or cardiac disorder resulting in syncope

          -  Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery
             bypass surgery, coronary artery stenting, transient ischemic attack (TIA),
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA), angina, congestive heart failure, ventricular rhythm
             disturbances or thromboembolic disease

          -  Subject has a hematocrit (Hct) lower than the normal reference range

          -  Subject has a history of adrenal insufficiency
