  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot randomized controlled clinical trial of intermittent use of two different vaginal
      lactobacilli-containing probiotics, and oral metronidazole, to prevent bacterial vaginosis
      recurrence.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to prepare for larger clinical trials. Sixty-eight HIV-negative,
      non-pregnant, sexually active women aged 18-45 with bacterial vaginosis (BV, by modified
      Amsel criteria and/or Nugent score) and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV, on wet mount or by
      culture) will be treated using oral metronidazole for 7 days. After successful treatment, and
      when they are free of vaginal candidiasis, other curable sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs) and urinary tract infection (UTI)), they will be randomised to 4 different vaginal
      microbiome (VMB) maintenance interventions (17 per group) within 3 days of completing oral
      metronidazole treatment: 1) Behavioral 'vaginal practices cessation and safer sex'
      counselling only (control); 2) Behavioral counselling plus 500mg metronidazole pills twice
      per week for two months; 3) Behavioral counselling plus Ecologic Femi vaginal capsule, once
      per day for 5 days immediately after oral metronidazole treatment followed by thrice weekly,
      for two months; 4) Group 4: Behavioral counselling plus Gynophilus vaginal tablet, once every
      4 days for two months. Vaginal probiotic use may be ceased temporarily during menstruation.
      Participants will be asked to adhere to the interventions for 2 months, and VMB assessments
      will take place before (screening and enrolment visits), during (Day 7, Month 1 and Month 2
      visits), and after the interventions (Month 6 visit).

    <measure>Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Incidence by Modified Amsel Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Amsel criteria positive is at least 2 of 3 of the following positive: clue cells, vaginal pH, whiff test.
Modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses (women with Nugent 7-10 at enrollment excluded), using person-years (PY) at risk as denominator of each incidence rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Incidence by Nugent Scoring (Nugent 7-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nugent score is a scale from 0-10 based on visualisation of three different bacterial morphotypes on a Gram stained slide, but in the incidence rates, the variable was used as a binary variable: BV present (Nugent score 7-10) or absent (Nugent score 0-6). Modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses (women with Nugent 7-10 at enrollment excluded), using person-years (PY) at risk as the denominator for each incidence rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trichomonas Vaginalis (TV) Incidence by Culture</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>A swab was inoculated into an InPouch culture pouch, specifically designed for TV growth. The pouch was checked daily for five days to detect growth. The results was positive when growth detected and negative when no growth detected on the fifth day.
Intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, using person-years (PY) at risk as the denominator for each incidence rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaginal Candidiasis Incidence by Wet Mount Microscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months: 2 months intervention period plus 4 months after intervention cessation</time_frame>
    <description>A wet mount is a smear of vaginal fluid on a microscopy slide, which is examined under a microscope. Yeasts are visible without staining. The definition of vaginal candidiasis was any yeast visible on the wet mount. Symptomatic vaginal candidiasis was considered a safety outcome because treatment of bacterial vaginosis often results in vaginal candidiasis. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis with person-years (PY) at risk as the denominator of all incidence rates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaginal Microbiota Composition by Illumina HiSeq Sequencing: Lactobacillus Genus Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>The vaginal microbiota sequencing results are exploratory and full data can be found in a manuscript on the BioRxiv preprint server. The most important outcome is the concentration of Lactobacillus genus in vaginal samples taken at the end of the intervention period (M2 visit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility/Acceptability of Vaginal Probiotic Use by Structured Face-to-face Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>Full results have been submitted for publication. Adherence was measured at D7, M1, and M2 visits, and a summary measure over the entire period was calculated (available for women using oral metronidazole, Ecologic Femi+, or Gynophilus LP). After the 2-month intervention period, women using vaginal probiotics (Ecologic Femi+ or Gynophilus LP) were asked structured questions about their experiences with product use.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The target population was women at high risk of urogenital infections living in Kigali, Rwanda. Recruitment activities were implemented by study staff with the help of Community Mobilizers, who were selected due to their strong connections with high-risk women in Kigali. They helped staff organize recruitment meetings in relevant communities.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At the end of the screening process, women were either ineligible or diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (by modified Amsel criteria and/or Nugent score) and/or trichomoniasis (by culture or wet mount) and treated with 500 mg oral metronidazole 2x/day for 7 days. An enrollment visit was scheduled within three days after treatment completion.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Vaginal Candidiasis Incidence by Wet Mount Microscopy</title>
        <description>A wet mount is a smear of vaginal fluid on a microscopy slide, which is examined under a microscope. Yeasts are visible without staining. The definition of vaginal candidiasis was any yeast visible on the wet mount. Symptomatic vaginal candidiasis was considered a safety outcome because treatment of bacterial vaginosis often results in vaginal candidiasis. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis with person-years (PY) at risk as the denominator of all incidence rates.</description>
