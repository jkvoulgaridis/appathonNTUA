  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening tool will be used to identify significant relations of patients with advanced
      medical illness or serious hospitalization and family individuals who lost their loved one
      and who could use professional support in the future. We are interested in enrolling family
      members or close friends of patients with advanced medical illness as well as family members
      or close friends who have lost a loved one. Some screening tools to identify family members
      who might need support do exist, but the investigators are hoping to develop one that is
      brief and easier for healthcare providers to use. The information learned in this study will
      help us refine the screening tool. Family member input will be essential in the development
      of this screening tool.

             member completing the study questionnaires, the family member will be eligible for
