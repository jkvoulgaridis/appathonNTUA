      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Dysport for the improvement in
      appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines and to assess the short term and long term
      safety of Dysport, used for the improvement in appearance of moderate to severe glabellar
      lines in Chinese subjects.

    <textblock>
      The first treatment cycle will be double blind and subjects will be randomised to receive
      Dysport, Botox or placebo. After the first treatment cycle, all subjects will receive a
      maximum of four treatment cycles with Dysport, occurring at intervals of no less than 84 Days
      (12 weeks) between each treatment cycle, depending upon individual duration of response to
      Dysport treatment.

      <recruitment_details>This was a multicentre, phase III, randomised, double-blind (DB) then open-label (OL) study. The 12 month recruitment period began in April 2015. A total of 555 subjects were screened across the 10 study centres in China and 520 subjects were randomised into the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The 35 screen failures were due to 17 subjects not meeting the eligibility criteria, 17 subjects withdrawing consent, and one subject reporting an adverse event.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Dysport® 50 Units (U) - DB Period</title>
          <description>Subjects randomised to the Dysport® treatment group in Cycle 1 received on Day 1, 50 U (0.25 millilitres [mL]), divided into five injections into the glabellar area. 10 U (0.05 mL) of Dysport® was administered intramuscularly, at right angles to the skin into each of the five injection sites. The Investigator was blinded with respect to treatment injection.
Following treatment administration, all subjects attended follow-up visits on Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycle 1. On Day 85, subjects were assessed for their eligibility to enter the OL period (Cycles 2 to 5). Any subjects not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study. A subject was considered to have completed the study in Cycle 1 if they were not eligible for retreatment and had completed a total of 15 months follow-up following study treatment administration on Day 1.</description>

          <description>After the first treatment cycle, all eligible subjects entered the OL period and received Dysport® 50 U (0.25 mL), injected into five predefined sites across the glabellar region. 10 U (0.05 mL) of Dysport® was administered intramuscularly, at right angles to the skin into each of the five injection sites per treatment cycle.
Subjects received a maximum of four treatment cycles (Cycles 2 to 5) with Dysport®. These cycles occurred at intervals of no less than 84 days (12 weeks) between each cycle, depending upon individual duration of response to Dysport® treatment. Any subjects not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study.</description>

        <title>Superiority Analysis of The Percentage of Responders Measured by the Investigator's Live Assessment (ILA) at Maximum Frown at Cycle 1, Day 29 (DB Period).</title>
        <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and at Cycle 1, Day 29, the Investigator assessed the appearance of the glabellar lines at maximum frown using a validated 4-point Photographic Scale of Glabellar Line Severity. This 4-point scale rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at Cycle 1, Day 29, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at maximum frown at baseline.
Superiority analysis of active treatment versus placebo was carried out using a multivariate logistic regression model and adjusted for the stratification factors of gender and baseline severity score of glabellar lines at maximum frown measured by the ILA. The adjusted percentage of responders is presented for Cycle 1, Day 29.</description>
        <time_frame>At Cycle 1, Day 29.</time_frame>
        <population>The modified Intent-to-treat (mITT) population was all randomised subjects who received study treatment in at least one injection site regardless of the amount administered and had both the baseline and Cycle 1, Day 29 assessments, for the ILA and subjects' self assessment (SSA) of glabellar lines at maximum frown.</population>

          <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and at Cycle 1, Day 29, the Investigator assessed the appearance of the glabellar lines at maximum frown using a validated 4-point Photographic Scale of Glabellar Line Severity. This 4-point scale rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at Cycle 1, Day 29, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at maximum frown at baseline.
Superiority analysis of active treatment versus placebo was carried out using a multivariate logistic regression model and adjusted for the stratification factors of gender and baseline severity score of glabellar lines at maximum frown measured by the ILA.

          <title>The Percentage of Responders With Respect to Independent Reviewer's Assessment of Photographs of the Subject's Glabellar Lines at Maximum Frown at Cycle 1, Day 29 (DB Period).</title>
          <description>Photographs of the glabellar region of subjects were taken at maximum frown at baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and at Cycle 1, Day 29. Photographs were assessed by an Independent Experts Committee using a validated 4-point Photographic Scale of Glabellar Line Severity which rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). The median of three readings by three independent reviewers was used in the analysis. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at Cycle 1, Day 29, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at baseline.
Superiority analysis of active treatment to placebo was carried out using a multivariate logistic regression model and adjusted for the stratification factors of gender and baseline severity score of glabellar lines at maximum frown measured by the ILA. The adjusted percentage of responders is presented for Cycle 1, Day 29.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders Measured by the ILA at Maximum Frown at Cycle 1 Study Visits (DB Period).</title>
        <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and at all subsequent study visits, the Investigator assessed the appearance of the glabellar lines at maximum frown using a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity. This 4-point scale rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at any given visit, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at baseline.
Superiority analysis of active treatment versus placebo was carried out using a multivariate logistic regression model and adjusted for the stratification factors of gender and baseline severity score of glabellar lines at maximum frown measured by the ILA. The adjusted percentage of responders is presented for all visits up to Day 85 in the DB period (except Cycle 1, Day 29).</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Cycle 1, Day 85.</time_frame>
        <population>The mITT population was all randomised subjects who received study treatment in at least one injection site regardless of the amount administered and had both the baseline and Cycle 1, Day 29 assessments, for the ILA and SSA of glabellar lines at maximum frown.

        <title>The Percentage of Responders Measured by the ILA at Rest at Cycle 1 Study Visits (DB Period).</title>
        <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and at all subsequent study visits, the Investigator assessed the appearance of the glabellar lines at rest using a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity. This 4-point scale rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at rest at any given visit, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at rest at baseline.
Superiority analysis of active treatment versus placebo was carried out using a multivariate logistic regression model and adjusted for the stratification factors of gender and baseline severity score of glabellar lines at maximum frown measured by the ILA. The adjusted percentage of responders is presented for all visits up to Day 85 in the DB period (except Cycle 1, Day 29).</description>

        <population>The mITT population was all randomised subjects who received study treatment in at least one injection site regardless of the amount administered and had both the baseline and Cycle 1, Day 29 assessments, for the ILA and SSA of glabellar lines at maximum frown.

        <title>The Percentage of Responders With Respect to the SGA Score at Cycle 1 Study Visits (DB Period).</title>
        <description>On all study visits, subjects were asked to assess the change, since the last treatment administration, in the appearance of their glabellar lines using the following 9-point Global Assessment Scale: +4 =100% improvement; +3 =75% improvement; +2 =50% improvement; +1 =25% improvement; 0 =no change; -1 =25% worsening; -2 =50%worsening; -3 =75% worsening; -4 =100% worsening. A responder, based on the SGA scale, was defined as having a grade of at least +2 (50% improvement).
Superiority analysis of active treatment versus placebo was carried out using a multivariate logistic regression model and adjusted for the stratification factors of gender and baseline severity score of glabellar lines at maximum frown measured by the ILA. The adjusted percentage of responders is presented for all visits up to Day 85 in the DB period (except Cycle 1, Day 29).</description>

        <title>The Time to Onset of Treatment Response Based on the Subject's Diary Card (DB Period).</title>
        <description>Subjects were given the diary card at baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1 ) and asked to record their assessment of study treatment response for the first 7 days post-treatment (Days 2 to 8). They were asked to respond 'yes' or 'no' to the following question: 'Since being injected have you noticed an improvement in the appearance of your glabellar lines (lines between your eyebrows)?' Subjects with no treatment response were censored at the date of last assessment of treatment response recorded in the diary card.
The 50th percentile of Kaplan-Meier estimates was used to estimate the median time to onset of treatment response for each treatment group.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders Measured by the SSA at Maximum Frown at All Other Study Visits (OL Period).</title>
        <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and all subsequent study visits per treatment cycle in the OL period, subjects assessed the appearance of their glabellar lines at maximum frown using a 4-point categorical scale. The 4-point scale represents the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (no wrinkles), Grade 1 (mild wrinkles), Grade 2 (moderate wrinkles) and Grade 3 (severe wrinkles). For the SSA, a responder was defined as having a severity grade of no wrinkles (0) or mild wrinkles (1) at maximum frown at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate wrinkles (2) or severe wrinkles (3) at maximum frown at baseline.
The proportion (percentage) of responders measured by SSA at all study visits in Cycle 2 to 5 is presented.</description>

            <description>All subjects who were eligible for retreatment following the DB period entered Cycle 2 and received OL Dysport® 50 U. The total treatment dose was injected in 5 predefined sites across the glabellar region on Cycle 2, Day 1.
Following treatment administration, all subjects attended follow-up visits on Days 8, 29, 57, and 85 of Cycle 2. Subjects were assessed for the eligibility to receive the next treatment cycle from Day 85.
Any subjects who were not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study. A subject was considered to have completed the study when they had either received a total of five study treatment injections or completed a total of 15 months follow-up in the study following the first study treatment administration and completed the Day 85 visit following the last injection.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders Measured by the ILA at Rest at All Study Visits (OL Period).</title>
        <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and all subsequent study visits per treatment cycle in the OL period, the Investigator assessed the appearance of the glabellar lines at rest using a validated 4-point Photographic Scale of Glabellar Line Severity. This 4-point scale rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at a given visit, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at baseline. Subjects with a baseline score of 0 or 1 were excluded from the analysis of responders. The proportion (percentage) of responders measured by ILA at all study visits per treatment cycle in in the OL period is presented.</description>

          <title>The Percentage of Responders Measured by the ILA at Rest at All Study Visits (OL Period).</title>
          <description>At baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and all subsequent study visits per treatment cycle in the OL period, the Investigator assessed the appearance of the glabellar lines at rest using a validated 4-point Photographic Scale of Glabellar Line Severity. This 4-point scale rated the severity of glabellar lines as Grade 0 (none), Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe). A responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1 at a given visit, and a severity grade of 2 or 3 at baseline. Subjects with a baseline score of 0 or 1 were excluded from the analysis of responders. The proportion (percentage) of responders measured by ILA at all study visits per treatment cycle in in the OL period is presented.</description>

        <title>The Proportion of Responders With Respect to the SGA Score at All Other Study Visits (OL Period).</title>
        <description>On each study visit per treatment cycle in the OL period, subjects were asked to assess the change, since the last treatment administration, in the appearance of their glabellar lines using the following 9-point Global Assessment Scale: +4 =100% improvement; +3 =75% improvement; +2 =50% improvement; +1 =25% improvement; 0 =no change; -1 =25% worsening; -2 =50%worsening; -3 =75% worsening; -4 =100% worsening.
A responder, based on the SGA scale, was defined as having a grade of at least +2 (50% improvement). The proportion (percentage) of responders at each study visit on Day 8 to Day 85 in the OL period is presented.</description>

            <description>All subjects who were eligible for retreatment following the DB period entered Cycle 2 and received OL Dysport® 50 U. The total treatment dose was injected in 5 predefined sites across the glabellar region on Cycle 2, Day 1.
Following treatment administration, all subjects attended follow-up visits on Days 8, 29, 57, and 85 of Cycle 2. Subjects were assessed for the eligibility to receive the next treatment cycle from Day 85.
Any subjects who were not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study. A subject was considered to have completed the study when they had either received a total of five study treatment injections or completed a total of 15 months follow-up in the study following the first study treatment administration and completed the Day 85 visit following the last injection.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Subject's Self-Perception of Age at All Study Visits (OL Period)</title>
        <description>At cycle baseline (Day 1 of each treatment cycle) and Day 29 of each cycle in the OL period, subjects were asked to evaluate their age over the past 7 days at the time of assessment, using the following categories:
I look like my current age;
I look _ years younger;
I look _ years older.
The mean change from cycle baseline in subject's self-perception of age at Day 29 of each cycle of the OL Period was calculated. A negative mean change from baseline in the subject's self-perception of age indicates that the subject's self-perception was to look younger compared with baseline.</description>

      <time_frame>Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse event with start date on or after the first injection of study treatment or with start date prior to the first injection of study treatment but the intensity increased after the first injection of study treatment. TEAEs were collected until the end of Cycle 5 of the OL period, over a total timeframe of up to approximately 29 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>The safety population consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one injection of study treatment into at least one injection site. The safety population was analysed based on the treatment the subject actually received rather than the treatment to which the subject was randomised. The 1 subject who was randomised to Botox placebo group but received treatment of Dysport® 50 U in Cycle 1 was included in the Dysport® 50 U group and excluded from the Botox placebo group.</desc>

          <description>Subjects randomised to the Dysport® treatment group in Cycle 1 received on Day 1, 50 U (0.25 mL), divided into five injections into the glabellar area. 10 U (0.05 mL) of Dysport® was administered intramuscularly, at right angles to the skin into each of the five injection sites. The Investigator was blinded with respect to treatment injection.
Following treatment administration, all subjects attended follow-up visits on Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycle 1. On Day 85, subjects were assessed for their eligibility to enter the OL period (Cycles 2 to 5). Any subjects not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study. A subject was considered to have completed the study in Cycle 1 if they were not eligible for retreatment and had completed a total of 15 months follow-up following study treatment administration on Day 1.</description>

The Investigator was blinded with respect to treatment injection.
Following treatment administration, all subjects attended follow-up visits on Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycle 1. On Day 85, subjects were assessed for their eligibility to enter the OL period (Cycles 2 to 5). Any subjects not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study. A subject was considered to have completed the study in Cycle 1 if they were not eligible for retreatment and had completed a total of 15 months follow-up following study treatment administration on Day 1.</description>

          <description>After the first treatment cycle, all eligible subjects entered the OL period and received Dysport® 50 U (0.25 mL), injected into five predefined sites across the glabellar region. 10 U (0.05 mL) of Dysport® was administered intramuscularly, at right angles to the skin into each of the five injection sites per treatment cycle.
Subjects received a maximum of four treatment cycles (Cycles 2 to 5) with Dysport®. These cycles occurred at intervals of no less than 84 days (12 weeks) between each cycle, depending upon individual duration of response to Dysport® treatment. Any subjects not eligible for retreatment were evaluated every 28 days at additional follow-up visits until they were eligible for retreatment or had completed the study</description>
