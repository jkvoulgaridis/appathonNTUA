  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three methods for managing obesity in rural patients,
      to see which method will result in patients being able to attain their weight loss goal and
      maintain that weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 20% of the U.S. population lives in rural communities. Rural residents suffer at a
      higher rate from obesity and obesity-related illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease,
      and arthritis. Local primary care physicians are an important resource for treating obesity
      in rural areas because of a lack of other community resources.

      This study is looking at how effective current, real-world primary care treatment models are
      in helping rural residents lose weight and maintain that weight loss. Physician clinics will
      be randomized (like picking numbers from a hat) to conduct one of the three methods. The
      method a participant is part of will depend on the method their physician's clinic is
      randomized to. The three methods involved in this study are:

        1. Individual weight-management counseling in person

        2. Group weight-management counseling, both in person and by telephone

        3. Group weight-management counseling by telephone

      Participants will be in the study about 24 months. The number of in-person clinic visits and
      phone calls each participant will be asked to complete depends on the method.

    <description>The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-L) measure consists of a total score and five subscales--physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress, and work. The total score ranges from 31 to 155 with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. The SF-12 is a general quality of life measures with mental functioning and physical functioning component scores. It is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing better functioning.</description>
