      Randomized trial to determine if neo-adjuvant subcutaneous GM-CSF restores the host regional
      lymph node immunity
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma are immunosuppressed and the investigators
      have shown this occurs early in the disease process. This regional nodal immunosuppression
      precedes nodal metastasis and may be required for nodal spread. Administration of GM-CSF has
      been used to alter the immune response to metastatic melanoma. The investigators propose to
      assess whether administration of a short course of GM-CSF preoperatively to patients about to
      undergo wide local excisions and sentinel lymph node dissection can alter the immune
      environment of the sentinel lymph node and restore an immune surveillance profile in the
      sentinel lymph node.

    <description>The Th1/Th2/Th3 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) arrays will be used to quantify RNA expression of Th1 and Th2 messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs). Normalized gene expression was calculated from qRT-PCR results comparing GM-CSF and control subjects for both Th1-associated gene T-bet and Th2-associated gene GATA3 respectively. Fold change values are calculated by taking the normalized gene expression in GM-CSF treated group samples divided by the normalized gene expression in the control group samples.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

        To be eligible for the study, patients must satisfy the following criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed primary cutaneous malignant melanoma

          -  1-4mm Breslow depth

          -  Scheduled for sentinel lymph node biopsy as part of their standard surgical management

          -  Man or woman, age &gt;/= 18 years

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 2 weeks after the
             study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. WOCBP include any
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal.
             Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course
             of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. All WOCBP must have
             a negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving GM-CSF.

          -  Men must agree to use and utilize an adequate method of contraception throughout
             treatment and for at least 2 weeks after study drug is stopped

          -  All patients must be willing and able to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study
        entry

          -  Clinical stage III or IV disease

          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are excluded
             from this study as are patients with a history of immunologic disease (e.g. rheumatoid
             arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis, motor
             neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin)

          -  Any underlying medical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, will make
             the administration of GM-CSF hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse
             events; such as, psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and followup schedule

          -  Any vaccination therapy within 4 weeks prior to GM-CSF administration

          -  Concomitant therapy with any of the following within the past 3 months: GM-CSF,
             interferon, other non-study immunotherapy regimes; cytotoxic chemotherapy

          -  Immunosuppressive mediations (steroids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors,
             azathioprine, etc.) within the past 6 weeks

          -  Active or chronic infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C

          -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for
             the entire study period and 2 weeks after cessation of the study drug.

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained

        <title>Th1/Th2 Normalized Gene Expression</title>
        <description>The Th1/Th2/Th3 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) arrays will be used to quantify RNA expression of Th1 and Th2 messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs). Normalized gene expression was calculated from qRT-PCR results comparing GM-CSF and control subjects for both Th1-associated gene T-bet and Th2-associated gene GATA3 respectively. Fold change values are calculated by taking the normalized gene expression in GM-CSF treated group samples divided by the normalized gene expression in the control group samples.</description>

            <description>Patients will be treated with 14 days of GM-CSF self-administered subcutaneously daily for 14 days in a dose of 125 µg/m2 beginning on the day of enrollment. Patients will be instructed in the self-administration of GM-CSF and after they have demonstrated competency with the procedure, they will self-administer the treatment at home. Patients will undergo surgery within 1 day to 5 days after cessation of the GM-CSF therapy.

      <desc>Subjects receiving intervention will have adverse events (AEs) recorded during the 14 day course of self-administrated GM-CSF. Subjects will be provided a diary to record any AEs. Subjects will be provided a list of AEs and to call immediately for any grade 3 or high AEs. Grade I-II AEs will be logged into their diary. Diary will be collected the day of surgery. All-Cause Mortality, Serious, and Other (Not Including Serious) AEs were not monitored/assessed for the Standard of Care Arm/Group.</desc>
