  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Integra® TITAN™ Reverse Shoulder System (TRS) is a semi-constrained total shoulder
      construct. When used under the conditions and purposes intended the TRS will relieve pain and
      restore some functional joint motion to the affected shoulder. The purpose of this study is
      to assess the short, mid and long term outcomes of the TITAN™ Reverse Shoulder System.
