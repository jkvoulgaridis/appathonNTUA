        -  Inclusion Criteria:

               1. Pediatric patients with PWS confirmed by methylation PCR genetic testing

               2. Prepubertal pediatric patients (Tanner's Pubertal stage I) at screening

               3. Pediatric patients who have never been treated with hGH prior to screening, or
                  who had been treated with hGH for less than 6 months if they had a treatment
                  history, and whose last administration was made 6 months prior to screening

               4. Pediatric patients with normal thyroid function at screening (Those with normal
                  function through a hormonal therapy were allowable.)

               5. Pediatric patients whose parents or LARs signed the informed consent form in
                  writing after receiving the explanation about the purpose, method, effects, etc.
                  of the clinical study, and who also signed the informed consent form in writing
                  if they are capable of reading and understanding writing.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Pediatric patients who are accompanied by other causes for growth retardation as
                  follows except for PWS at screening

                  : Chronic renal failure (including the case in which renal transplantation has
                  been undergone), Silver-Russell syndrome, Turner's syndrome, Seckel syndrome,
                  Down's syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, congenital infections,
                  psychiatric disorders, chronic debilitating diseases, etc.

               2. Pediatric patients with malignancy or a history of malignancy at screening

               3. Pediatric patients with severe respiratory disturbance, or sleep apnoea or a
                  history of respiratory infections with an unknown cause at screening. However,
                  those whose condition had been confirmed to be eligible to participate in the
                  clinical study on investigator's judgment were allowed to participae in the
                  study.

               4. Pediatric patients with impaired fasting glucose, diabetes, and diabetic
                  retinopathy at screening

               5. Pediatric patients whose epiphyses are closed with a growth rate of ≤1 cm/year at
                  screening

               6. Pediatric patients who are being administered any drug that may have an effect on
                  the secretion and actions of hGH (estrogen, androgen, anabolic steroids,
                  corticosteroids, GnRH analogs, thyroxine, aromatase inhibitors, etc.) or
                  anticonvulsants and cyclosporin at screening, and have been administered any of
                  them for a long period of time within 6 months prior to screening (However, those
                  who have been administered a thyroxine preparation for ≥4 weeks on a stable dose
                  [allowable in case the investigator determines the dose is stable even though it
                  is changeable based upon the weight of the pediatric patient] were allowed to
                  participate in the clinical study.)

               7. Pediatric patients who are being administered any drug (e.g. methylphenidate) for
                  treatment of hyperactivity disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity
                  disorder (ADHD) at screening

               8. Pediatric patients who are hypersensitive to somatropin or any excipient of the
                  investigational product (cresol or glycerol) or who have a relevant history of
                  hypersensitivity

               9. Pediatric patients who have participated in any other clinical studies after
                  enrolled in this study or who had participated in any other clinical studies
                  within 3 months prior to enrollment in this clinical study

              10. Pediatric patients in whom this clinical study is considered to be difficult to
                  be conducted for any other reasons on investigator's judgment
