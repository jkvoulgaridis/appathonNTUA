      This research study aims to test the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Mayo Clinic
      Anxiety Coach smartphone app as an addition to traditional therapy for the treatment of
      anxiety disorders in youth, particularly those youth who may have limited access to mental
      health treatment in the traditional clinical setting. Therapist will provide CBT to patients
      with infrequent face-to-face contact and then will examine the acceptability, ease of use and
      need for contact.

    <description>The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is an interview-based tool used to assess for the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents utilizing parental and youth input to guide clinician ratings. The PARS has 5 questions. Four of those questions has a scale ranging from none (1) to extreme (5). The other question has a rating of 1-5. The total score ranges from 0 - 25, with 25 being the worst.</description>

    <description>Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach is a smartphone application based on cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety disorders (i.e., exposure-based therapy) that can be used as 1) a stand-alone treatment requiring minimal provider contact, and 2) an augmentation of face-to-face treatment that increases clinician fidelity and patient adherence to evidence-based treatment. The design of Anxiety Coach is based on evidence and theory suggesting that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are well-suited for encouraging behavior change through 1) scheduled reminders to engage in therapeutic exercises, 2) point of performance support, 3) individually tailored information, 4) real-time symptom assessment, and 5) readily accessible asynchronous communication.</description>

        <description>The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) is an interview-based tool used to assess for the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents utilizing parental and youth input to guide clinician ratings. The PARS has 5 questions. Four of those questions has a scale ranging from none (1) to extreme (5). The other question has a rating of 1-5. The total score ranges from 0 - 25, with 25 being the worst.</description>

Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach, a smartphone application based on cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety disorders can be used as a stand-alone treatment using minimal provider contact &amp; an augmentation of face-to-face treatment that increases clinician fidelity &amp; patient adherence to evidence-based treatment. Anxiety Coach's design is based on evidence &amp; theory suggesting that information &amp; communication technologies (ICTs) are well-suited for encouraging behavior change through scheduled reminders to engage in therapeutic exercises; point of performance support; individually tailored information; real-time symptom assessment &amp; readily accessible asynchronous communication.</description>
