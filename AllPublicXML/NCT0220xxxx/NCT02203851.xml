  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Study M16-009 was to investigate the safety of risankizumab in
      participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were receiving long-term
      treatment. Additional study objectives were to further investigate the long-term efficacy,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of risankizumab.

      Participants who had successfully completed Study 1311.2 (NCT02054481; the lead-in study) and
      met the eligibility criteria for Study M16-009 (extension study) had the option to enter the
      extension study. Participants were allowed to have the End of Study Visit in the lead in
      study combined with the Week 0 Visit for the extension study. At the Week 12 visit,
      participants were assigned to treatment based on 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and
      Severity Index (PASI90) Score: participants with ≥PASI90 Score at Week 12 continued to
      receive risankizumab 90 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection; participants with &lt;PASI90 Score at
      Week 12 switched to risankizumab 180 mg by SC injection.

      Efficacy results are summarized by the 4 treatment groups from the lead-in study, which
      included the following: Participants who received risankizumab 18 mg in the lead-in study and
      risankizumab in the extension study (Risankizumab 18 mg/Risankizumab); participants who
      received risankizumab 90 mg in the lead-in study and risankizumab in the extension study
      (Risankizumab 90 mg/Risankizumab); participants who received risankizumab 180 mg in the
      lead-in study and risankizumab in the extension study (Risankizumab 180 mg/Risankizumab); and
      participants who received ustekinumab (Stelara) 45 or 90 mg in the lead-in study and
      risankizumab in the extension study (Ustekinumab/Risankizumab).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event with an onset after the first dose of risankizumab in this study. See the Adverse Event section for details.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. Baseline PASI for this study is defined as the baseline PASI in the lead-in study. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100.</description>

    <description>The sPGA is an assessment by the investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The sPGA ranges from 0 to 4, and is calculated as Clear (0) = 0 for all three; Almost clear (1) = mean &gt;0, &lt;1.5; Mild (2) = mean ≥1.5, &lt;2.5; Moderate (3) = mean ≥2.5, &lt;3.5; and Severe (4) = mean ≥3.5.

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event with an onset after the first dose of risankizumab in this study. See the Adverse Event section for details.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 90% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) Score at Week 48 in the Extended Dosing Period</title>
        <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI90 is defined as at least a 90% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. Baseline PASI for this study is defined as the baseline PASI in the lead-in study. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75% Improvement in PASI (PASI75) Score at Week 48 in the Extended Dosing Period</title>
          <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The severity of each sign was assessed using a 5-point scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, where 0 indicates no psoriasis and 72 indicates very severe psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI score compared with the Baseline PASI score. Baseline PASI for this study is defined as the baseline PASI in the lead-in study. The percent reduction in score is calculated as (PASI score at Baseline - score at follow-up visit) / PASI score at Baseline * 100.</description>
