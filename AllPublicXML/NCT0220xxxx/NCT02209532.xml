      This is a randomized, prospective, open label, multicenter study to assess the safety and
      utility of PINPOINT® Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging (PINPOINT) in identification of lymph
      nodes (LN) in patients with uterine and cervical malignancies who are undergoing LN mapping.

    <description>The cervix will be injected 4 times with a 1ml solution of 1% Isosulfan blue followed by injection 4 times of 1 ml of 1.25 mg/ml solution of ICG. LN mapping with Blue dye will be performed until the investigator identifies all blue nodes or determines that blue nodes cannot be identified. Once complete, the Investigator will begin mapping with PINPOINT until all 'ICG' nodes are identified or the investigator determines that 'ICG' nodes cannot be identified. Once mapping with both Blue dye and PINPOINT have been completed and documented, LNs identified with Blue dye or PINPOINT will be excised.</description>

LN mapping with PINPOINT will be performed until the investigator identifies all ‘ICG’ nodes or determines that ‘ICG’ nodes cannot be identified. Once complete, the Investigator will begin mapping with Blue dye until all ‘blue’ nodes are identified or the investigator determines that ‘blue’ nodes cannot be identified. Once mapping with both Blue dye and PINPOINT have been completed and documented, LNs identified with Blue dye or PINPOINT will be excised.

        <population>180 subjects were randomized. 4 subjects were found to be ineligible after randomization (subjects did not receive study treatment). Of the 176 subjects randomized who completed the study, 13 had significant protocol deviations. Thus, 163 subjects are included in the analysis population (81 subjects in the B-P arm and 82 subjects in the P-B arm).</population>

            <description>The cervix will be injected 4 times with 1 ml of a 1.25 mg/ml solution of ICG followed by injection 4 times of a 1 ml solution of 1% Isosulfan blue. LN mapping with PINPOINT will be performed until the investigator identifies all ‘ICG’ nodes or determines that ‘ICG’ nodes cannot be identified. Once complete, the Investigator will begin mapping with Blue dye until all ‘blue’ nodes are identified or the investigator determines that ‘blue’ nodes cannot be identified. Once mapping with both Blue dye and PINPOINT have been completed and documented, LNs identified with Blue dye or PINPOINT will be excised.
