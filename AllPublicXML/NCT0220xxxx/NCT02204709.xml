  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how eating fish raised to have different levels of
      omega-3 fatty acids will reduce cardiovascular risk markers in people with elevated
      cardiovascular risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of fish high in long chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCn3) is associated with
      reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. CVD is a major cause of death in the United
      States. The current obesity epidemic contributes significantly to elevated CVD risk by
      increasing inflammation and platelet dysfunction. Prevention of CVD is a public health goal
      and comprises several avenues of action, of which inclusion of LCn3-rich fish in the diet may
      be one of the most effective.

      Obese participants will participate in a double blind, randomized, cross-over designed trial
      in which they will consume twice-weekly a prepared meal containing diploid (2N) farmed
      rainbow trout, triploid (3N) farmed rainbow trout containing higher levels of LCn3, or
      tilapia, a low LCn3 fish.
