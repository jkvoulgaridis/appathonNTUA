  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      momelotinib (MMB) and erlotinib, as well as define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      momelotinib (MMB) combined with erlotinib in adults with epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)-mutated, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Participants will be sequentially enrolled to receive progressively
      increasing doses of momelotinib (MMB) in combination with erlotinib. Escalation of
      momelotinib (MMB) doses will proceed to the MTD, defined as the highest tested dose
      associated with dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first 28 days of combined erlotinib
      and momelotinib (MMB) treatment. There will be four dose levels and each treatment cycle will
      consist of 28 days.
