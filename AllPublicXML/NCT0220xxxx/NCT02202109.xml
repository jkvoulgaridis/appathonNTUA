    <textblock>
      The study will test the significance of community health worker (CHW) participation by
      comparing self-sampling provided by a community health worker and self-sampling provided by
      mail. The study will enroll 700 participants in communities that lack access to medical care
      in South Florida.

    <time_frame>2 to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is having had a self-sampling done since the initial evaluation. Participants who test negative will be encouraged to rescreen while Participants who test positive for HPV will be navigated to appropriate follow-up care. The CHWs will follow up with participants who do not return the kit within 60 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Change in Cervical Cancer Knowledge Among Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical cancer knowledge was measured with a series of questions asked at both pre(baseline) and post (exit). The questions were designed to measure participant's knowledge of cervical cancer prior to the study intervention and following the intervention. Cervical cancer knowledge is defined by participants answering 3 out 5 questions correctly.</description>
