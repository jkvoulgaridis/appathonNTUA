    <measure>Distribution of Stereoacuity Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (measure as seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods.
Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 seconds of arc (if correct response). Nil was assigned a score of 4000 seconds of arc and was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.</description>

    <measure>Binocular Treatment Group: Adherence and Fellow-eye Contrast (iPad Log File Data)</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study period, up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assigned to binocular treatment were prescribed the binocular falling blocks game for 1 hour per day (allowing division into shorter sessions), 7 days per week for 16 weeks, with instructions to perform therapy a minimum of 4 days per week if unable to play for 7 days per week.
The iPad device automatically recorded duration of game play, fellow-eye contrast, and performance. Adherence was calculated as the total hours of game play since baseline divided by the total prescribed hours (based on intended dose of 1 hour a day, 7 days per week) since baseline.
The fellow-eye contrast was initially set to 20% (amblyopic eye always at 100%) and automatically increased or decreased by 10% increments (lowest level of 10%) or left unchanged from the last contrast level, based on the previous day's game play duration (at least 30 minutes required for contrast change) and performance (increased if scored 1000 points or more).

    <description>Participants who were randomly assigned to binocular treatment were prescribed 1 hour of game play per day, 7 days a week while those assigned to the patching group were prescribed 2 hours of daily patching, 7 days per week.
Parents were asked to record the amount of time that the participant played the binocular game (binocular treatment group) or wore the patch (patching group) each day on a calendar.
At each study visit, the investigator estimated the frequency and duration of treatment that the participant completed based on the parent-reported calendars and discussion with the participant and/or parent(s). For analysis, the percentage of prescribed treatment completed was calculated as the total number of reported hours of treatment completed since baseline divided by the total number of prescribed hours (refer to the intended treatment dose/frequency listed above) since baseline.</description>

               3. Criteria for combined-mechanism amblyopia: Both of the following criteria must be
                  met:

                    -  Criteria for strabismus are met (see above)

                    -  ≥1.00 D difference between eyes in spherical equivalent OR ≥1.50 D
                       difference between eyes in astigmatism in any meridian

                    -  Note: the spherical equivalent requirement differs from that in the
                       definition for refractive/anisometropic amblyopia

          3. No amblyopia treatment in the past 2 weeks (patching, atropine, Bangerter, vision
             therapy)

          4. Refractive correction (spectacles or contact lenses, if applicable) must meet the
             following criteria at enrollment and be based on a cycloplegic refraction that is not
             more than 7 months old.

               1. Requirements for Correction of Refractive Error:

                    1. For subjects meeting criteria for strabismic (only) amblyopia (see 2.2.1 #2
                       above):

                       • Hypermetropia, if corrected, must not be under-corrected by more than
                       +1.50 D spherical equivalent, and the reduction in plus sphere must be
                       symmetric in the two eyes.

                    2. For subjects meeting criteria for anisometropic or combined-mechanism
                       amblyopia (see 2.2.1 #2 above):

                         -  Spherical equivalent must be within 0.50 D of fully correcting the
                            anisometropia

                         -  Hypermetropia must not be under-corrected by more than +1.50 D
                            spherical equivalent, and reduction in plus must be symmetric in the
                            two eyes

                         -  Cylinder power in both eyes must be within 0.50 D of fully correcting
                            the astigmatism

                         -  Cylinder axis for both eyes must be within 6 degrees of the axis of the
                            cycloplegic refraction when cylinder power is ≥1.00 D

               2. Refractive corrections meeting the above criteria must be worn for either:

                    -  16 weeks or more or

                    -  Until visual acuity in amblyopic eye is stable (defined as 2 consecutive
                       visual acuity measurements by the same testing method at least 4 weeks apart
                       with &lt;1 line change (&lt;5 letters if E-ETDRS))

               3. Monocular or binocular contact lens wear is allowed provided the contact lenses
                  meet the above refractive requirements at the corneal plane. The same form of
                  correction must be worn throughout the entire study during study procedures
                  (i.e., no changing between contacts and spectacles while patching or while
                  game-playing or study testing). Safety glasses are not required for subjects
                  wearing contact lenses, but investigators are encouraged to suggest safety
                  glasses be worn over contact lenses.

          5. Visual acuity, measured in each eye without cycloplegia in current refractive
             correction (if applicable) within 7 days prior to randomization using the Amblyopia
             Treatment Study single-surround HOTV (ATS-HOTV) visual acuity protocol for children &lt;
             7 years and the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) visual
             acuity protocol for children ≥ 7 years on a study-approved device displaying single
             surrounded optotypes, as follows:

               1. Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye 20/40 to 20/200 inclusive (33 to 72 letters if
                  E-ETDRS)

               2. Visual acuity in the fellow eye 20/25 or better (≥ 78 letters if E-ETDRS)

               3. Interocular difference ≥ 3 logMAR lines (≥ 15 letters if E-ETDRS) (i.e.,
                  amblyopic-eye acuity at least 3 logMAR lines worse than fellow-eye acuity)

          6. Heterotropia or heterophoria with a total near deviation of ≤ 10∆ (measured by PACT).

          7. Ability to align the nonius cross on the binocular game system (angles of ocular
             deviation &gt;10∆ would require the nonius cross to be adjusted to such an extent that
             playing of the game would be compromised).

          8. Subject is able to play Hess Falling Blocks game on the study iPad® (on easy setting)
             under binocular conditions (with red-green glasses), as demonstrated by scoring at
             least 1 line in the office.

          9. Investigator is willing to prescribe computer game play or patching per protocol.

         10. Parent understands the protocol and is willing to accept randomization.

         11. Parent has phone (or access to phone) and is willing to be contacted by Jaeb Center
             staff.

         12. Relocation outside of area of an active Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group
             (PEDIG) site for this study within the next 16 weeks is not anticipated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject is excluded for any of the following reasons:

          1. Prism in the refractive correction at time of enrollment (eligible only if prism is
             discontinued 2 weeks prior to enrollment).

          2. Myopia greater than -6.00 D spherical equivalent in either eye.

          3. Previous intraocular or refractive surgery.

          4. Any treatment for amblyopia (patching, atropine, Bangerter filter, or vision therapy)
             during the past 2 weeks. Previous amblyopia therapy is allowed regardless of type, but
             must be discontinued at least 2 weeks immediately prior to enrollment.

          5. Ocular co-morbidity that may reduce visual acuity determined by an ocular examination
             performed within the past 7 months (Note: nystagmus per se does not exclude the
             subject if the above visual acuity criteria are met).

          6. No Down syndrome or cerebral palsy

          7. No severe developmental delay that would interfere with treatment or evaluation (in
             the opinion of the investigator). Subjects with mild speech delay or reading and/or
             learning disabilities are not excluded.

          8. Heterotropia or heterophoria with a total ocular deviation &gt;10∆ (phoria plus tropia
             &gt;10∆) at near (measured by PACT).

          <title>Baseline Stereoacuity (Seconds of Arc)</title>
          <description>Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000 ) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.</description>

          <title>Baseline Stereoacuity (Seconds of Arc)</title>
          <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (measured as seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) stereoacuity test methods as previously described. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores (Nil was assigned a score of 4000) to the log scale to calculate descriptive statistics (reported as seconds of arc).</description>
          <population>Descriptive statistics were computed for baseline stereoacuity by treatment group for all participants and a subset of participants with no history of strabismus.
The younger (age 5 to &lt;7 years) and older (age 7 to &lt;13 years) were analyzed as separate study cohorts.
Results of the descriptive analyses are reported as seconds of arc.</population>

For the younger cohort, the level of visual acuity is analyzed in the log of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) scale (approximate range: -0.2 to 1.7) such that higher scores indicate poorer VA.

            <groups_desc>A linear mixed model was used to compare the rate of amblyopic-eye visual acuity improvement between the treatment groups. The ANCOVA model included an interaction term with treatment group and time to compare the change in visual acuity over follow-up by treatment group, adjusting for the main effects of the interaction term and baseline covariates of age and visual acuity. If the interaction term was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05), no further comparisons would be performed.</groups_desc>

        <description>Monocular distance visual acuity (VA) in current refractive correction (if required) in each eye by a certified examiner using the electronic Amblyopia Treatment Study single-surround HOTV (ATS-HOTV) visual acuity protocol for children &lt;7 years and the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinoscopy Study (E-ETDRS) visual acuity protocol for children ≥ 7 years on a study-certified acuity tester displaying single surrounded optotypes.
For the younger cohort, the level of VA is analyzed in the log of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) scale (previously defined) and change in VA from baseline as logMAR lines (previously defined, positive values indicate improvement), For both descriptive and formal subgroup analyses, all subgroup factors were pre-specified except for baseline stereoacuity (nil, better than nil). We performed post hoc descriptive analyses to explore treatment effect by baseline age (5 to &lt;7 yrs, 7 to &lt;13 yrs) and prior amblyopia treatment (yes/no).</description>

        <title>Distribution of Stereoacuity Scores</title>
        <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (measure as seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods.
Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity. Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 seconds of arc (if correct response). Nil was assigned a score of 4000 seconds of arc and was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.</description>

A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) to the log scale (conversion reference listed below), which was used to calculate descriptive statistics. Results of the descriptive analyses are reported as seconds of arc.</description>

        <title>Distribution of Change in Stereoacuity Scores From Baseline</title>
        <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000 ) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.
For each visit, stereoacuity scores were ordered and assigned a rank score. Change in stereoacuity was calculated as the difference in ranked score between the enrollment and 16-week stereoacuity scores.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis included all participants who completed stereoacuity testing at both baseline and the 16-week visit (regardless of whether or not the exam was completed within the pre-specified analysis window).</population>

Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000 ) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.
For each visit, stereoacuity scores were ordered and assigned a rank score. Change in stereoacuity was calculated as the difference in ranked score between the enrollment and 16-week stereoacuity scores.</description>
          <population>The analysis included all participants who completed stereoacuity testing at both baseline and the 16-week visit (regardless of whether or not the exam was completed within the pre-specified analysis window).</population>

        <description>Stereoacuity was tested at near in current refractive correction. Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Butterfly (scores: 2000, Nil) and Randot Preschool stereoacuity (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40) test methods. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
Results of the Randot Butterfly test were analyzed as 2000 (if correct response). Nil (4000 ) was defined as (1) an incorrect response on the butterfly in absence of a correct response on the 800 seconds of arc level of the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test or (2) an incorrect response on the 800 seconds of arc level if the butterfly was not attempted.
For each visit, stereoacuity scores were ordered and assigned a rank score. Change in stereoacuity was calculated as the difference in ranked score between the enrollment and 16-week stereoacuity scores.</description>

        <title>Binocular Treatment Group: Adherence and Fellow-eye Contrast (iPad Log File Data)</title>
        <description>Participants assigned to binocular treatment were prescribed the binocular falling blocks game for 1 hour per day (allowing division into shorter sessions), 7 days per week for 16 weeks, with instructions to perform therapy a minimum of 4 days per week if unable to play for 7 days per week.
The iPad device automatically recorded duration of game play, fellow-eye contrast, and performance. Adherence was calculated as the total hours of game play since baseline divided by the total prescribed hours (based on intended dose of 1 hour a day, 7 days per week) since baseline.
The fellow-eye contrast was initially set to 20% (amblyopic eye always at 100%) and automatically increased or decreased by 10% increments (lowest level of 10%) or left unchanged from the last contrast level, based on the previous day's game play duration (at least 30 minutes required for contrast change) and performance (increased if scored 1000 points or more).

        <title>Binocular Treatment Group: Median Adherence With Prescribed Game Play (iPad Log File Data)</title>
        <description>Participants assigned to binocular treatment were prescribed the binocular falling blocks game for 1 hour per day (allowing division into shorter sessions), 7 days per week for 16 weeks, with instructions to perform therapy a minimum of 4 days per week if unable to play for 7 days per week.
The iPad device automatically recorded duration of game play, fellow-eye contrast, and performance.
Adherence was calculated as the % of prescribed treatment actually completed: total hours of game play since baseline divided by the total prescribed hours (based on intended dose of 1 hour a day, 7 days per week) since baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Entire study period, up to 16 weeks</time_frame>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Reporting &gt;75% of Prescribed Treatment Completed (Subjective Measures of Adherence)</title>
        <description>Participants who were randomly assigned to binocular treatment were prescribed 1 hour of game play per day, 7 days a week while those assigned to the patching group were prescribed 2 hours of daily patching, 7 days per week.
Parents were asked to record the amount of time that the participant played the binocular game (binocular treatment group) or wore the patch (patching group) each day on a calendar.
At each study visit, the investigator estimated the frequency and duration of treatment that the participant completed based on the parent-reported calendars and discussion with the participant and/or parent(s). For analysis, the percentage of prescribed treatment completed was calculated as the total number of reported hours of treatment completed since baseline divided by the total number of prescribed hours (refer to the intended treatment dose/frequency listed above) since baseline.</description>

For the younger cohort, the level of visual acuity is analyzed in the log of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) scale (approximate range: -0.2 to 1.7) such that higher scores indicate poorer VA. Change in VA is computed as logMAR lines (positive values indicate improvement), defined as the difference between the enrollment and 16-week acuities (logMAR) multiplied by 10.
For this safety analysis, the change in fellow-eye visual acuity (logMAR lines) was computed by treatment group, adjusting for baseline visual acuity.</description>
