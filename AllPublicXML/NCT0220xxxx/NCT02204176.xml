  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of adult obesity in the United States has increased more than two times since 1970,
      and the rate of child-teen obesity has increased by four times. One of the antecedents of
      obesity is an inactive lifestyle. Exercise has been known to be associated with increases in
      both physical and mental health by increasing longevity, preventing risk of obesity, coronary
      heart disease, and hypertension, and increasing self-esteem and overall quality of life. The
      broad aim of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of psychoeducational
      training to increase exercise activity initiation and maintenance in young adults.

      The goal of this study is to compare three training approaches for college students to
      increase exercise behavior. One approach provides general information on the different types
      of exercises and benefits of engaging in exercise behavior after an initial questionnaire
      assessment session. A second approach includes the general exercise information and
      questionnaire assessment as well as training on how to create specific goal intentions (i.e.,
      implementation intentions) to aid in exercise initiation. A third approach uses all the
      components of the second approach but also tests the utility of a personality-informed module
      by incorporating concepts from the theory of learned industriousness. It is expected that the
      third approach will be the most effective in helping participants initiate and maintain their
      exercise activities during the course of the study duration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study (mentioned in the Brief Summary) will be addressed using a 6-month
      multi-wave assessment of approximately 200 college students. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the three approaches once it is determined they meet study criteria.
      Random assignment will occur when the participants are scheduled for the first session.

      All participants will partake in three group sessions. The first session will take
      approximately 2 hours to complete. The second and third sessions will be scheduled 2 and 6
      months after the first session and will take approximately 45 minutes each to complete.

      In the initial session for the first approach, the group session will include discussion of
      what constitutes regular physical activity and benefits of exercise and basic tips on the
      activity itself. Guidelines for prescribing suggested exercises will be based on
      recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as risks
      associated with exercise and how they can be reduced.

      In the initial session for the second approach, the group session will include discussion of
      all the components from the first approach, but with more emphasis on how to create
      implementation intentions. Discussions will revolve around possible barriers to exercise
      plans and how to overcome those barriers by making specific plans of when and where to
      exercise, along with designating which types of exercises they will perform and for how long
      (or how many repetitions).

      In the initial session for the third approach, the group session will include discussion of
      all the components from the second approach as well as include findings on industriousness.
      Participants will be directed to think about and generate solutions to how they can become
      more industrious despite the difficulties they may face and relate these solutions to help
      them engage in more exercise behavior.

      For all approaches, participants will complete questionnaires regarding aspects of their
      personality, attitudes regarding exercise, beliefs about the positive and negative effects of
      exercise, confidence in engaging in exercise despite barriers, and current levels of
      exercise. Participants' body mass index will also be measured. All participants will be given
      an exercise booklet tailored to their respective approaches to record their exercise behavior
      during the three weeks following the initial session. They will also be loaned a pedometer
      that will be used to track their overall daily activities for the same three-week period.
      Participants in the third approach will also receive booster contacts (to encourage them to
      think about their efforts and monitoring of physical activity) every two weeks starting after
      the three-week tracking period until their six-month follow up (total of 11 booster
      contacts).

      The first session will be video and audio recorded to check on and ensure presentation
      consistency. At the end of the first session, participants will be given a post-session
      survey to gauge how well materials were presented and to determine how much information
      participants felt they gained from the session. When participants return their daily exercise
      diaries and pedometers, they will also complete a condensed set of measures (similar to those
      in the first session) to track any changes experienced during the three-week tracking period.

      For the 2- and 6-month follow-up sessions, participants in all approaches will complete the
      same questionnaires as in the initial session and have their body mass index measured.

      Power analyses conducted via G*Power, 3.1.6 indicated that 159 participants will be needed to
      detect an effect size of F of 0.25 with alpha error probability at 0.05 and power at 1-Β
      =.80. Oversampling by 25% will occur to account for possible attrition from the study,
      thereby making the target N = 200.

    <description>The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ; Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985) was used to assess the frequency of typical weekly strenuous, moderate, and mild exercise (open-ended format). Total exercise scores were also computed by multiplying each reported exercise frequency by its metabolic equivalent (MET) and then summing the totals: (strenuous x 9) + (moderate x 5) + (mild x 2) (Godin, Jobin, &amp; Boullon, 1986). Higher scores on this scale indicates more exercise engagement.
Also, participants were loaned a pedometer to obtain objective measures of exercise activity. The pedometers allow participants to enter their weight and height and measure steps taken throughout the day based on this information. The devices automatically reset at midnight and store the information for 30 days.</description>

    <description>The 18-item multidimensional exercise self-efficacy scale (Benisovich, Rossi, Norman, &amp; Nigg, 1998) assessed participants' confidence in being able to exercise despite bad weather, inconvenience, negative affect, exercising alone, excuse making, and resistance from others. Participants were asked to rate &quot;how confident [they] are to exercise when other things get in the way&quot; on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all confident, 5 = Extremely confident). Example items include, &quot;I don't have access to exercise equipment,&quot; &quot;I don't feel like it,&quot; and &quot;I am spending time with friends or family who do not exercise.&quot; All items on the scale were averaged for each participant. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy for exercise.</description>

          <description>This group discussed all components from the action planning condition. Discussion in this group also emphasized the importance of persistence and effortful control in daily life and how these attributes can be transferred to exercise plans. Participants were encouraged to identify their threshold for exerting effort toward exercise based on past experiences and applying that awareness to their planned exercises. They were guided in creating action plans that considered not only past external barriers (e.g., schedule, fitness level, and environment) but also previous internal barriers (i.e., resistance and/or aversiveness to physical exertion) and create plans that would help them avoid repeating the same circumstances. Participants were also asked to realistically consider how much past exercise they have previously engaged in and to refine those estimates to serve as starting points for subsequent small increases in planned exercise. These group sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>

          <title>Exercise Information</title>
          <description>This group was presented with information that defined and described regular exercise, its benefits, and guidance for using proper form in exercise to minimize the risk of injury. Guidelines for prescribing suggested physical activities were based on recommendations from the USDHHS (2008). These sessions lasted ~90 minutes.</description>

          <title>Action Planning</title>
          <description>This group discussed all the components from the session for the information-only group with an additional emphasis on how to create action plans. Discussions revolved around possible ways and times of the day to engage in exercise by making specific action plans that designate when, where, and how. Participants were shown how to create an example action plan and guided in writing their own exercise action plans for as many days as they desired in the three-week tracking period in their exercise booklets. Emphasis was placed on the specificity and feasibility of the plans. These sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>

          <title>Realistic Effort Action Planning</title>
          <description>This group discussed all components from the action planning condition. Discussion in this group also emphasized the importance of persistence and effortful control in daily life and how these attributes can be transferred to exercise plans. Participants were encouraged to identify their threshold for exerting effort toward exercise based on past experiences and applying that awareness to their planned exercises. They were guided in creating action plans that considered not only past external barriers (e.g., schedule, fitness level, and environment) but also previous internal barriers (i.e., resistance and/or aversiveness to physical exertion) and create plans that would help them avoid repeating the same circumstances. Participants were also asked to realistically consider how much past exercise they have previously engaged in and to refine those estimates to serve as starting points for subsequent small increases in planned exercise. These group sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>

Total exercise scores were also computed by multiplying each reported exercise frequency by its metabolic equivalent (MET) and then summing the totals: (strenuous x 9) + (moderate x 5) + (mild x 2) (Godin, Jobin, &amp; Boullon, 1986). Higher scores on this scale indicates more exercise engagement.
Also, participants were loaned a pedometer to obtain objective measures of exercise activity. The pedometers allow participants to enter their weight and height and measure steps taken throughout the day based on this information. The devices automatically reset at midnight and store the information for 30 days.</description>

            <description>This group discussed all the components from the session for the information-only group with an additional emphasis on how to create action plans. Discussions revolved around possible ways and times of the day to engage in exercise by making specific action plans that designate when, where, and how. Participants were shown how to create an example action plan and guided in writing their own exercise action plans for as many days as they desired in the three-week tracking period in their exercise booklets. Emphasis was placed on the specificity and feasibility of the plans. These sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>

            <title>Realistic Effort Action Planning</title>
            <description>This group discussed all components from the action planning condition. Discussion in this group also emphasized the importance of persistence and effortful control in daily life and how these attributes can be transferred to exercise plans. Participants were encouraged to identify their threshold for exerting effort toward exercise based on past experiences and applying that awareness to their planned exercises. They were guided in creating action plans that considered not only past external barriers (e.g., schedule, fitness level, and environment) but also previous internal barriers (i.e., resistance and/or aversiveness to physical exertion) and create plans that would help them avoid repeating the same circumstances. Participants were also asked to realistically consider how much past exercise they have previously engaged in and to refine those estimates to serve as starting points for subsequent small increases in planned exercise. These group sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>

          <title>Total Physical Activity</title>
          <description>The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ; Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985) was used to assess the frequency of typical weekly strenuous, moderate, and mild exercise (open-ended format). Total exercise scores were also computed by multiplying each reported exercise frequency by its metabolic equivalent (MET) and then summing the totals: (strenuous x 9) + (moderate x 5) + (mild x 2) (Godin, Jobin, &amp; Boullon, 1986). Higher scores on this scale indicates more exercise engagement.
Also, participants were loaned a pedometer to obtain objective measures of exercise activity. The pedometers allow participants to enter their weight and height and measure steps taken throughout the day based on this information. The devices automatically reset at midnight and store the information for 30 days.</description>

        <title>Exercise Self-efficacy</title>
        <description>The 18-item multidimensional exercise self-efficacy scale (Benisovich, Rossi, Norman, &amp; Nigg, 1998) assessed participants' confidence in being able to exercise despite bad weather, inconvenience, negative affect, exercising alone, excuse making, and resistance from others. Participants were asked to rate &quot;how confident [they] are to exercise when other things get in the way&quot; on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all confident, 5 = Extremely confident). Example items include, &quot;I don't have access to exercise equipment,&quot; &quot;I don't feel like it,&quot; and &quot;I am spending time with friends or family who do not exercise.&quot; All items on the scale were averaged for each participant. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy for exercise.</description>

        <title>Industriousness Level</title>
        <description>Industriousness was assessed using a 10-item Industriousness scale (Chernyshenko, 2003). Participants rated themselves on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Disagree strongly, 5 = Agree strongly) indicating the extent to which, for example, they are someone who &quot;has high standards and works toward them; setting goals and achieving them is not very important to me [reversed], [or] invests little effort into my work [reversed] &quot;. Higher scores indicate greater industriousness level.</description>

            <description>This group was presented with information that defined and described regular exercise, its benefits, and guidance for using proper form in exercise to minimize the risk of injury. Guidelines for prescribing suggested physical activities were based on recommendations from the USDHHS (2008). These sessions lasted ~90 minutes.</description>

            <description>This group discussed all the components from the session for the information-only group with an additional emphasis on how to create action plans. Discussions revolved around possible ways and times of the day to engage in exercise by making specific action plans that designate when, where, and how. Participants were shown how to create an example action plan and guided in writing their own exercise action plans for as many days as they desired in the three-week tracking period in their exercise booklets. Emphasis was placed on the specificity and feasibility of the plans. These sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>

            <title>Realistic Effort Action Planning</title>
            <description>This group discussed all components from the action planning condition. Discussion in this group also emphasized the importance of persistence and effortful control in daily life and how these attributes can be transferred to exercise plans. Participants were encouraged to identify their threshold for exerting effort toward exercise based on past experiences and applying that awareness to their planned exercises. They were guided in creating action plans that considered not only past external barriers (e.g., schedule, fitness level, and environment) but also previous internal barriers (i.e., resistance and/or aversiveness to physical exertion) and create plans that would help them avoid repeating the same circumstances. Participants were also asked to realistically consider how much past exercise they have previously engaged in and to refine those estimates to serve as starting points for subsequent small increases in planned exercise. These group sessions lasted ~120 minutes.</description>
