      Defining Which Remission Criterion at Month 6 Predicts Remission at Month 12 in a Real Life
      Clinical Practice, in a Cohort of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with Etanercept

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on a logistic regression defining the
      dependent variable as the remission at Month 12 and the 5 independent variables as CDAI,
      SDAI, DAS28, DAS28 and Ultrasound, and EULAR Boolean definition for clinical practice and
      clinical studies.

      This analysis will be conducted in each arm of the study as well as after a pooling of both
      patient groups.

      In this context it seems reasonable to ensure the completion of the study by a total
      approximate number of 100 patients (approximately 50 patients per arm). In order to ensure 50
      completers in each arm, 70 patients will be recruited at baseline, taking into account a drop
      out rate of 30% over 1 year period.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count (DAS28) Less Than (&lt;) 2.6 at Month 6 and Maintained Till Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28 was calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joints count, C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hr]) levels and patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity on a 0-100 mm scale (scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicated worst health condition). DAS28 score range from 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity). DAS28 [less than or equal to] &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 less than (&lt;) 2.6 implied remission.</description>

    <description>A participant was in remission based on US7: if US7 synovitis sum score in grey-scale Ultrasonography (GSUS) =0, Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) =0 and erosion sum score in GSUS=0. US7 score is musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MKUS) composite scoring system which combined soft tissue lesions (synovitis) and destructive processes (erosions) in a single scoring system. US7 score included MKUS examination of the following joints of the more clinically affected side: wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) II and III, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) II and III, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) II and V. The joints were examined by GSUS and PDUS for synovitis. Synovitis in GSUS and PDUS was analyzed on a scale of 0-3 (GSUS: 0=no synovitis, 3=severe synovitis; higher score=more synovitis); (PDUS: 0=no intraarticular color signal, 3 = &gt;=50% of the intraarticular area filled with color signals). Erosions in GSUS and PDUS were calculated on a binary basis 0 and 1 where 0=no remission and remission=1.</description>

        <description>DAS28 was a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28 was calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joints count, C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hr]) levels and patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity on a 0-100 mm scale (scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicated worst health condition). DAS28 score range from 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity). DAS28 [less than or equal to] &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 less than (&lt;) 2.6 implied remission.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Remission Based on Seven-Joint Ultrasound (US7) Measurements at Month 6 and Maintained Till Month 12</title>
        <description>A participant was in remission based on US7: if US7 synovitis sum score in grey-scale Ultrasonography (GSUS) =0, Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) =0 and erosion sum score in GSUS=0. US7 score is musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MKUS) composite scoring system which combined soft tissue lesions (synovitis) and destructive processes (erosions) in a single scoring system. US7 score included MKUS examination of the following joints of the more clinically affected side: wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) II and III, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) II and III, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) II and V. The joints were examined by GSUS and PDUS for synovitis. Synovitis in GSUS and PDUS was analyzed on a scale of 0-3 (GSUS: 0=no synovitis, 3=severe synovitis; higher score=more synovitis); (PDUS: 0=no intraarticular color signal, 3 = &gt;=50% of the intraarticular area filled with color signals). Erosions in GSUS and PDUS were calculated on a binary basis 0 and 1 where 0=no remission and remission=1.</description>

SDAI total score ranged from 0 (no disease activity) to 86 (maximal disease activity), where higher scores represents higher disease activity. SDAI &gt;3.4 to 11 implied low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26 implied moderate disease activity, &gt;26 implied high disease activity and &lt;=3.3 implied disease remission.</description>

        <description>A participant was in remission based on US7: if US7 synovitis sum score in GSUS =0, PDUS =0 and erosion sum score in GSUS=0. US7 score is MKUS composite scoring system which combined soft tissue lesions (synovitis) and destructive processes (erosions) in a single scoring system. US7 score included MKUS examination of the following joints of the more clinically affected side: wrist, MCP II and III, PIP II and III, MTP II and V. The joints were examined by GSUS and PDUS for synovitis. Synovitis in GSUS and PDUS was analyzed on a scale of 0-3 (GSUS: 0=no synovitis, 3=severe synovitis; higher score=more synovitis); (PDUS: 0=no intraarticular color signal, 3 = &gt;=50% of the intraarticular area filled with color signals).

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Remission Based on Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count (DAS28) in Combination With Seven-Joint Ultrasound (US7) Measurement at Month 6 and Month 12</title>
          <description>Remission based on DAS28 + US7: DAS28 &lt;2.6 and US7 synovitis sum score in GSUS=0, PDUS=0 and US7 erosion sum score in GSUS=0. DAS28: SJC + TJC in 28 joints count + CRP(mg/L) or ESR(mm/hr) levels and PGA on 0-100 mm scale (0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicated worst health condition). U7 Remission: US7 synovitis sum score in GSUS=0, PDUS=0 and erosion sum score in GSUS=0. US7 score is MKUS composite scoring system which combined soft tissue lesions(synovitis) and destructive processes(erosions) in single scoring system. US7 score included MKUS examination of given joints: wrist, MCP II and III, PIP II and III, MTP II and V. Joints were examined by GSUS and PDUS for synovitis on scale of 0-3 (GSUS: 0=no synovitis, 3=severe synovitis; higher score=more synovitis); (PDUS: 0=no intraarticular color signal, 3 = &gt;=50% of intraarticular area filled with color signals). Erosions in GSUS and PDUS were calculated on binary basis 0 (no remission) and 1 (remission).</description>

        <description>DAS28 was a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, CRP (mg/L) or ESR (mm/hr) levels and PGA of disease activity on a 0-100 mm scale (scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicated worst health condition). DAS28 score range from 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity). DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt; 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 implied remission.</description>

        <description>US7 score was MKUS composite scoring system which combined soft tissue lesions (synovitis) and destructive processes (erosions) in a single scoring system. GSUS is a scoring system use to determine synovitis. The joints were examined by GSUS for synovitis from a dorsal and palmar aspect. The US7 synovitis sum score in GSUS was the sum of the scores for 9 following parts (wrist dorsal, wrist palmar, wrist ulnar, MCP 2 palmar, MCP 3 palmar, PIP 2 palmar, PIP 3 palmar, MTP 2 dorsal, MTP 5 dorsal) on a scale ranging from 0 =no synovitis to 3=severe synovitis. Total US7 GSUS score ranged from 0 (no synovitis) to 27 (severe synovitis), higher score= more synovitis.</description>

GSUS was a scoring system used to determine the erosions. The joints were examined by GSUS for erosions from a dorsal, palmar/plantar and radial/lateral (only MCP 2 and MTP 5) aspect. The US7 erosion sum score in GSUS was the sum of the 14 following scores (MCP 2 dorsal, MCP 2 palmar, MCP 2 radial, MCP 3 dorsal, MCP 3 palmar, PIP 2 dorsal, PIP 2 palmar, PIP 3 dorsal, PIP 3 palmar, MTP 2 dorsal, MTP 2 plantar, MTP 5 dorsal, MTP 5 plantar and MTP 5 lateral) ranging from 0 to 1. Total score ranged from 0 (no erosions) to 14 (severe erosions), higher score= more erosions. The score was based on measurements made at fingers and toes and were calculated for both left and right sides, the score of the clinically most affected side.</description>
