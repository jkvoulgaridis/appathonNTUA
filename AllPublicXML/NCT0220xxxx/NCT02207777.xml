  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this purpose, we will compare the effects of targeted 16-18% (with a range of 16-25%)
      weight loss induced by Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery with the same weight loss
      induced by a low-calorie diet (LCD) on liver and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity,
      beta-cell function, and 24-hour metabolic homeostasis in obese subjects with or without T2D.
