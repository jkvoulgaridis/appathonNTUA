    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate safety and efficacy
      of semaglutide once weekly in monotherapy or in combination with one OAD (oral anti-diabetic
      drug) in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes who are insufficiently controlled on
      diet/exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy.

      All subjects will continue their pre-trial treatment (diet and exercise therapy or OAD
      monotherapy in addition to diet and exercise therapy) during the trial.

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-56</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AEs) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. All AEs mentioned here are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment (week 0-56 treatment period) and no later than the follow-up visit during the on-treatment observation period (date of last dose + 42 days).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-56</time_frame>
    <description>Severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe and/or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value of &lt;56 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L), with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Severe hypoglycaemia: was an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. The episodes mentioned here are treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes and defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment (week 0-56 treatment period) and no later than the follow-up visit during the on-treatment observation period (date of last dose + 42 days).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 56</time_frame>
    <description>The observed mean change in HbA1c values from baseline after 56 weeks of treatment. Changes in HbA1c were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with treatment and pre-trial treatment at screening as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate. The data were analysed for the &quot;on-treatment without rescue medication&quot; observation period which includes observations noted at or after the date of first dose of randomised treatment and not after the last dose of the trial product (+ a 7-day visit window) or initiation of rescue medication.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 41 sites in Japan.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were either on diet and exercise therapy only or on stable treatment on oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) mono-therapy [either of sulphonyl urea (SU), glinide, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (α-GI) or thiazolidinediones (TZD)] within approved Japanese labelling in addition to diet and exercise therapy before week -2.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Semaglutide 0.5 mg</title>
          <description>Subjects were randomized to receive semaglutide 0.5 mg once weekly subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm for a period up to 56 weeks. The treatment period was divided into the dose escalation and the dose maintenance period. Subjects followed a fixed dose escalation pattern to mitigate tolerability concerns, starting with once-weekly doses of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks (4 doses), then escalated to once weekly 0.5 mg maintenance dose for 52 weeks (maximum dose). Doses were not changed during the trial after the maintenance dose was reached. Semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL was supplied in a 1.5 mL pre-filled PDS290 pen-injector and administered on the same day of every week during the trial. All subjects continued their pre-trial treatment of either diet and exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy in addition to diet and exercise throughout the trial.</description>

          <description>Subjects were randomized to receive semaglutide 1.0 mg once weekly subcutaneously (s.c.; under the skin) in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm for a period up to 56 weeks. The treatment period was divided into the dose escalation and the dose maintenance period. Subjects followed a fixed dose escalation pattern to mitigate tolerability concerns, starting with once-weekly doses of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks (4 doses), then escalated to once weekly doses of 0.5 mg for 4 weeks, and finally escalated to once weekly 1.0 mg maintenance dose for 48 weeks (maximum dose). Doses were not changed during the trial after the maintenance dose was reached. Semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL was supplied in a 1.5 mL pre-filled PDS290 pen-injector and administered on the same day of every week during the trial.

          <title>Additional OAD</title>
          <description>Subjects were randomised to receive one additional OAD in addition to the pre-trial treatment for a duration of 56 weeks. The type and dosage of the additional OAD was selected by the investigator according to the approved Japanese labelling based on drug combinations and contraindications. One of the following OADs was to be selected as the additional OAD therapy: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, SU, glinide, biguanide, α-GI and TZD. For subjects treated with OAD as pre-trial treatment, the type and dosage of the additional OAD with a different mechanism of action from the pre-trial OAD was to be chosen. The dose of the additional OAD was optimized within approved Japanese labelling until week 8 (dose adjustment period) and the dose remained unchanged until week 56 (maintenance dose) unless rescue medication was needed. The type of the additional OAD remained unchanged during the trial.</description>

            <description>Subjects were randomised to receive one additional OAD in addition to the pre-trial treatment for a duration of 56 weeks. The type and dosage of the additional OAD was selected by the investigator according to the approved Japanese labelling based on drug combinations and contraindications. One of the following OADs was to be selected as the additional OAD therapy: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, SU, glinide, biguanide, α-GI and TZD. For subjects treated with OAD as pre-trial treatment, the type and dosage of the additional OAD with a different mechanism of action from the pre-trial OAD was to be chosen. The dose of the additional OAD was optimized within approved Japanese labelling until week 8 (dose adjustment period) and the dose remained unchanged until week 56 (maintenance dose) unless rescue medication was needed. The type of the additional OAD remained unchanged during the trial.</description>

        <description>Severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe and/or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value of &lt;56 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L), with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Severe hypoglycaemia: was an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. The episodes mentioned here are treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes and defined as an event that had onset date (or increase in severity) on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment (week 0-56 treatment period) and no later than the follow-up visit during the on-treatment observation period (date of last dose + 42 days).</description>
