      Determine which remission criterion at Month 6 predicts remission at Month 12 the best.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on a logistic regression defining the
      dependent variable as the remission at Month 12 and the 6 independent variables as ASAS
      partial remission, ASAS 5/6, ASAS60, ASAS40, BASDAI50 and ASDAS inactive disease status.

      This analysis will be conducted in each arm of the study as well as after a pooling of both
      patient groups.

      In this context it seems reasonable to ensure the completion of the study by a total
      approximate number of 100 patients (approximately 50 patients per arm). In order to ensure 50
      completers in each arm, 70 patients will be recruited at baseline, taking into account a
      drop-out rate of 30% over 1 year period.

    <description>BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participant with AS by measuring participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation. Participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation was measured on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher degree of pain/discomfort/inflammation. The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity.

        <description>ASAS partial remission was defined as a score of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2 for each of the 4 items including pain, function, participant global assessment (PGA) and inflammation. All these items were measured on a scale ranging from 0-10, where 0= no disease activity and 10= high disease activity.</description>

The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated lesser movement of participant due to AS. BAS-G was used to measure spinal pain on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated worsen health status.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score Based on Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ASDAS-ESR) Remission Criteria at Month 6 and Maintained Till Month 12</title>
        <description>ASDAS-ESR was based on 3 domains: BASDAI, BAS-G and ESR (in millimeter per hour). BASDAI was used to measure disease activity by measuring participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher degree of pain/discomfort/inflammation. The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated lesser movement of participant due to AS. BAS-G was used to measure spinal pain on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated worsen health status. Scores from these 3 individual domains were averaged to calculate the ASDAS- ESR total scores. ASDAS- ESR remission was defined as having total ASDAS- ESR score of &lt;1.3 on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity.</description>

        <description>BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participant with AS by measuring participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation. Participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation was measured on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher degree of pain/discomfort/inflammation. The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity. BASDAI 50 remission was defined as at least &gt;=50 percent relative improvement from baseline in BASDAI total score.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 Remission Criteria at Month 3, 6, 9 and 12</title>
          <description>BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participant with AS by measuring participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation. Participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation was measured on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher degree of pain/discomfort/inflammation. The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity. BASDAI 50 remission was defined as at least &gt;=50 percent relative improvement from baseline in BASDAI total score.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Score at Month 6 and 12</title>
          <description>BASFI was a functional index which included 10 items assessing ability of participants to perform normal daily activities. Each item was scored on a scale of 0=easy, to 10=impossible. The BASFI total score was calculated as the average score of these 10 individual items. BASFI total score ranged from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated more severe disease activity.</description>

Participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation was measured on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher degree of pain/discomfort/inflammation. The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated high disease activity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score Based on Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ASDAS-ESR) at Month 6 and 12</title>
          <description>ASDAS-ESR was based on 3 domains: BASDAI, BAS-G and ESR (in millimeter per hour). BASDAI was used to measure disease activity by measuring participant's pain, discomfort and inflammation on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher degree of pain/discomfort/inflammation. The total BASDAI score was calculated as average of individual scores and ranged from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher score indicated lesser movement of participant due to AS. BAS-G was used to measure spinal pain on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated worsen health status. Scores from these 3 individual domains were averaged to calculate the ASDAS- ESR total scores. ASDAS- ESR remission was defined as having total ASDAS- ESR score of &lt;1.3 on a scale ranging from 0= none to 10= severe, where higher scores indicated higher disease activity.</description>
          <population>Completers analysis data set included all participants enrolled in the study, who completed the 12-month study, whether or not they missed some follow-up visits, and regardless of the cohort.</population>
