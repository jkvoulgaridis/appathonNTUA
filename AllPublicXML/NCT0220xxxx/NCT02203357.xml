  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and Anti-HBV antibody
      persistence of hepatitis B vaccine with different doses and schedules. Hepatitis B vaccine
      with the regimens of 20μg, 0-1-6 mon and 60μg,0-1 or 0-2 mon will be administered to young
      adults, and the comparative immunogenicity among the three groups will be measured at 1 mon
      post-a series vaccination, 1- and 2-year after the first dose of the regimen. Furthermore,
      the safety of hepatitis B vaccine with different doses and schedules will also be evaluated.

    <description>The measurements of anti-HBs antibodies were determined quantitatively by CMIA using the Architect i2000SR analyzer (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). The accepted protective serum anti-HBs level was ≥10 mIU/ml. Anti-HBs≥10 and &lt; 100 mIU/ml were considered low response, and anti-HBs concentrations ≥100 but &lt; 1000 mIU/ml were middle or moderate response, and hyper or high response was associated with an anti-HBs level ≥1000 mIU/ml.
The GMCs of anti-HBs antibody will be compared among the three vaccine groups.</description>

    <measure>Safety of HBV Vaccine Determined by Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 day after the first dose of immunization</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were monitored for any adverse events occurring within 30 min after each injection for immediate reactions and instructed to measure axillary temperature and record selected injection-site reactions (pain, erythema, induration, swelling, pruritus, cutaneous rash) and systemic reactions (headache, vomiting, asthenia, allergic reaction, fatigue, diarrhea, myalgia, general malaise, etc.) on the day of vaccination and the subsequent 3 days. Adverse reactions were graded or categorized according to the standard guideline for adverse reactions grading in vaccine clinical trials as Grade 1−3.</description>

        <title>Immunogenicity of Hepatitis B Vaccine With Different Doses and Schedules in Healthy Young Adults</title>
        <description>The measurements of anti-HBs antibodies were determined quantitatively by CMIA using the Architect i2000SR analyzer (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). The accepted protective serum anti-HBs level was ≥10 mIU/ml. Anti-HBs≥10 and &lt; 100 mIU/ml were considered low response, and anti-HBs concentrations ≥100 but &lt; 1000 mIU/ml were middle or moderate response, and hyper or high response was associated with an anti-HBs level ≥1000 mIU/ml.
The GMCs of anti-HBs antibody will be compared among the three vaccine groups.</description>

          <description>The measurements of anti-HBs antibodies were determined quantitatively by CMIA using the Architect i2000SR analyzer (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). The accepted protective serum anti-HBs level was ≥10 mIU/ml. Anti-HBs≥10 and &lt; 100 mIU/ml were considered low response, and anti-HBs concentrations ≥100 but &lt; 1000 mIU/ml were middle or moderate response, and hyper or high response was associated with an anti-HBs level ≥1000 mIU/ml.
The GMCs of anti-HBs antibody will be compared among the three vaccine groups.</description>
