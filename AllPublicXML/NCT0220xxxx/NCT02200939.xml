      The purpose of this study is to evaluate bioinduction of new tissue and tendon healing after
      implantation of the Rotation Medical Bioinductive Implant used as either a standalone device
      or adjunct to surgical repair in the treatment of supraspinatus tendon tears.

    <description>For tendon defects treated by standalone use of the device (i.e., implantation without surgical repair using sutures/suture anchors), post-operative follow-up MRIs will be used to estimate the amount of defect fill-in with newly induced tissue and the quality of the filled-in tissue. In the absence of fill-in with newly induced tissue, defect progression (i.e., change in size relative to previous MRIs) will be assessed.</description>
