  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will examine the effects of hydromorphone, as compared to
      placebo, upon physiological, subjective, and hormonal responses to a stressful speech task
      and a non-stressful control task in healthy adults. There is strong evidence in support of
      the role of endogenous opioids and opiates in mediating social behavior in humans and other
      animals, and particularly, in social distress. The investigators have recently shown that
      buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, reduces cortisol responses to stress. Here, the
      investigators propose to further explore the role of the opioid system in mediating stress
      responses in humans through the use of hydromorphone, a full mu opioid agonist, in addition
      to acetaminophen. The investigators hypothesize that like acetaminophen, hydromorphone will
      reduce both physiological and subjective measures of stress.

      Participants be randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg acetaminophen, 2mg hydromorphone, 4mg
      hydromorphone, or placebo at each of two sessions; one during which they well participate in
      a stressful speaking task, and one during which they'll participate in a nonstressful control
      task. Physiological and subjective measures will be taken throughout each session.

    <measure>Subjective Effects as Assessed by Score on &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot; Subscales of the Drug Effects Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (time 0 and approximately 4 weeks later), week 4 reported.</time_frame>
    <description>The Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) is a visual analog scale questionnaire that assesses the extent to which subjects experience four subjective states: &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot;. The &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot; subscales are reported. All subscales are scored on a visual analogue scale (scroll bar on computer screen) ranging from 0-100. 100 represents the highest score for that subjective state, and the higher the score, the worse the outcome. The values shown below are only from week 4</description>

          <title>Subjective Effects as Assessed by Score on &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot; Subscales of the Drug Effects Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) is a visual analog scale questionnaire that assesses the extent to which subjects experience four subjective states: &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot;. The &quot;Feel Drug&quot;, &quot;Feel High&quot;, &quot;Like Drug&quot;, and &quot;Want More&quot; subscales are reported. All subscales are scored on a visual analogue scale (scroll bar on computer screen) ranging from 0-100. 100 represents the highest score for that subjective state, and the higher the score, the worse the outcome. The values shown below are only from week 4</description>
