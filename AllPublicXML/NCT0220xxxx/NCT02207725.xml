    <measure>Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in Anti-fXa Activity at the Nadir (Parts I and II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to +2 minutes or +5 minutes following the end of andexanet/placebo bolus (Part I), or 10 minutes prior to end of andexanet/placebo continuous infusion or 5 minutes after the end of andexanet/placebo continuous infusion (Part II)</time_frame>
    <description>In Part I, the primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in anti-fXa activity at the nadir, when nadir was defined as the smaller value for anti-fXa activity at the +2 minutes or +5 minutes time point following the end of the bolus. In Part II, the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in anti-fXa activity from its baseline to nadir, when nadir was defined as the smaller value for anti-fXa activity between the 110-minute time point (10 minutes prior to the end of the continuous infusion) and the 5-minute time point after the end of the continuous infusion. The baseline for the primary endpoint in both parts was the anti-fXa activity just prior to administration of andexanet, 3 hours following the Day 4 dose of apixaban. Anti-fXa activity was measured by a modified chromogenic assay.</description>

In Part II, the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in anti-fXa activity from its baseline to nadir, when nadir was defined as the smaller value for anti-fXa activity between the 110-minute time point (10 minutes prior to the end of the continuous infusion) and the 5-minute time point after the end of the continuous infusion. The baseline for the primary endpoint in both parts was the anti-fXa activity just prior to administration of andexanet, 3 hours following the Day 4 dose of apixaban. Anti-fXa activity was measured by a modified chromogenic assay.</description>

          <description>In Part I, the primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in anti-fXa activity at the nadir, when nadir was defined as the smaller value for anti-fXa activity at the +2 minutes or +5 minutes time point following the end of the bolus. In Part II, the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in anti-fXa activity from its baseline to nadir, when nadir was defined as the smaller value for anti-fXa activity between the 110-minute time point (10 minutes prior to the end of the continuous infusion) and the 5-minute time point after the end of the continuous infusion. The baseline for the primary endpoint in both parts was the anti-fXa activity just prior to administration of andexanet, 3 hours following the Day 4 dose of apixaban. Anti-fXa activity was measured by a modified chromogenic assay.</description>
