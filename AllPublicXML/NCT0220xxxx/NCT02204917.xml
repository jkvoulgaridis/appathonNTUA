    <textblock>
      Contrast enhanced Voiding Urosonography (ceVUS) is a radiation free, highly sensitive imaging
      modality for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urethral imaging in children. It employs
      ultrasound technology in combination with ultrasound contrast agent, which is administered
      intravesically via a bladder catheter. Currently, second generation ultrasound contrast
      agents are commercially available, comprising of gas-filled microbubbles. CeVUS in children
      is being widely practiced, primarily in Europe, despite the fact that none of the
      commercially available ultrasound contrast agents are yet approved for clinical applications
      in pediatric population. In the United States, there is limited clinical experience with
      ceVUS in children. Among the currently commercially available ultrasound contrast agents,
      OPTISON has already been used in research and off-label in clinical settings involving adults
      and children. One in-vitro study has been conducted aiming to optimize the ultrasound
      technical parameters and the dose of OPTISON for intravesical administration in children. In
      this clinical trial the investigators aim to evaluate the diagnostic feasibility and safety
      of ceVUS with the intravesical use of OPTISON for vesicoureteral reflux detection and
      urethral imaging in children.

    <measure>Number of Pelvic-ureter-units (PUUs) Detected With Vesicoureteral Reflux by Contrast Enhanced Voiding Urosonography (ceVUS) and by Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG).</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux identified by ceVUS and VCUG in each pelvic-ureter-unit (PUU) of each participant. PUU is an anatomic term that is used to describe the part of the urinary tract consisting of the renal calyces, pelvis and ureter.
Grading the severity of reflux detected by ceVUS and VCUG. Grade 0: absence of reflux. If reflux is present, a 5 grade scale (grades I-V) is used to evaluate its severity. Grade I: reflux in the ureter, grade II: reflux up to the renal pelvis, grade III: reflux up to the renal pelvis with mild dilation of the ureter and pelvicalyceal system, grade IV reflux up to the renal pelvis with moderate dilation but preserved papillary impressions, grade V: reflux up to the renal pelvis with severe dilation and loss of papillary impressions. Higher grades of reflux are associated with increased risk of urinary tract infection.
Imaging of the urethra during voiding (urethra visualized or not) and urethra pathology detection.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events Following Contrast Enhanced Voiding Urosonography (ceVUS) With OPTISON and Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG).</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 hour and up to 2 days after ceVUS and VCUG examinations completion.</time_frame>
    <description>The overall safety and tolerability of ceVUS with OPTISON was assessed before, during and immediately after each ceVUS and VCUG examinations, and in follow-up telephone interviews. Assessments included:
evaluation of body systems for signs of generalized hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactoid reactions
monitoring of heart rate and pulse oxygen saturation
telephone questionnaire-based interview of parents/guardians and children 48 hours after the examinations for delayed adverse events.
The severity of any possible adverse event was classified as mild, moderate or serious and the onset of symptoms was categorized as acute, subacute or delayed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications. In addition, the adverse event was classified as anticipated if it was expected given the study related procedures or unanticipated if the subject was exposed to greater risk than previously known or recognized.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>From September 2014 to April 2015, the study team recruited and enrolled 31 eligible subjects scheduled for the clinically indicated voiding cysteourethrography (VCUG) examination from the daily inpatients/outpatients program of the Radiology Department at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>One subject was enrolled into the study (informed consent signed), however, sedation was required as standard of care to perform the clinically indicated VCUG examination. Sedation constitutes an exclusion criterion. Therefore, this subject although enrolled into the study, did not actually complete it.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux identified by ceVUS and VCUG in each pelvic-ureter-unit (PUU) of each participant. PUU is an anatomic term that is used to describe the part of the urinary tract consisting of the renal calyces, pelvis and ureter.
Grading the severity of reflux detected by ceVUS and VCUG. Grade 0: absence of reflux. If reflux is present, a 5 grade scale (grades I-V) is used to evaluate its severity. Grade I: reflux in the ureter, grade II: reflux up to the renal pelvis, grade III: reflux up to the renal pelvis with mild dilation of the ureter and pelvicalyceal system, grade IV reflux up to the renal pelvis with moderate dilation but preserved papillary impressions, grade V: reflux up to the renal pelvis with severe dilation and loss of papillary impressions. Higher grades of reflux are associated with increased risk of urinary tract infection.

        <description>The overall safety and tolerability of ceVUS with OPTISON was assessed before, during and immediately after each ceVUS and VCUG examinations, and in follow-up telephone interviews. Assessments included:
evaluation of body systems for signs of generalized hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactoid reactions
monitoring of heart rate and pulse oxygen saturation
telephone questionnaire-based interview of parents/guardians and children 48 hours after the examinations for delayed adverse events.
The severity of any possible adverse event was classified as mild, moderate or serious and the onset of symptoms was categorized as acute, subacute or delayed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications. In addition, the adverse event was classified as anticipated if it was expected given the study related procedures or unanticipated if the subject was exposed to greater risk than previously known or recognized.</description>
