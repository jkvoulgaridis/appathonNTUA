    <textblock>
      Pilot study to determine the feasibility and possible treatment effect of a multi-component
      intervention combining non-drug treatments for urinary incontinence and physical activity to
      improve urinary incontinence, toileting skills, physical function, and quality of life in
      frail older women without dementia living in senior housing facilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single blinded, two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial designed to test the
      feasibility and potential treatment effects of a multi-component intervention that combined
      behavioral urinary incontinence treatments with physical activity to improve urinary
      incontinence, toileting skills, quality of life, and physical function in frail older women
      without dementia living in senior apartment buildings.The intervention included a 12-week
      program of tailored behavioral UI treatments delivered by a nurse practitioner during 4 home
      visits, 150 minutes of weekly walking, and twice weekly strength training classes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance Oriented Timed Toileting Instrument (POTTI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A performance based measure that takes less than 5 minutes to administer. Participants are timed as they complete tasks that simulate toileting including: rising from a chair, walking 15 feet to another chair, turning around, pulling down an elastic waist skirt worn over their typical clothing, sitting in the chair, grabbing a piece of toileting paper and throwing it into a wastebasket, rising and pulling the skirt back up. Longer times indicate greater difficulty with toileting. It has strong inter-rater and test-retest reliability (90% agreement) and has been validated with activities of daily living dependency (r= -.721, p&lt;.001) in nursing home residents (Ouslander et al., 1987). It has demonstrated responsiveness to change in a recent clinical trial (van Houten et. al., 2007).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Toileting Skills Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A five item toileting skills questionnaire that assesses participants level of difficulty with undressing, walking to the toilet, getting on and off the toilet, reaching to grab toilet paper, and reaching around to wipe their bottom. Responses for each item range from 0-no difficulty to 4-cannot do. Total scores range from 0-20. Higher scores indicate more difficulty.</description>

    <measure>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A four item questionnaire reporting the frequency and amount of urine leakage, how much leakage interferes with everyday life, and when leaking occurs. Scores range from 0-21 with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Environmental toileting barriers checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Observation of environmental barriers to toilet access, i.e., inappropriate toilet seat height, grab bar placement, trip hazards on pathway to toilet, adequate lighting in bathroom and pathways to toilet and other barriers to easy toileting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The IIQ is a questionnaire with 30 items measuring the impact urinary incontinence has on social, physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of life. All items contain the same response options (0=not at all, 1=slightly, 2= moderately, 3=greatly) and scores range from 0-90.</description>

    <measure>Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after completing 12 week intevention</time_frame>
    <description>The UDI has 20 items asking about how much urinary incontinence bothers the respondent. All items contain the same response options (0=not at all, 1=slightly, 2= moderately, 3=greatly) and scores range from 0-60.</description>

    <description>12 week multi-component program. Continence program administered by a nurse practitioner during 4 home visits. Participants do pelvic floor muscle exercises 5 days/week using a 13-minute instructional audio CD. Based on participant symptoms and preferences the following strategies are taught: bladder training, urge and suppression techniques, caffeine reduction, eliminating bladder irritants, medication adjustment, adequate fluid intake, constipation management, and reducing nocturia.
2. Physical activity program including moderate intensity walking (30 minutes, 5 days weekly) and twice weekly group strength training sessions using Therabands led by a trained exercise instructor.</description>
