  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multimorbidity move between multiple care settings, and so they are at high
      risk of receiving fragmented care leading to increased risk for avoidable illness, death, and
      health care costs. Recent Canadian studies and reports identify significant gaps in the
      delivery of effective care to patients with multiple chronic conditions in community-based
      settings.

      The overall goal of the intervention is to promote successful management of chronic
      conditions, enhance quality of life, reduce the on-demand use of expensive health services
      and support primary caregivers (i.e. family or friends) who provide physical, emotional or
      financial care to an older adult with multimorbidity. This research program will leverage the
      tremendous potential to reduce the burden of multimorbidity by enhancing community-based
      prevention and chronic disease management.

      This pragmatic mixed-methods randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of
      an interprofessional team-based self-management intervention on health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL), depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, and the costs of use of health services for
      older adults with multimorbidity receiving home care and their family caregivers. The results
      will inform: (1) the development of national standards for community-based care for patients
      with multimorbidity and (2) the development of a new and innovative community-based model for
      the management of multimorbidity that can be scaled up and spread across Canada.

      Research Question:

      What is the acceptability and effects of a six-month self-management program compared to
      usual home care services for older adults with multimorbidity and their family and friend
      caregivers?

      Methods:

      The design is a pragmatic, mixed-methods; randomized controlled trial with individuals newly
      referred to and using home care services. The intervention is a 6-month self-management
      program for older adults with multimorbidity. It will be provided by an interprofessional
      team of home care providers and will consist of three components: (1) intensive case
      management to facilitate access to services across the care continuum, provide psychosocial
      support and advocacy, and coordinate home care; (2) a minimum of two in-home visits by the
      Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) Case Manager, two visits by the Registered Nurse (RN),
      three visits by the Physiotherapist (PT) or Occupational Therapist (OT), and six visits by a
      Personal Support Worker (PSW) over 6 months in addition to usual home care services. The
      in-home visit schedule and team composition will be tailored to client needs and will be
      determined in collaboration with the home care providers. The interprofessional (IP) team
      will conduct comprehensive screening and assessments for chronic conditions, utilize
      strengths-based practice to encourage self-management and foster behavioural change, provide
      education for multimorbidity, medication review and management, in-home exercise, and
      caregiver support; and (3) monthly interprofessional team case conferences to develop an IP
      evidence-based, patient-centred care plan.

      Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6 months. Summary descriptive measures will be
      reported for all variables. Analysis of covariance will be used to compare study groups,
      while adjusting for baseline measurements and potential confounding variables. Subgroup
      analyses will be conducted based on sex/gender and region.

      Expected Outcomes:

      It is expected that older adults receiving the intervention will show greater improvements in
      health-related quality of life compared to usual home care services. These improvements will
      be achieved at no additional cost, from a societal perspective.
