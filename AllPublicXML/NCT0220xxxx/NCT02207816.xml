  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct long-term surveillance for efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of the GSK Biologicals RTS,S/AS01E candidate Plasmodium falciparum malaria
      vaccine in infants and children in Africa following a primary vaccination series
      (NCT00866619). No new subjects will be enrolled in this extension study.

    <description>Clinical malaria was defined as an episode of malaria with positive Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia, accompanied by the presence of fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C ) at the time of presentation or history of fever within 24 hours of presentation and occurring in a child who was unwell and brought for treatment to a healthcare facility.

        <title>Incidence of Severe Malaria Meeting Case Definition 1</title>
        <description>Case definition 1 for severe malaria was defined as an episode of malaria with positive Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia (within -1 to +3 days of admission) and with one or more marker of disease severity: Prostration, respiratory distress, Blantyre score equal to or less than (≤) 2, seizures 2 or more, hypoglycemia below (&lt;) 2.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), acidosis BE ≤ -10.0 mmol/L, lactate ≥ 5.0 mmol/L or anemia &lt; 5.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL). The incidence of severe malaria for case definition 1 is expressed as a person year rate for each group (n/T), representing the number of events (n) reported over the risk period, which was counted in days and expressed as person years at risk (T).</description>
        <time_frame>From Year 0 to Year 3 (Starting January 2014 and ending December 2016)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects that consented to the trial and received at least 1 dose of the corresponding study vaccine in Malaria-055 (NCT00866619) study.

          <description>Case definition 1 for severe malaria was defined as an episode of malaria with positive Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia (within -1 to +3 days of admission) and with one or more marker of disease severity: Prostration, respiratory distress, Blantyre score equal to or less than (≤) 2, seizures 2 or more, hypoglycemia below (&lt;) 2.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), acidosis BE ≤ -10.0 mmol/L, lactate ≥ 5.0 mmol/L or anemia &lt; 5.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL). The incidence of severe malaria for case definition 1 is expressed as a person year rate for each group (n/T), representing the number of events (n) reported over the risk period, which was counted in days and expressed as person years at risk (T).</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects that consented to the trial and received at least 1 dose of the corresponding study vaccine in Malaria-055 (NCT00866619) study.

        <title>Incidence of Clinical Malaria Meeting Case Definition</title>
        <description>Clinical malaria was defined as an episode of malaria with positive Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia, accompanied by the presence of fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C ) at the time of presentation or history of fever within 24 hours of presentation and occurring in a child who was unwell and brought for treatment to a healthcare facility. The incidence of clinical malaria for case definition 1 is expressed as a person year rate for each group (n/T), representing the number of events (n) reported over the risk period, which was counted in days and expressed as person years a t risk (T). Due to late protocol approvals and retrospective data collection the sites did not collect the data according to protocol and as such the case definition cannot be applied. For the final analysis, specific case definitions based on available data were developed.</description>

All vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral left thigh (GSK257049 vaccine); left deltoid (GSK257049 booster dose); anterolateral right thigh (Tritanrix HepB/Hib vaccine), except for the Polio Sabin vaccine, which was given orally. No vaccination was administered during this study.</description>

All vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral left thigh (GSK257049 vaccine); left deltoid (GSK257049 booster dose); anterolateral right thigh (Tritanrix HepB/Hib vaccine), except for the Polio Sabin vaccine, which was given orally. No vaccination was administered during this study.</description>

          <description>Case definition 2 for severe malaria was defined as an episode of malaria with positive Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia (within -1 to +3 days of admission) and with one or more marker of disease severity: Prostration, respiratory distress, Blantyre score equal to or less than (≤) 2, seizures 2 or more, hypoglycemia below (&lt;) 2.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), acidosis BE ≤ -10.0 mmol/L, lactate ≥ 5.0 mmol/L or anemia &lt; 5.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or SAE report including preferred terms (Malaria, Plasmodium falciparum infection or Cerebral malaria) within -1 to +3 days of admission. The incidence of severe malaria for case definition 2 is expressed as a person year rate for each group (n/T), representing the number of events (n) reported over the risk period, which was counted in days and expressed as person years at risk (T).</description>

        <title>Incidence of Clinical Malaria Meeting Case Definition</title>
        <description>Clinical malaria was defined as an episode of malaria with positive Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia, accompanied by the presence of fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C) at the time of presentation or history of fever within 24 hours of presentation and occurring in a child who was unwell and brought for treatment to a healthcare facility. The incidence of clinical malaria for case definition 1 is expressed as a person year rate for each group (n/T), representing the number of events (n) reported over the risk period, which was counted in days and expressed as person years at risk (T). Due to late protocol approvals and retrospective data collection the sites did not collect the data according to protocol and as such the case definition cannot be applied. For the final analysis, specific case definitions based on available data were developed.</description>

        <description>Malaria SAEs were defined as SAEs coded by MedDRA preferred term level as 'malaria', 'Plasmodium falciparum infection' or 'cerebral malaria&quot;. A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or resulted in disability/incapacity. SAEs disclosed in this outcome are any SAEs , fatal SAEs, those that were related to vaccine administration in the primary study MALARIA-055 PRI (110021) and malaria hospitalization.</description>
