  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the feasibility and the tolerability of a tethered
      spectrally encoded confocal microscopy (SECM) capsule and to use it to image the esophagus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      72 subjects including healthy volunteers, patients with a suspicion of having Eosinophilic
      Esophagitis (EoE) and patients with a clinical diagnosis of EoE will be recruited and asked
      to swallow the SECM capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule is attached to a
      tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses
      down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis.

      As the capsule progresses, multiple 2-dimensional cross sectional images of the esophagus are
      acquired. Images are analyzed at a later stage.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative assessment of the Feasibility of SECM Capsule and Imaging in EoE participant versus Healthy Controls</measure>
    <time_frame>A single 20 minute visit (5-7 minute imaging).</time_frame>
    <description>An investigator will qualitatively assess the quality of the recorded images and movies obtained with each exam after the imaging is completed. The images obtained by the SECM Capsule will be compared to the images obtained by clinical endoscopy if available.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability of SECM Capsule Imaging Procedure in Healthy and EoE Participant, measured by feedback scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire adminstered directly after the imaging portion has been completed.</time_frame>
    <description>After participating in the study, the subject will be asked for feedback about tolerability of the procedure using a questionnaire. This entails questions about comfort levels and the participants ability to tolerate the tether and capsule during the whole and parts of the procedures.</description>
