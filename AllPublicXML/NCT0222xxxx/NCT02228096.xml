             T-cell Antibodies: Administration of any T cell lytic or toxic antibody (e.g.

             may destroy the infused CTL019 cells and/or prevent their in vivo expansion. If such
             an agent has been administered within 8 weeks prior to CTL019, contact the Sponsor,
             consider consultation with an pharmacology expert, and consider measuring residual
             drug levels, if feasible, prior to CTL019 infusion Women of child-bearing potential
             (defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant) and all male
             participants, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception for a
             period of 1 year after the CTL019 infusion. Highly effective contraception methods
             include:

               1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               2. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               3. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient

               4. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%),
                  for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception

               5. Use of IUDs are excluded due to increased risks of infection and bleeding in this
                  population. However, IUD inserted prior to consent may remain in place, and a
                  second method of contraception is mandated

               6. In case of use of oral contraception, women must be stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

        Women who are not of reproductive potential (defined as either &lt;11 years of age, Tanner
        Stage 1, post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. have had no menses) or
        have undergone hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy) are
        eligible without requiring the use of contraception. Women who are not yet of reproductive
        potential are to agree to use acceptable forms of contraception when they reach
        reproductive potential if within 1 year of CTL019 or if CAR cells are present in the blood
        by PCR. Acceptable documentation includes written or oral documentation communicated by
        clinician or clinician's staff of one of the following:

          1. Demographics show age &lt; 11

          2. Physical examination indicates Tanner Stage 1

          3. Physician report/letter

          4. Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record

          5. Discharge summary

          6. Follicle stimulating hormone measurement elevated into the menopausal range
