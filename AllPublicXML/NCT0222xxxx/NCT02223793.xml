      The overall goal of the present project is to contribute to new knowledge about the effect of
      a low threshold population screening system for cardiovascular risk factors in Norway.
      Further, this project aim to study if identifying high cardiovascular risk itself may lead to
      beneficial changes in health behaviors such as physical activity, diet, tobacco and alcohol
      behavior together with reduced risk score of cardiovascular disease, across socioeconomic
      status. This fall, a nationwide, free screening of cardiovascular risk factors will be
      conducted in 150 pharmacies in Norway. All participants that consent to participate will
      measure full lipid-profile, blood pressure, HbA1c, body weight and height by health care
      providers in pharmacies. Based on their measurement levels, participants will be stratified
      into either a low or a high risk group. In the high risk group, participants will further be
      randomized to either the intervention group or one of the two control groups. Participants in
      the intervention group will be informed about all their measurement levels with comparison to
      the recommended levels. Contrary, participants randomized to the two control groups will have
      delayed information of their measured levels. Participants in the intervention group and the
      first control groups will receive general oral and written information about how to lower
      their measurement levels in 8 weeks. In the second control group, participants will not
      receive any information at the first visit. In this way the investigators may be able to
      isolate the effect of identifying high risk and high levels of the risk factors itself. All
      groups will be given a diet- and physical activity questionnaire at visit 1, and will be
      invited back after 8 weeks to once more perform the measurement screening and receive the
      same questionnaire. At visit 2, all participants will, after the measurement screening, be
      informed about their measured risk factors and receive information on how to lower their
      levels. 1 year after inclusion, all participants in the three groups will be invited back for
      a one-year follow up visit in pharmacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One year after inclusion, all participants that were not loss to follow up, or had their
      consent withdrawn, were invited back to pharmacies to perform the same measurements for the
      third time. However, at this third visit, pharmacies were randomized 1:2 to test an
      additional intervention. Further, an extra blood sample, dried blood spot, was taken to
      measure cholesterol, HbA1c and fatty acids.

      About half of the pharmacies (n=23) communicated cardiovasular disease (CVD) risk factor
      levels as Heart age compared to own age (British communication tool) together with tailored
      lifestyle advices on how to reduce elevated levels. While the other 25 pharmacies
      communicated CVD risk the usual way and gave general lifestyle advices on how to reduce CVD
      risk. 4 weeks later, all participants took dried blood spot samples at home. We will compare
      results from dried blood spot samples to study whether heart age and tailored lifestyle
      advice is more effective than general information in reducing CVD risk.

      The investigators will also record social security number to make connection to central
      health registry as prescription registry, patient registry and cause of death registry after
      2 years and 5 years.

    <description>The (ad hoc) risk score was a summarization of points ranging from 0 (favorable measures) , 2 (slighly unfavourable) or 4 (very unfavorable measures) assigned for each of Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index and age (age was included because presence of elevated cardiovascular disease risk factors is more alarming in younger age).
Risk points for each risk factor was summarized into an total risk score ranging from 4 (min) to 14 (max). A total risk score of ≥4 served as inclusion criteria because it indicated moderately elevated risk of cardiovascular disease.</description>

          <title>Ad hoc risk score</title>
          <description>Ad hoc riskscore IS a summarization of scores ranging from zero (favorablemeasures) to four (very unfavorable measures), assigned for each of TC, HDL-C, HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI and age. A risk score of≥4 served as inclusion criteria because it indicated moderately elevated risk of CVD (minimum score). Maximum score was 14.</description>

        <description>The (ad hoc) risk score was a summarization of points ranging from 0 (favorable measures) , 2 (slighly unfavourable) or 4 (very unfavorable measures) assigned for each of Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index and age (age was included because presence of elevated cardiovascular disease risk factors is more alarming in younger age).
Risk points for each risk factor was summarized into an total risk score ranging from 4 (min) to 14 (max). A total risk score of ≥4 served as inclusion criteria because it indicated moderately elevated risk of cardiovascular disease.</description>
