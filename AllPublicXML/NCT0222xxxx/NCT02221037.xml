  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung injury in patients undergoing oesophagectomy may occur during surgery (peri-operatively)
      as a result of One Lung Ventilation (OLV) and/or during the immediate post-operative period
      when patients receive intensive care. This is reinforced by the observation that
      physiological markers of lung injury are most elevated immediately after completion of
      surgery, and the development of clinical Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)occurs
      immediately post-operatively (within 72 hours of surgery), with the majority of cases
      reported 24-48 hours after completion of surgery. This study is designed to investigate the
      impact of pre-operative administration of GSK2862277 on biological and physiological markers
      of lung injury in patients undergoing surgical resection of oesophageal cancer in order to
      achieve optimal exposure at the site of injury following OLV and lung deflation. This study
      is a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind, multi-centre, single dose parallel group,
      design. There will be two treatment groups comprising one active and one placebo arm with
      approximately 40 patients per group. Patients enrolled in the study will be scheduled to
      undergo planned/elective trans-thoracic surgery for oesophagectomy. The primary endpoint for
      this study is the change in pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) from pre-surgical
      levels to the end of surgery. GSK2862277 will be administered as an orally inhaled aerosol
      (single nebulized dose) over approximately 3 to 5 minutes (min) 1-3 hours prior to surgery.
      Subject will be monitored daily until discharge and followed up till day 28.

    <measure>Baseline Adjusted Change in Pulmonary Vascular Permeability Index (PVPI) on Completion of Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 [immediately prior to start of surgery]) and Day 1 (on completion of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>PVPI is a derived value from extra vascular lung water (EVLW), and is considered to be less variable than extra vascular lung water Index (EVLWI). PVPI was measured via single-indicator transpulmonary thermodilution with a patent indwelling Pulse Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO) catheter. Baseline was Day 1 (immediately prior to start of surgery). Change from Baseline value was the post-Baseline value (on completion of surgery on Day 1) minus Baseline value. Per-Protocol 1 (PP1) Population comprised of all the participants in the Safety population for whom the treatment actually received was the same one when they were randomized to (both study drug and BAL sampling location).</description>

        <title>Baseline Adjusted Change in Pulmonary Vascular Permeability Index (PVPI) on Completion of Surgery</title>
        <description>PVPI is a derived value from extra vascular lung water (EVLW), and is considered to be less variable than extra vascular lung water Index (EVLWI). PVPI was measured via single-indicator transpulmonary thermodilution with a patent indwelling Pulse Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO) catheter. Baseline was Day 1 (immediately prior to start of surgery). Change from Baseline value was the post-Baseline value (on completion of surgery on Day 1) minus Baseline value. Per-Protocol 1 (PP1) Population comprised of all the participants in the Safety population for whom the treatment actually received was the same one when they were randomized to (both study drug and BAL sampling location).</description>

        <title>Baseline Adjusted Change in EVLWI on Completion of Surgery</title>
        <description>EVLW refers to the fluid within the lung but outside the vascular compartment. It includes extravasated plasma, intracellular water, lymphatic fluid, and surfactant. EVLWI was measured by trans-pulmonary thermodilution via a PiCCO hemodynamic monitor. Baseline was Day 1 (immediately prior to start of surgery). Change from Baseline value was the post-Baseline value (on completion of surgery on Day 1) minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</title>
        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to MP. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with use of MP. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant or all events of possible drug induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia.

        <description>Urinalysis included dipstick urine test which was used to screen for glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein on Day 1 (pre-dose) and Day 8. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters of urine glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein can be read as Trace, 1+, 2+ and 3+, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample.</description>

        <title>Baseline Adjusted Change in PaO2/FiO2 on Completion of Surgery</title>
        <description>Oxygenation and function of gas exchange was assessed by the comparison of partial pressure of oxygen arterially (PaO2) divided by the fraction of oxygen that is being inspired (FiO2), sometimes referred to simply as the 'P to F ratio'. The P to F ratio was assessed at time points during the period of intubation and mechanical ventilation. An arterial blood sample was required for determination of the partial pressure of oxygen and the percentage of O2 which is being inspired was recorded at the corresponding time point. Baseline was Day 1 (immediately prior to start of surgery). Change from Baseline value was the post-Baseline value (on completion of surgery on Day 1) minus Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Baseline Adjusted Change in PaO2/FiO2 on Completion of Surgery</title>
          <description>Oxygenation and function of gas exchange was assessed by the comparison of partial pressure of oxygen arterially (PaO2) divided by the fraction of oxygen that is being inspired (FiO2), sometimes referred to simply as the 'P to F ratio'. The P to F ratio was assessed at time points during the period of intubation and mechanical ventilation. An arterial blood sample was required for determination of the partial pressure of oxygen and the percentage of O2 which is being inspired was recorded at the corresponding time point. Baseline was Day 1 (immediately prior to start of surgery). Change from Baseline value was the post-Baseline value (on completion of surgery on Day 1) minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Levels of BAL Biomarkers on Completion of Surgery</title>
        <description>Samples were collected to determine concentrations of biomarkers in BAL using an appropriately validated assay on Day 1 after completion of surgery. BAL biomarkers included soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (STNFR) type I, free, STNFR type I, total, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 1 beta, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta, interleukin 10 and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end (sRAGE) products. Any value below limit of quantification was replaced with half the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) prior to deriving the summary measures. Mean levels of BAL biomarkers on completion of surgery are presented. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=X,X,X,X in the category titles.</description>

        <title>Levels of BAL Biomarkers (C-reactive Protein and Total Proteins) on Completion of Surgery</title>
        <description>Samples were collected to determine concentrations of biomarkers in BAL using an appropriately validated assay. BAL biomarkers included C-reactive protein and total proteins. Any value below limit of quantification was replaced with half the LLQ prior to deriving the summary measures. All BAL C-reactive protein samples were below limit of quantification and all were assigned to half the LLQ prior to deriving the summary measures. Mean levels of BAL biomarkers on completion of surgery are presented. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=X,X,X,X in the category titles.</description>

        <title>Change Over Time in PaO2/FiO2 Post-operatively on Day 2 Through to Day 4</title>
        <description>Oxygenation and function of gas exchange was assessed by the comparison of PaO2 divided by the FiO2, sometimes referred to simply as the 'P to F ratio'. The P to F ratio was assessed at time points during the period of intubation and mechanical ventilation. An arterial blood sample was required for determination of the partial pressure of oxygen and the percentage of O2 which is being inspired was recorded at the corresponding time point. Baseline was Day 1 (immediately prior to start of surgery). Change from Baseline value was the post-Baseline value (on completion of surgery on Day 1) minus Baseline value. PP1 Population was analyzed. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=X,X in the category titles.</description>

          <description>Half-life (t1⁄2) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value. t1/2 was not determined in all cases due to insufficient data in the terminal phase. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of GSK2862277 were collected at the indicated time points. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=X,X in the category titles.</description>
