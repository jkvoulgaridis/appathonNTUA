      To evaluate the efficacy of GWP42003-P as adjunctive treatment in reducing the number of drop
      seizures when compared with placebo, in participants with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS).

    <textblock>
      This study was a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, 14-week comparison of 20 milligram [mg] per
      kilogram [kg] per day [mg/kg/day] of GWP42003-P versus placebo. The treatment period
      consisted of a 2-week titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period. The study
      determined the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P compared with placebo. The
      dose was recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) after assessment of
      safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A of study GWEP1332. The first participants
      enrolled into this study after the DSMC reviewed the safety data from Part A of study
      GWEP1332. Following study completion, all participants were invited to continue to receive
      GWP42003-P in an open label extension (OLE) study (under a separate protocol).

    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT) (Day 99) or Early Termination (ET)</time_frame>
    <description>Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary. Drop seizures were defined as the subset of tonic-clonic, tonic or atonic seizures that were reported as drop seizures in the IVRS. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as: (frequency during the treatment period - frequency during baseline/frequency during baseline) * 100. The frequency during each period was based on 28-day averages and calculated as: (number of seizures in the period/number of reported days in the IVRS period) *28. Baseline included all available data prior to Day 1 (28-day average). Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <description>Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an IVRS diary. Drop seizures included the subset of tonic-clonic, tonic or atonic seizures that were reported as drop seizures in IVRS. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as per the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline In Total Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to EOT (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>Total seizures included the sum of all seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic, clonic, myoclonic, countable partial, other partial and absence seizures) recorded by the participant or caregiver using an IVRS diary. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as per the primary outcome measure. Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Subject/Caregiver Global Impression Of Change Assessment (S/CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The S/CGIC was used to assess the participant's overall condition on a 7-point scale, using the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse, or very much worse&quot; (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the S/CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits. If both a CGIC and SGIC were completed then the CGIC was used; if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used; if only a SGIC was completed then the SGIC was used. Last visit for endpoints assessed at clinic visits was defined as the last scheduled visit (not including the end of taper or safety follow-up visits) at which participant's last evaluation was performed.</description>

             ULN or international normalized ratio &gt;1.5). This criterion can only be confirmed once
             the laboratory results are available; Participants randomized into the study who are
             later found not to meet this criterion should be withdrawn from the study.

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline In Drop Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary. Drop seizures were defined as the subset of tonic-clonic, tonic or atonic seizures that were reported as drop seizures in the IVRS. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as: (frequency during the treatment period - frequency during baseline/frequency during baseline) * 100. The frequency during each period was based on 28-day averages and calculated as: (number of seizures in the period/number of reported days in the IVRS period) *28. Baseline included all available data prior to Day 1 (28-day average). Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

          <title>Percentage Change From Baseline In Total Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Total seizures included the sum of all seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic, clonic, myoclonic, countable partial, other partial and absence seizures) recorded by the participant or caregiver using an IVRS diary. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as per the primary outcome measure. Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Subject/Caregiver Global Impression Of Change Assessment (S/CGIC)</title>
        <description>The S/CGIC was used to assess the participant's overall condition on a 7-point scale, using the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse, or very much worse&quot; (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the S/CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits. If both a CGIC and SGIC were completed then the CGIC was used; if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used; if only a SGIC was completed then the SGIC was used. Last visit for endpoints assessed at clinic visits was defined as the last scheduled visit (not including the end of taper or safety follow-up visits) at which participant's last evaluation was performed.</description>
