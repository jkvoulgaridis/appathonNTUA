  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is aimed at understanding behaviors and brain circuits that relate to
      anxiety and depression. Our goal is to learn which circuits of the brain are involved in
      anxiety and how these circuits might affect daily functioning.

      This study has recently added an additional treatment component: participants undergo a 12
      week course of either Pramipexole medication or rTMS therapy (explained below). The ultimate
      goal of the study is to offer participants experiencing anxiety and depression a treatment
      that is alternative to ones that have failed them in the past, and to apply the knowledge we
      gain from investigating the brain circuits involved in anxiety and depression to help
      personalize treatments.

      We invite anyone who has recently experienced any symptoms of anxiety and/or depression to
      participate (no diagnosis is required to participate).

      If you are eligible and choose to participate, we'll ask you to come in for 2 separate
      testing visits and 8 weeks of treatment in between.

      In both the pre-treatment and post-treatment testing visit, you would complete game-like
      tasks on the computer, undergo a non-invasive MRI brain scan, and answer some questions about
      your emotional health. The entire visit takes place during 1-2 days at Stanford and lasts
      about 4-5 hours. We'll also ask you to complete a follow-up 12 weeks later, from home, during
      which we'll again ask you some questions on your emotional health.

      The 8-week treatment phase will consist of your choice of either TMS (transcranial magnetic
      stimulation) or Pramipexole (a medication for depression). You will meet with study
      coordinators and MDs each week (Pramipexole) or each day (TMS) to receive treatment. You will
      also be asked to complete weekly online surveys to monitor your mood during the 2-month
      course of treatment.

      To inquire more about participation, you can either sign up online or contact us.

        We expect to enroll 160 individuals spanning the spectrum of anxiety and associated mood
        symptoms. These individuals include patients of the Gronowski Center, a community clinical
        psychology center in Palo Alto. We will also recruit from the community through various
        advertisements. Further, participants will include healthy people recruited by
        advertisement.
