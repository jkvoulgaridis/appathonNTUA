  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand hygiene is the single most effective practice in preventing the spread of
      hospital-acquired infections. Despite the strength of the evidence, hospital staff continue
      to sanitize their hands less than half of the time required by guidelines. Effective
      interventions are needed to improve hand hygiene compliance rates among hospital staff, but
      most are of poor quality and do not examine the specific effects of individual interventions.
      This study will build a &quot;bundle&quot; of three hand hygiene interventions using a research design
      that allows for the effectiveness of each intervention to be measured individually and
      combined.

      The two specific aims and associated hypotheses of CREATE Project 2 include:

        1. Identify combinations of hand-hygiene intervention strategies that optimize hand-hygiene
           compliance and that could form an evidence-based hand-hygiene bundle for Veterans Health
           Administration (VHA) implementation.

           Hypothesis 1: Combinations of interventions will increase compliance rates more than
           single interventions.

           Aim 1 will entail a 30-month cluster-randomized controlled trial that will sequentially
           test three individual hand-hygiene interventions - hand-hygiene point-of-use reminder
           signs to serve as an environmental cue to action, individual hand sanitizers, and health
           care worker hand cultures - to identify an optimal combination of interventions to
           increase hand-hygiene compliance. The trial will be conducted in 59 hospital units in 10
           VA hospitals in order to test the efficacy of individual and then sequentially added
           interventions to determine their incremental impact on hand-hygiene compliance.

           The focus for this clinical trial will be on Aim 1--Single Hand Hygiene Sign changes.

        2. Identify institutional, organizational, ward/ICU, and individual level facilitators and
           barriers to implementing hand-hygiene interventions.

      Hypothesis 2: Facilitators and barriers will pattern around contextual factors such as level
      of leadership support and organization of infection control programs.

      Aim 2 will entail a qualitative process evaluation that includes site visits to purposefully
      selected sites, semi-structured interviews, and observations to examine barriers and
      facilitators to the interventions and develop contextual insight for implementing and
      scaling-up the intervention at additional sites as a national initiative.

Compliance rates will be determined using the same methods of direct observation of HCWs developed by Dr. Perencevich for his VA Health Services Research &amp; Development (HSR&amp;D) funded study (IIR 09-099). Compliance will be collected monthly throughout the project for each of the 59 units.</description>
          <population>Entry and exit HH compliance were calculated for units in each treatment group. Crude (unadjusted) change in HH compliance from baseline to follow-up was assessed for each intervention group using Fisher’s exact test.</population>
