      The purpose of this study is to examine the brain functioning of OCD patients and healthy
      controls before and after treatment with Exposure and Response Prevention (EXRP) therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to coordinate thoughts and actions to execute goal-directed behaviors (cognitive
      control) and the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and learn from reward (reward
      processing) are key processes for human behavior. Dysfunction in these processes has been
      hypothesized to contribute to repetitive thoughts and behaviors in many disorders, including
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and eating disorders. We will
      use multimodal imaging to investigate neural circuits that support cognitive control and
      reward processing, using OCD as a model system. The short-term goal is to clarify how
      circuit-based abnormalities contribute to repetitive thoughts/behaviors; these data will
      inform future transdiagnostic studies. The long-term goal is to identify control and reward
      circuit-abnormalities as targets for new transdiagnostic treatments.
