      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GWP42003-P as adjunctive
      treatment in reducing the number of drop seizures when compared with placebo in participants
      with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).

      This study was a 1:1:1 randomized, double-blind, 14-week comparison of 2 dose levels (10
      milligram [mg] per kilogram [kg] per day [mg/kg/day] and 20 mg/kg/day) of GWP42003-P versus
      placebo. Participants who satisfied all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria began a
      28-day baseline observation period. The treatment period consisted of a 2-week titration
      period followed by a 12-week maintenance period. The 20 mg/kg/day dose was recommended by the
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) after assessment of safety and pharmacokinetic data
      from Part A of study GWEP1332 (NCT02091206). The 10 mg/kg/day dose was defined as 50% of the
      20 mg/kg/day dose. The first participant was not enrolled into this study until the DSMC had
      reviewed the safety data from Part A of study GWEP1332.

      Participants who satisfied all eligibility criteria were randomized at Day 1 to receive 10
      mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, or placebo at a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants in
      the placebo group were split into 2 equivalent cohorts; one half received 10 mg/kg/day dosing
      volumes and one half received 20 mg/kg/day dosing volumes. The 2 placebo cohorts were pooled
      for the analyses of efficacy. Participants titrated GWP42003-P to the 10 mg/kg/day or 20
      mg/kg/day (or equivalent volume of placebo) dose over 7 and 11 days, respectively, and
      remained at this dose for the 12-week maintenance period. Following the end of treatment (Day
      99), participants were invited to continue to receive GWP42003-P in an open-label extension
      (OLE) study under a separate protocol (GWEP1415; NCT02224573). All participants who did not
      immediately enter the OLE study tapered investigational medicinal product (IMP) (10% per day
      over 10 days). However, the taper period could be interrupted if the participant wished to
      enter the OLE study within a 7-day timeframe. Participants who down-titrated IMP returned for
      an end of taper period visit (Day 109). Participants who did not enter the OLE study or who
      withdrew prematurely had a safety follow-up visit 28 days later (Day 137).

    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT) (Day 99) or Early Termination (ET)</time_frame>
    <description>Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary. Drop seizures were defined as the subset of tonic-clonic, tonic or atonic seizures that were reported as drop seizures in the IVRS. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as: ([frequency during the treatment period - frequency during baseline]/frequency during baseline) x 100. The frequency during each period was based on 28-day averages and calculated as: (number of seizures in the period/number of reported days in the IVRS period) x 28. Baseline included all available data prior to Day 1 (28-day average). Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <description>Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an IVRS diary.

    <description>Total seizures included the sum of all seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic, clonic, myoclonic, countable partial, other partial, and absence seizures) recorded by the participant or caregiver using an IVRS diary. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as per the primary outcome measure. Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Subject/Caregiver Global Impression Of Change (S/CGIC) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit (Day 99) or ET</time_frame>
    <description>The S/CGIC was used to assess the participant's overall condition on a 7-point scale, using the markers &quot;very much improved, much improved, slightly improved, no change, slightly worse, much worse, or very much worse&quot; (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the S/CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits. If both a CGIC and SGIC were completed then the CGIC was used; if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used; if only a SGIC was completed then the SGIC was used. Last visit for endpoints assessed at clinic visits was defined as the last scheduled visit (not including the end of taper or safety follow-up visits) at which participant's last evaluation was performed.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>The dose levels of 10 and 20 milligram (mg) per kilogram (kg) per day (mg/kg/day) were recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of study GWEP1332 Part A (NCT02091206) after assessment of safety and pharmacokinetic data. Participants of GWEP1414 were not enrolled until the DSMC had reviewed the safety data of GWEP1332 Part A.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline In Drop Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary. Drop seizures were defined as the subset of tonic-clonic, tonic or atonic seizures that were reported as drop seizures in the IVRS. Percentage change from baseline was calculated as: ([frequency during the treatment period - frequency during baseline]/frequency during baseline) x 100. The frequency during each period was based on 28-day averages and calculated as: (number of seizures in the period/number of reported days in the IVRS period) x 28. Baseline included all available data prior to Day 1 (28-day average). Negative percentages show an improvement from baseline.</description>

On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the S/CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits. If both a CGIC and SGIC were completed then the CGIC was used; if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used; if only a SGIC was completed then the SGIC was used. Last visit for endpoints assessed at clinic visits was defined as the last scheduled visit (not including the end of taper or safety follow-up visits) at which participant's last evaluation was performed.</description>
