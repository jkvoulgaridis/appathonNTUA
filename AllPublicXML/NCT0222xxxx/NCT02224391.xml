    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well a smartphone-delivered attentional bias
      modification training works in helping patients quit smoking. Smartphone-delivered
      attentional bias modification training may help patients quit smoking by reducing the
      attentional bias (the tendency of one's perception to be affected by their recurring
      thoughts) towards smoking cues that developed over time as a result of conditioning processes
      through which smoking cues become important.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of smartphone-delivered, in-home attentional bias
      modification (ABM) to reduce attentional bias (AB) to smoking cues and to reduce smoking
      behavior in the short- and long-term.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ABM training over 30 minutes through a smartphone on days 1-14.
      Patients then receive nicotine patches for up to 8 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo sham training on days 1-14. Patients then receive nicotine patches
      for up to 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 15, 29, 43, 57, and 72.

    <measure>Impact of in-home attentional bias modification (ABM) on short- and long-term AB</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-training</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate this aim using mixed between-within repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Measured in the 3 laboratory sessions by including training (ABM versus [vs.] sham) as a between-subjects variable, laboratory session as a within-subjects variable, and their interaction. The number of in-home training sessions completed and accuracy rates will be included as covariates in all models. Will conduct separate analyses on the dependent measures reaction time and event-related potential P1.</description>

    <measure>Impact of in-home attentional bias modification (ABM) on smoking behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-training</time_frame>
    <description>For the continuous measures of smoking behavior, will conduct mixed between-within repeated measures ANOVA using the same predictors and covariates as previously described. Separate analyses will be run for each of the continuous dependent measures, including mean cigars per day (CPD) over the past 7 days, expired carbon monoxide (CO), cotinine, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief. For the categorical variable of 8-weeks post-nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) abstinence, will conduct a chi-square test of independence on the 2 (abstinent vs. nonabstinent) x 2 (ABM vs. sham training) table.</description>
