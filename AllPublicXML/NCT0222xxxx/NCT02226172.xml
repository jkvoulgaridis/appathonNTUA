  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A lead-in cohort of ~20 patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis previously treated
      with 1 or more Janus kinase inhibitors enrolled to single-agent glasdegib to evaluate safety
      and tolerability. Following the lead-in, a phase 2, double blind, 2-arm study, randomized 2:1
      to oral single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in 201 patients resistant or intolerant to
      ruxolitinib.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Week 131) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>MRI (CT scan may have been permitted if MRI was contraindicated) of the spleen and the liver was performed at baseline, then every 12 weeks while the participant was on treatment.

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MPN-SAD assessed the impact of 9 myelofibrosis symptoms, at their worst, over the past 7 days and over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The 9 symptoms are early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, pain below the ribs on the left-hand side, fatigue and shortness of breath. The TSS is the sum of the individual scores, excluding inactivity and shortness of breath. The TSS at Week 24 is the average of the daily total scores from the last 28 days of symptom scores immediately prior to Week 24. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>Anemia response was defined as transfusion-independent participants with a â‰¥20 gram per liter (g/L) increase in hemoglobin (Hb) level where baseline Hb level was &lt;100 g/L, or baseline transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion-independent post-baseline. Transfusion dependency before the start of study treatment was defined as transfusions of â‰¥6 units of packed red blood cells in the 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment, for a final pre-treatment Hb of &lt;85 g/L. In addition, the most recent transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days prior to study enrollment. Response in transfusion-dependent patients required absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive rolling 12-week interval during the treatment phase, capped by a Hb level of â‰¥85 g/L.</description>

                  platelet transfusions;

               3. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or estimated creatinine
                  clearance 60 mL/min (as calculated using the standard method of the institution);

               4. Serum amylase or lipase &lt;1.5 x ULN;

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase values 3.0 x ULN (or 5x
                  ULN in the case of patients with MF accompanied by hepatic extramedullary
                  hematopoiesis, as manifested by any degree of hepatomegaly).

               6. Total bilirubin values &lt;1.5 x ULN unless the bilirubin is principally
                  unconjugated (in the context of hemolysis) or there is documented Gilbert's
                  disease.

               7. Serum electrolyte values &lt; Grade 2 (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorous and
                  magnesium), per CTCAE v.4.03.

      <pre_assignment_details>In this study, 2 cohorts were involved lead-in and randomized cohort. Lead-in cohort was followed by randomized cohort. Though the drug was considered safe and tolerable in Myelofibrosis, but a key secondary efficacy outcome measure was not met. Therefore, continuation into the randomized cohort did not proceed.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The MPN-SAD assessed the impact of 9 myelofibrosis symptoms, at their worst, over the past 7 days and over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The 9 symptoms are early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, pain below the ribs on the left-hand side, fatigue and shortness of breath. The TSS is the sum of the individual scores, excluding inactivity and shortness of breath. The TSS at Week 24 is the average of the daily total scores from the last 28 days of symptom scores immediately prior to Week 24. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>

        <description>Anemia response was defined as transfusion-independent participants with a â‰¥20 gram per liter (g/L) increase in hemoglobin (Hb) level where baseline Hb level was &lt;100 g/L, or baseline transfusion-dependent patients becoming transfusion-independent post-baseline. Transfusion dependency before the start of study treatment was defined as transfusions of â‰¥6 units of packed red blood cells in the 12 weeks prior to start of study treatment, for a final pre-treatment Hb of &lt;85 g/L. In addition, the most recent transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days prior to study enrollment. Response in transfusion-dependent patients required absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive rolling 12-week interval during the treatment phase, capped by a Hb level of â‰¥85 g/L.</description>
