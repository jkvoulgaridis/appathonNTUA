    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 26 in Skin Globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) Score in Superficial Skin Capillary Endothelium: Number of Participants in Categories of Shift in GL-3 Score From Baseline to Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Skin biopsies taken at Baseline and Week 26 were analyzed for cellular GL-3 accumulation (inclusions) by light microscopy. Three independent pathologists evaluated each biopsy using an inclusion severity score of 0 (none/trace), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. A single score per participant per time point was derived by taking the score rated by a majority of the pathologists; if a majority score could not be derived, the median score was used. Data were summarized and reported in terms of number of participants with shift from Baseline GL-3 score to Week 26 GL-3 score. Any shift category of Baseline score/Week 26 score that was not observed is not reported. Shift to lower score from Baseline to Week 26 indicates less severe condition at Week 26.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 26 in Skin Globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) Score in Superficial Skin Capillary Endothelium: Number of Participants in Categories of Shift in GL-3 Score From Baseline to Week 26</title>
        <description>Skin biopsies taken at Baseline and Week 26 were analyzed for cellular GL-3 accumulation (inclusions) by light microscopy. Three independent pathologists evaluated each biopsy using an inclusion severity score of 0 (none/trace), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. A single score per participant per time point was derived by taking the score rated by a majority of the pathologists; if a majority score could not be derived, the median score was used. Data were summarized and reported in terms of number of participants with shift from Baseline GL-3 score to Week 26 GL-3 score. Any shift category of Baseline score/Week 26 score that was not observed is not reported. Shift to lower score from Baseline to Week 26 indicates less severe condition at Week 26.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 26 in Skin GL-3 Score in Deep Vessels Endothelial Cells: Number of Participants in Categories of Shift in GL-3 Score From Baseline to Week 26</title>
        <description>Skin biopsies taken at Baseline and Week 26 were analyzed for cellular GL-3 accumulation (inclusions) by light microscopy. Three independent pathologists evaluated each biopsy using an inclusion severity score of 0 (none/trace), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. A single score per participant per time point was derived by taking the score rated by a majority of the pathologists; if a majority score could not be derived, the median score was used. Data were summarized and reported in terms of number of participants with shift from Baseline GL-3 score to Week 26 GL-3 score. Any shift category of Baseline score/Week 26 score that was not observed is not reported. Shift to lower score from Baseline to Week 26 indicates less severe condition at Week 26.</description>
