  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GlaxoSmithKline's Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine pregnancy registry
      is established to meet a post marketing commitment agreed upon with CBER to prospectively
      collect data on pregnancy exposures to Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine.

      It is an observational study of women inadvertently immunized with the Meningococcal
      quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28 days prior to conception or at any time
      during pregnancy as part of routine care.

      The objective of the pregnancy registry is to evaluate pregnancy outcomes among women
      immunized with the Meningococcal quadrivalent CRM-197 conjugate vaccine within 28 days prior
      to conception or at any time during pregnancy. The primary outcomes of interest include major
      congenital malformation, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Other pregnancy outcomes will
      be collected, including spontaneous abortions and stillbirths.

    <description>A pregnancy outcome that is reported with a preterm birth represents an infant born at a gestational age under (&lt;) 37 weeks. The prevalence rate of preterm birth was calculated as a proportion, with the number of preterm births as the numerator and the number of live births as the denominator.

    <description>The pregnancy outcomes assessed were: live births, stillbirths, SABs, IABs, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy and others.
Spontaneous abortions (SABs) are defined as fetal death or expulsion of products of conception prior to 20 weeks gestation.
Induced abortions (IABs) are defined as voluntary interruption of pregnancy, including pregnancy termination that occurs electively, to preserve maternal health, or due to fetal abnormalities.
Stillbirths are defined as fetal death occurring at 20 weeks gestation or greater, or if gestation age is unknown, a fetus weighing 500 g or more.
Ectopic pregnancy is defined as implantation of a conception outside of the uterus.
Molar pregnancy is defined as a conception that results in a gestational trophoblastic tumor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             conception or at any time during pregnancy

          -  Sufficient information to determine whether the pregnancy is prospectively or

          -  Date the pregnancy exposure is registered

          -  Full reporter (ie, HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up (name, address,

        <description>The pregnancy outcomes assessed were: live births, stillbirths, SABs, IABs, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy and others.
Spontaneous abortions (SABs) are defined as fetal death or expulsion of products of conception prior to 20 weeks gestation.
Induced abortions (IABs) are defined as voluntary interruption of pregnancy, including pregnancy termination that occurs electively, to preserve maternal health, or due to fetal abnormalities.
Stillbirths are defined as fetal death occurring at 20 weeks gestation or greater, or if gestation age is unknown, a fetus weighing 500 g or more.
Ectopic pregnancy is defined as implantation of a conception outside of the uterus.
Molar pregnancy is defined as a conception that results in a gestational trophoblastic tumor.</description>
