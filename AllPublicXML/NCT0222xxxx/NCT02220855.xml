  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thymic tumors are rare tumors, but represent the most common tumors of the anterior
      mediastinum. Thymoma has an indolent course in advanced disease and has the propensity to
      spread to the pleura. In first line therapy, combination chemotherapy produces responses in
      approximately 80% of patients. A number of single agents have activity in recurrent disease,
      but none are curable. Patients with recurrent thymoma have limited treatment options, and
      thus novel target modalities are needed.

      At the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC), more patients with advance thymoma are
      seen than any other institution in the country. Our main hypothesis is the PI3K pathway is an
      important driver for growth and metastasis of thymoma and that inhibition of the PI3K pathway
      is expected to produce clinically meaningful response in patients with recurrent thymoma.

         23. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or adults of reproductive potential not
             employing an effective method of birth control. Double barrier contraceptives must be
             used through the trial by both sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives
             may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered
             effective for this study. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mature
             women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time
             in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤
             72 hours prior to initiating treatment.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL [for US only:
                  and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                  without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
                  only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment for 4
                  weeks (5 T1/2) (after stopping treatment... The highly effective contraception is
                  defined as either:

        1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
        subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)
        or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
        reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

        3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

        4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as
                  BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving
                  offspring must use condoms during treatment, for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping
                  treatment and for an additional 12 weeks (1616 weeks in total after study drug
                  discontinuation) and should not father a child in this period.

               -  Female partner of male study subject should use highly effective contraception
                  during dosing of any study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study
                  therapy.

                  24. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 25. History
                  of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the
                  skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix 26. Patient is unable or
                  unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the investigator

Disease control is defined as having a best response of Complete Response (defined as disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm) or Partial Response (defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions from the baseline sum diameters) or Stable Disease for at least 4 months (defined by neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progression) by RECIST v1.1 criteria.</description>
