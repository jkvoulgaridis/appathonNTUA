  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Domperidone is a drug that may be of benefit to individuals with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD), with upper GI symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation.

      This is a long-term treatment program for prescription of this drug to all patients who, in
      the investigators' judgement, could benefit from its use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Treatment Use of Domperidone program is also available at the Cleveland Clinic
      Florida/Weston Gastroenterology Department. This is not a &quot;traditional&quot; research study, but
      an expanded use protocol for patients who may benefit from the drug. Because of this, this
      study is enrolling patients via invitation only, and as such, all expenses associated with
      the drug, initiation and follow up of treatment are the responsibility of the patient or the
      patient's third party payer.
