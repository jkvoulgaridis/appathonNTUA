    <textblock>
      Berberine hydrochloride is a conventional component in Chinese medicine. In recent years,
      anticancer activity of berberine hydrochloride have been explored. The aim of this study is
      to investigate the effect of berberine hydrochloride on the recurrence of colorectal
      adenomas.

      Colorectal adenomas are well-known to be precancerous lesions that develop into colorectal
      cancers on the basis of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The effects of screening for
      colorectal adenomas and removing precancerous lesions on the prevention of colorectal cancer
      have been established. Because of the high recurrence rates of colorectal adenomas in
      patients who have undergone polypectomy, the potential chemopreventive agents that may reduce
      the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence need to be investigated.

      Berberine hydrochloride is a conventional component in Chinese medicine. In recent years,
      anticancer activity of berberine hydrochloride have been explored. The aim of this study is
      to investigate the effect of berberine hydrochloride on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas
      by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical.
