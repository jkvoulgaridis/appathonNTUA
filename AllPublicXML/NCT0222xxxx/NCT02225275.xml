  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide and obinutuzumab work in treating patients
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma that has come back
      (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and
      spread. Giving lenalidomide and obinutuzumab may work better in treating patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response defined as achievement of complete response (CR) or partial response
      (PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety of the combination. II. Response according to prognostic markers at diagnosis. III.
      Time to next treatment. IV. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 3-4 hours on days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of
      course 1 and day 1 of courses 2-6 and lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 9-28
      of course 1 and days 1-28 of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may
      continue to receive lenalidomide PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
