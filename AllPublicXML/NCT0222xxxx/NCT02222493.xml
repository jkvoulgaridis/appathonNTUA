    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 54 pre-dose), Week 62, 70 and 78</time_frame>
    <description>Tender joint count was an assessment of 68 joints (upper body, upper extremity, and lower extremity). Each joint's response to pressure/motion was assessed as: Present or Absent. Swollen joint count was an assessment of 66 joints (upper body, upper extremity, and lower extremity). Each joint was assessed for swelling as: Present or Absent.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 22 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>PAAP: Participants assessed the severity of their arthritis pain by using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe pain), which corresponded to the magnitude of their pain, where higher scores indicated more pain. PGA: Participants were asked the following question, &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?&quot; and their response was recorded on a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated worse health condition. PGAA: Participants were assessed how their overall arthritis appears at the time of the visit. The evaluation was based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the PAAP and PGA assessments. The physician's response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1603 participants were screened after signing an informed consent form, of whom 650 participants were randomized to receive study treatment. One (1) participant in the PF-06438179 arm was screened and randomized by 2 different study site personnel, and no data were collected for the participant's second randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>PF-06438179</title>
          <description>Participants received intravenous infusions of PF-06438179 at 3 mg/kg on Weeks 0, 2, 6 followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks at Weeks 14 and 22 in Period 1 which ended with the completion of the Week 30 pre-dose assessments. For participants who failed to achieve a minimum clinical response or lost clinical response (after Week 14 assessments), dose was increased to 5 mg/kg per infusion every 8 weeks. Participants initially randomized to PF-06438179 continued to blindly receive PF-06438179 in Period 2. A second randomization was blindly performed prior to dosing at Week 30 (at the beginning of Period 2, when participants initially randomized to INX were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with 50% of the participants switching to PF-06438179 and the other 50% of participants remaining on the INX arm. Period 3 started with dosing at Week 54 where all participants began open label treatment with PF-06438179.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score-CRP (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [CRP]) and HAQ-DI at Week 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 22 and 30: Period 1</title>
        <description>DAS28 is measure of disease activity in participants. DAS28-4 (CRP): calculated from SJC, TJC, CRP(mg/L) and PGA (participant rated disease activity on visual analogue scale [VAS] from 0 to 100 mm; high score=worse health). Total score range of DAS28-4 (CRP): 0 to 9.4(0=no activity; 9.4=extreme disease activity), higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4(CRP) less than (&lt;)2.6=remission, &lt;3.2=low disease activity, &gt;=3.2-5.1=moderate disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 5.1=high disease activity. HAQ-DI assess degree of difficulty a participant experienced (past week) in 8 domain of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each item scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3(0=no difficulty; 3=extreme difficulty). Overall score: sum of domain scores/number of domains answered. Total possible score range (0=least difficulty; 3=extreme difficulty); high scores=more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score-CRP (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [CRP]) and HAQ-DI at Week 38, 46 and 54: Period 2</title>
        <description>DAS28 is measure of disease activity in participants. DAS28-4 (CRP): calculated from SJC, TJC, CRP(mg/L) and PGA (participant rated disease activity on VAS from 0 to 100 millimeter [mm]; high score=worse health). Total score range of DAS28-4 (CRP): 0 to 9.4(0=no activity; 9.4=extreme disease activity), higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4(CRP) &lt;2.6=remission, &lt;3.2=low disease activity, &gt;=3.2-5.1=moderate disease activity and &gt;5.1=high disease activity. HAQ-DI assess degree of difficulty a participant experienced (past week) in 8 domain of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each item scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3(0=no difficulty; 3=extreme difficulty). Overall score: sum of domain scores/number of domains answered. Total possible score range (0=least difficulty; 3=extreme difficulty); high scores=more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score-CRP (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [CRP]) and HAQ-DI at Week 62, 70 and 78: Period 3</title>
        <description>DAS28 is measure of disease activity in participants. DAS28-4 (CRP): calculated from SJC, TJC, CRP(mg/L) and PGA (participant rated disease activity on VAS from 0 to 100 mm; high score=worse health). Total score range of DAS28-4 (CRP): 0 to 9.4(0=no activity; 9.4=extreme disease activity), higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4(CRP) &lt;2.6=remission, &lt;3.2=low disease activity, &gt;=3.2-5.1=moderate disease activity and &gt;5.1=high disease activity. HAQ-DI assess degree of difficulty a participant experienced (past week) in 8 domain of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each item scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3(0=no difficulty; 3=extreme difficulty). Overall score: sum of domain scores/number of domains answered. Total possible score range (0=least difficulty; 3=extreme difficulty); high scores=more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) and Disease Activity Score (DAS &lt;2.6) Remission: Period 1</title>
        <description>ACR/EULAR remission was considered if the scores on tender joint count, swollen joint count, hs-CRP (mg/dL), and patient's global assessment of arthritis (PGA) all were less than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 or the score on the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) was =&lt;3.3. SDAI was calculated as the sum of number of tender and swollen joint count (using 28 joints), PGA, physician global assessment, and CRP (mg/dL). PGA was assessed on a 10 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor), where higher scores indicate worse health condition. Physician global assessment was recorded on a 10 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity. DAS28 calculated from number of swollen joints and painful joints using the 28 joints count, CRP (mg/dL) and PGA using a 10 mm-VAS from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor), where higher scores indicate worse health condition. DAS28 &lt;3.2: low disease activity, DAS28 &lt;2.6: remission.</description>

        <description>ACR/EULAR remission was considered if the scores on tender joint count, swollen joint count, hs-CRP (mg/dL), and PGA all were =&lt;1 or the score on the SDAI was =&lt;3.3. SDAI was calculated as the sum of number of tender and swollen joint count (using 28 joints), PGA, physician global assessment, and CRP (mg/dL). PGA was assessed on a 10 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor), where higher scores indicate worse health condition. Physician global assessment was recorded on a 10 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity. DAS28 calculated from number of swollen joints and painful joints using the 28 joints count, CRP (mg/dL) and PGA using a 10 mm-VAS from 0 (very well) to 10 (very poor), where higher scores indicate worse health condition. DAS28 &lt;3.2: low disease activity, DAS28 &lt;2.6: remission.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Treatment Related TEAEs: Period 1</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 30 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Treatment-related TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 54 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Treatment-related TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>PAAP: Participants assessed the severity of their arthritis pain by using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe pain), which corresponded to the magnitude of their pain, where higher scores indicated more pain. PGA: Participants were asked the following question, &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?&quot; and their response was recorded on a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated worse health condition. PGAA: Participants were assessed how their overall arthritis appears at the time of the visit. The evaluation was based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the PAAP and PGA assessments. The physician's response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity.</description>

The evaluation was based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the PAAP and PGA assessments. The physician's response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity.</description>
          <population>The ITT Population was defined as all participants who were randomized to study treatment. Here, &quot;Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>PAAP: Participants assessed the severity of their arthritis pain by using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe pain), which corresponded to the magnitude of their pain, where higher scores indicated more pain. PGA: Participants were asked the following question, &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?&quot; and their response was recorded on a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated worse health condition. PGAA: Participants were assessed how their overall arthritis appears at the time of the visit. The evaluation was based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the PAAP and PGA assessments. The physician's response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity.</description>

        <description>PAAP: Participants assessed the severity of their arthritis pain by using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe pain), which corresponded to the magnitude of their pain, where higher scores indicated more pain. PGA: Participants were asked the following question, &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?&quot; and their response was recorded on a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated worse health condition. PGAA: Participants were assessed how their overall arthritis appears at the time of the visit. The evaluation was based on the participant's disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the PAAP and PGA assessments. The physician's response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor), where higher scores indicated more disease activity.</description>
