    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With ≥ 50% Reduction in Menstrual Blood Loss as Assessed by Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with a minimum of 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-procedure compared to baseline as assessed by PBAC. Success for individual subjects was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss and a final PBAC score &lt; 250. Endpoint success was defined as the lower confidence limit of the percentage of subject success ≥ 45%. The PBAC is a validated tool used to diagnose heavy menstrual bleeding and track menstrual bleeding. Women were asked to record daily use of tampons and sanitary towels by placing a tally mark under the day next to the box that represented how stained the sanitary materials were each time they were changed during the menstrual cycle. The tally marks were added up depending on the saturation level to provide a score. The score does not have an upper limit as it is not a &quot;scale&quot;. PBAC ≥ 150 is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Without Surgical Re-intervention for Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Due to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint computed the rate of not having a surgical reintervention for heavy menstrual bleeding due to treatment failure. As the success criterion for this endpoint was &quot;no surgical reintervention for HMB due to treatment failure at 12 months&quot;, the endpoint assessed the rate of subjects without surgical reintervention success due to treatment failure within the 12-month post-treatment period. Rate was calculated using the life-table method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change in Total and Perfused Mean Maximal Fibroid Volumes at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The percent change in total and perfused volume of dominant fibroid were determined by comparing contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and at 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Symptom Severity Score (SSS) and Quality of Life (HR-QoL) Subscales of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) Questionnaire at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Symptom Severity Score (SSS) and Health-Related Quality of Life Score (HR-QoL) are calculated from a subset of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) questionnaire, a validated and fibroid-specific assessment tool. The UFS-QoL is a uterine fibroid-specific questionnaire developed to evaluate the symptoms of uterine fibroids and their impact on quality of life related to health. SSS and HR-QoL subscale scores are summed and transformed into a 0-100 point scale. The SSS and HR-QoL subscale scores are inversely related with higher SSS indicating greater symptoms while higher HR-QoL scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General Health State at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in general health state was assessed with the EuroQOL EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, EuroQOL EQ-5D provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D consists of five questions that provide a description of the patient's health state with scores ranging from 0 (indicating death) to 1 (indicating perfect health). An increase of 0.04 in EQ-5D is considered by health economists to represent a minimally important difference.</description>

          <description>The PBAC is a validated assessment tool to estimate menstrual blood loss using icons representing various degrees of saturation of sanitary products. It is not a scale, but rather an index with values ≤100 to have been reported to represent eumenorrhea. In this study, women had to have heavy menstrual bleeding marked by a baseline PBAC of &gt;=150 and &lt;=500 to be eligible for study participation.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With ≥ 50% Reduction in Menstrual Blood Loss as Assessed by Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC)</title>
        <description>The proportion of subjects with a minimum of 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-procedure compared to baseline as assessed by PBAC. Success for individual subjects was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss and a final PBAC score &lt; 250. Endpoint success was defined as the lower confidence limit of the percentage of subject success ≥ 45%. The PBAC is a validated tool used to diagnose heavy menstrual bleeding and track menstrual bleeding. Women were asked to record daily use of tampons and sanitary towels by placing a tally mark under the day next to the box that represented how stained the sanitary materials were each time they were changed during the menstrual cycle. The tally marks were added up depending on the saturation level to provide a score. The score does not have an upper limit as it is not a &quot;scale&quot;. PBAC ≥ 150 is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding.</description>

        <description>The Symptom Severity Score (SSS) and Health-Related Quality of Life Score (HR-QoL) are calculated from a subset of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) questionnaire, a validated and fibroid-specific assessment tool. The UFS-QoL is a uterine fibroid-specific questionnaire developed to evaluate the symptoms of uterine fibroids and their impact on quality of life related to health. SSS and HR-QoL subscale scores are summed and transformed into a 0-100 point scale. The SSS and HR-QoL subscale scores are inversely related with higher SSS indicating greater symptoms while higher HR-QoL scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in General Health State at 12 Months</title>
        <description>Change in general health state was assessed with the EuroQOL EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, EuroQOL EQ-5D provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D consists of five questions that provide a description of the patient's health state with scores ranging from 0 (indicating death) to 1 (indicating perfect health). An increase of 0.04 in EQ-5D is considered by health economists to represent a minimally important difference.</description>
