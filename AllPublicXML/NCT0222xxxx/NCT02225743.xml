    <textblock>
      Total joint patients have poor outcomes with infection since they are having permanent
      hardware implanted. Infection prevention in this group is therefore critical and a major
      source of discussion in both the orthopedic and anesthesia literature.

      Hypothermia has been shown to increase the risk of infection and blood loss. However, studies
      have not examined when in the operation or how fast patients temperatures drop. This study
      will observe how patients' temperatures change during total joint arthroplasty. By
      identifying when body temperature changes occur, prevention strategies may be developed and
      implemented.

      Peri-operative hypothermia can have deleterious effects. While there is no standard
      consistent definition within the literature mild hypothermia is commonly defined as a core
      temperature between 34 and 36 °C. Mild hypothermia has been shown to increase the occurrence
      of surgical site infections, cardiac morbidity, coagulopathy leading to increased blood loss
      and transfusion requirements, impaired drug metabolism, and prolonged emergence from
      anesthesia. In addition, there is evidence that maintaining intra-operative normothermia can
      shorten hospital length of stay. Despite the fact that intra-operative temperature monitoring
      and warming are considered standard of care, peri-operative hypothermia in total joint
      arthroplasty patients remains an issue for several reasons. A large proportion of patient
      undergoing joint replacement are elderly, making them susceptible to peri-operative
      hypothermia. In addition, regional anesthesia causes vasodilation and promotes heat flow from
      the core to the periphery and impairs central and autonomic thermoregulation such that
      patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia can be particularly susceptible to perioperative
      hypothermia. Finally, core temperature monitoring is typically not used during regional
      anesthesia and hypothermia may go undetected for long periods of time.

      The primary goal of this study was to examine the incidence of hypothermia during lower
      extremity arthroplasty. A secondary aim was to identify patient and operative factors
      associated with hypothermia in order to improve future preventative strategies. Our
      hypothesis was that peri-operative hypothermia occurs in the majority of patients undergoing
      lower extremity arthroplasty. In addition, we hypothesized that certain patient and
      anesthetic factors (such as low body mass index and receiving general anesthesia) would
      increase the incidence of hypothermia.

    <description>The incidence of ever being hypothermic (temperature &lt; 36.0 °C at one or more measurements) was the primary outcome. All temperatures were assessed with an Exergen temporal thermometer (precise to 0.1 °C). Each temporal measurement was taken and recorded three times for accuracy and the mean value utilized for data analysis at each time point. Temperatures were measured upon (1) leaving holding area; (2) operating room (OR) arrival; (3) after anesthetic induction; (4) upper body forced air warmer initiation (used for all patients); (5) incision; (6-8) every 30 minutes after incision; (9) leaving the OR; and (10) arrival to PACU. OR temperature and humidity were recorded throughout.</description>
