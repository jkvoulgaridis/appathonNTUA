      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bilateral lateral rectus muscle
      recession versus unilateral lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection procedures
      for the treatment of basic type and pseudo divergence excess type intermittent exotropia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent exotropia (IXT) is the most common form of childhood onset exotropia with an
      incidence of 32.1 per 100,000 in children under 19 years of age. Intermittent exotropia is
      characterized by an exotropia that is not constant and is mainly present when viewing at
      distance, but may also be present at near. Normal binocular single vision (BSV) is typically
      present at near when the exotropia is controlled, with evidence of normal (occasionally
      sub-normal) stereoacuity. Although the natural history of the condition is largely unknown,
      many children with IXT are treated using either surgical or non-surgical interventions. The
      rationale for intervention in childhood IXT is that extended periods of misalignment may lead
      to entrenched suppression, resulting in loss of BSV. Intervention may also aim to address the
      social effects caused by the appearance of misaligned eyes. Many children treated for IXT are
      currently treated surgically.

      There is poor agreement as to which type of surgery is most effective for the correction of
      IXT and the debate has long been related to differentiation between IXT sub-types. Based on
      distance-near angle disparity, IXT sub-types are classified as: 1) basic (similar magnitude
      of misalignment at distance and near); 2) true divergence excess (larger at distance); 3)
      pseudo divergence excess (initially larger at distance, but near angle increases following
      occlusion or with addition of plus lenses at near); 4) convergence insufficiency (larger at
      near). Basic and pseudo divergence excess appear to be the most common of the sub-types, and
      are also the types for which there is most disagreement regarding the optimum surgical
      approach. The two most common procedures are bilateral lateral rectus recession (BLRrec) and
      unilateral lateral rectus recession combined with a medial rectus resection in the same eye
      (R&amp;R). Traditionally, BLRrec has been advocated where there is a larger distance angle, and
      R&amp;R where there is a similar angle at distance and near. A survey of American strabismus
      surgeons published in 1990 found that the majority performed BLRrec for both basic and
      divergence excess types. Similarly, we found by polling our investigator group that the
      majority still perform a BLRrec for basic type IXT. Nevertheless, controversy still exists as
      to which of these surgical approaches is superior. Advocates of the BLRrec procedure tend to
      hold that surgery should be based purely on the distance angle of deviation. Proponents of
      R&amp;R surgery suggest resection of the medial rectus best addresses the exodeviation at near.

      The proposed advantage of the R&amp;R procedure is that resecting the medial rectus, with a
      possible longer term initial overcorrection, is necessary for a stable and superior long-term
      outcome. Nevertheless, those who favor the BLRrec procedure suggest that the more profound
      and prolonged initial overcorrection occurring with R&amp;R is not only unnecessary, but may in
      fact be harmful. A persistent overcorrection may be associated with the development of
      diplopia, amblyopia, and loss of stereoacuity. On the other hand, critics of the BLRrec
      procedure suggest that long-term recurrence rates are higher. Poor motor outcomes are likely
      to require reoperation and therefore the long-term success rates of these surgeries have
      public health importance in terms of cost to society.

      Evaluating initial and long-term surgical outcomes in the proposed randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) will answer questions regarding the failure rates of these surgeries and also provide
      needed data on the potential harm of each procedure.

      Only one prospective randomized clinical trial addresses success rates of BLRrec versus R&amp;R
      for IXT. After between 12-15 months of follow up, 82% of 17 patients undergoing an R&amp;R had a
      satisfactory outcome compared to 52% of 19 patients undergoing a BLRrec. Nevertheless, there
      are some important limitations of this previous study. The sample size was very small. The
      study population was a sub-group of patients with basic type IXT, excluding patients with
      basic IXT whose angle of deviation increased at far distance or following occlusion, thus
      limiting the generalizability of the results. In addition, outcomes were assessed unmasked,
      potentially biasing the results. One observational study of 103 patients (90% of whom had
      basic type IXT) found 1-year success rates of 56% for BLRrec and 60% for R&amp;R. A retrospective
      study of 115 patients with basic type IXT reported success rates of 69% for BLRrec and 77%
      for R&amp;R after an average of 15 months of follow up. Other studies comparing surgery types are
      limited not only by retrospective study design but also by inclusion of other types of
      exotropia, making it difficult to interpret results. In addition, many different criteria for
      success are used, precluding meaningful comparison of success rates between studies. This
      lack of evidence makes it very difficult to counsel parents of children with IXT regarding
      the likely success and complication rate of either procedure, limiting our ability to make
      informed management decisions. Establishing the respective failure rates through the proposed
      study will allow physicians to offer patients the type of surgery with the highest chance of
      long-term success, minimizing suboptimal results and repeat surgeries.

      The present study is being conducted to compare the effectiveness of BLRrec with R&amp;R for the
      surgical treatment of basic type and pseudo divergence excess type IXT.

Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by at least 3 cover/uncover tests—one must be before any dissociation) with a magnitude of ≥6Δ by SPCT, confirmed by a retest
Decrease in Randot Preschool near stereoacuity ≥2 octaves (≥0.6 log arcsec) from enrollment, or to nil, confirmed by a retest</description>

          -  Intermittent exotropia (manifest deviation) meeting all of the following:

               -  Intermittent exotropia at distance OR constant exotropia at distance and either
                  intermittent exotropia or exophoria at near

               -  Largest exodeviation at either distance, near OR remote distance between 15 and
                  50 prism diopters (PD) (inclusive) by prism and alternate cover test (PACT)

               -  Exodeviation at least 15 PD at distance and near by PACT

               -  Basic type or pseudo divergence excess type

          -  Stereoacuity of 400 arcsec or better at near by Preschool Randot stereotest (better of
             2 measures)

          -  Visual acuity in the worse eye at least 0.3 logMAR (20/40 on ATS HOTV or 70 letters on

          -  No interocular difference of visual acuity more than 0.2 logMAR (2 lines on ATS HOTV
             or 10 letters on E-ETDRS testing)

          -  Absence of high AC/A ratio (exclude &gt; 6:1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Coexisting vertical deviation, oblique muscle dysfunction, dissociated vertical
             deviation (DVD), or A or V pattern, any of which the investigator plans to address
             with vertical transposition of horizontal rectus muscles, oblique surgery, or vertical
             rectus muscle surgery, i.e., only small vertical deviations, oblique muscle
             dysfunction, DVD, and A or V patterns not requiring surgery are allowed

          -  Interocular visual acuity difference of more than 0.2 logMAR (2 lines on ATS HOTV for
             patients 3 to &lt; 7 years old or 10 letters on E-ETDRS for patients ≥ 7 years old)
             and/or investigator plans to initiate amblyopia treatment at this time.

          -  High AC/A ratio (exclude &gt; 6:1 by gradient method)

          -  Prior strabismus surgery or botulinum toxin injection

          -  Ocular disorders that would reduce visual acuity (except refractive error)

          <title>Distance Randot Stereoacuity (log arcsec)</title>
          <description>Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40). Seconds of arc refers to the visual angle that is being measured in order to determine depth perception. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores to the log scale to calculate descriptive statistics (reported as seconds of arc, or arcsec).</description>

Exotropia at distance OR near at any time during the exam (i.e., can be constant or intermittent; determined by a cover/uncover test) with a magnitude of ≥10Δ by SPCT, confirmed by a retest
Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by at least 3 cover/uncover tests—one must be before any dissociation) with a magnitude of ≥6Δ by SPCT, confirmed by a retest
Decrease in Randot Preschool near stereoacuity ≥2 octaves (≥0.6 log arcsec) from enrollment, or to nil, confirmed by a retest Participants who underwent reoperation (or treatment with botulinum toxin) without first meeting any of the above suboptimal surgical outcome criteria were also counted as suboptimal surgical outcomes in the primary analysis.</description>

All 3-year visit data will be analyzed regardless of what treatment(s) a patient has received and regardless of whether the patient has undergone reoperation. Control at distance was analyzed as a continuous variable and compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANOVA) models that adjust for the corresponding baseline value (e.g. ANCOVA model of 3-year distance control will adjust for baseline distance control).
Numeric values for exotropia control were assigned so that the following categories were created:

        <title>Mean Distance PACT at 3 Years</title>
        <description>The prism and alternate cover test (PACT) is used to measure the angle of strabismus, or deviation, in prism diopters. This is measured separately at distance and at near. Smaller numbers are better because they indicate a smaller angle of deviation. Mean PACT was assessed in all patients who completed the 3-year visit. All 3-year visit data will be analyzed regardless of what treatment(s) a patient has received and regardless of whether the patient has undergone reoperation. PACT was analyzed as a continuous variable and compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANOVA) models that adjust for the corresponding baseline value (e.g. ANCOVA model of 3-year PACT at distance will adjust for baseline PACT at distance).</description>

        <description>The prism and alternate cover test (PACT) is used to measure the angle of strabismus, or deviation, in prism diopters. This is measured separately at distance and at near. Smaller numbers are better because they indicate a smaller angle of deviation. Change is defined as the baseline value minus the 3-year value, therefore positive change = improvement. If the 3-year PACT is an esodeviation, change in PACT from baseline is the reduction in the exodeviation plus the amount of the 3-year exodeviation.</description>

        <title>Mean Near PACT at 3 Years</title>
        <description>The prism and alternate cover test (PACT) is used to measure the angle of strabismus, or deviation, in prism diopters. This is measured separately at distance and at near. Smaller numbers are better because they indicate a smaller angle of deviation. Mean PACT was assessed in all patients who completed the 3-year visit. All 3-year visit data will be analyzed regardless of what treatment(s) a patient has received and regardless of whether the patient has undergone reoperation. PACT was analyzed as a continuous variable and compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANOVA) models that adjust for the corresponding baseline value (e.g. ANCOVA model of 3-year PACT at near will adjust for baseline PACT at near).</description>

        <population>Range of the mean was -14 to 40 for the BLR group and -6 to 30 for the RR group.</population>

          <title>Change in Near Stereoacuity From Baseline to 3 Years</title>
          <description>Stereoacuity scores (seconds of arc) were calculated based on the Randot Preschool stereoacuity test (scores: 800, 400, 200, 100, 60 and 40). Seconds of arc refers to the visual angle that is being measured in order to determine depth perception. Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity.
A logarithm base 10 transformation was used to convert stereoacuity scores to the log scale to calculate descriptive statistics (reported as seconds of arc, or arcsec).
Change is defined as the baseline value minus the 3-year value, therefore positive change = improvement.</description>

Child questionnaire - consists of 12 items which assess how the child feels about his/her eye condition.
One version for children aged 5 to &lt; 8 years has a 3-level response scale
The version for children aged 8 years and older has a 5-level response scale
Parent proxy questionnaire - consists of 12 items which assess how the parent feels the child's eye condition affects the child
Parental questionnaire - consists of 17 items which assess how the child's eye condition affects the parent. Has 3 sub-scales: surgical, functional, and psycho-social.
All scales ranged from 0 to 100; higher values indicated a better quality of life. Sub-scales were not combined, but rather were each evaluated individually on a scale of 0-100.</description>

        <title>Participants Suboptimal Surgical Outcome at 3 Years</title>
        <description>Suboptimal surgical outcome at the 3-year visit was defined as meeting any of the three suboptimal surgical outcome criteria at the 3-year visit (regardless of whether the criterion had been met at an earlier visit), or undergoing reoperation at any time.
The three criteria for suboptimal surgical outcome were:
Exotropia at distance OR near at any time during the exam (i.e., can be constant or intermittent; determined by a cover/uncover test) with a magnitude of ≥10Δ by SPCT, confirmed by a retest
Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by at least 3 cover/uncover tests—one must be before any dissociation) with a magnitude of ≥6Δ by SPCT, confirmed by a retest
Decrease in Randot Preschool near stereoacuity ≥2 octaves (≥0.6 log arcsec) from enrollment, or to nil, confirmed by a retest</description>
        <time_frame>3 years after enrollment</time_frame>
        <population>Includes only those who completed the 3 year visit.</population>
