  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence of the immune response to HAV (hepatitis A virus)
      antigens and HBs (hepatitis B surface) antigens in healthy adults previously vaccinated with
      Twinrix Adult in the primary study, HAB-032 (208127/022). The subjects will be invited for
      blood sampling 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years after the primary vaccination to evaluate the
      antibody persistence. For subjects in whom low circulating antibodies are detected, the
      presence of immune memory against hepatitis A &amp; B antigens will be investigated by the
      administration of a challenge dose of the appropriate vaccine (Havrix and/or Engerix-B) at
      the next planned visit.

      No new subjects will be recruited during this study.

As lot to lot consistency was assessed during the primary study, the 3 groups (lot A, B or C) were pooled into the Twinrix Group for data analyses during the first long-term follow-up NCT00289718 and this long-term follow-up.
A challenge dose of the Havrix or Engerix-B vaccines can be administered in this study based on serology results at each time point.</description>

          <description>Only 1 subject received a challenge dose at Year 16 of Engerix-B.
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject, or may evolve into one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the long-term total cohort which included subjects who returned at the blood sampling time point for whom results were available and who received a challenge dose of Engerix-B vaccine because their anti-HBs antibody concentrations were &lt; 10 mIU/mL.</population>
