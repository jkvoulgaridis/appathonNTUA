  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the time course of duloxetine efficacy on the
      symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)and on the symptoms of Soft Tissue Discomfort
      Syndrome(STDS) via use of 24-hour Actigraph™ measures.

      We hypothesize that there will be a reduction in both MDD and STDS symptoms in MDD patients
      with co-morbid STDS symptoms. We further hypothesize that there will be a rapid improvement
      in functional outcome ratings and 24-hour activity in MDD patients with co-morbid STDS
      symptoms which may occur even before the antidepressant effect is observed.
