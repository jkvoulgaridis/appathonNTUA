      The major aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a bundled, multi-level
      intervention (Sister to Sister) on smoking cessation outcomes in female smokers residing in
      public housing neighborhoods.

      Hypothesis 1.1: As compared to the control group, women receiving the Sister to Sister
      Intervention will have higher 7-day point prevalence quit rates at 6- and 12-months as
      validated by salivary cotinine.

      Hypothesis 1.2: As compared to the control group, women receiving the Sister to Sister
      Intervention will have higher 6- and 12-month prolonged smoking abstinence as validated by
      salivary cotinine.

      This was a cluster randomized controlled study evaluating the effect of a multi-level
      intervention, Sister to Sister, on the smoking cessation in two Southeastern US metropolitan
      areas. Fourteen subsidized housing neighborhoods, eight in Charleston, SC and six in Augusta,
      GA, were pair matched based on size; with one neighborhood in each pair randomized to the
      intervention to ensure balanced recruitment between groups. Neighborhoods ranged in size from
      22 to 33 participants with a total sample size of 409 women; neighborhoods were chosen as the
      primary sampling unit to prevent contamination of the outcome within neighborhoods, with
      women in the neighborhoods as secondary sampling unit. All statistical analyses were
      conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with statistical significance at an alpha
      level of 0.05. Comparison between groups at baseline used t-tests for continuous variables
      and chi-square tests for categorical variables. The primary outcome of interest was smoking
      status which was dichotomized (smoker/non-smoker) at the 6 and 12 month measurements. Smoking
      status was determined by cotinine levels in saliva with non-smokers defined as those with
      cotinine levels of 14 ng/mL or less.

    <description>Women in neighborhoods randomized to the S2S received 24-week bundled multi-level intervention. Individual-led strategies were led by paid community health workers (CHWs). The CHWs provided 1:1 contact to reinforce social support, and enhanced self-efficacy with cessation attempts.

The weekly group sessions were initiated during the 1st week of the intervention, with a total of 6 group sessions over a 6-week period. Transdermal nicotine patches were offered to participants who set a quit date. Within the 24-week study period, the neighborhood tenant association, in partnership with study staff, implemented at least two neighborhood level anti-smoking activities</description>

      <recruitment_details>Of the 34 subsidized housing neighborhoods in these two regions, the study was implemented in the 14 neighborhoods that met eligibility. Seven matched pairs were formed and randomly assigned one neighborhood in each pair to either the treatment condition or a delayed control condition. 27-32 participants enrolled in each neighborhood.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Common reasons for exclusions were not a resident of the neighborhood, not an active smokers.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>Women in neighborhoods randomized to the S2S received 24-week bundled multi-level intervention. Individual-led strategies were led by paid community health workers (CHWs). The CHWs provided 1:1 contact to reinforce social support, and enhanced self-efficacy with cessation attempts. A certified smoking cessation counselor led behavioral group sessions using the S2S handbook based on the PHS Guidelines. The weekly group sessions were initiated during the 1st week of the intervention, with a total of 6 group sessions over a 6-week period. Transdermal nicotine patches were offered to participants who set a quit date. Within the 24-week study period, the neighborhood tenant association, in partnership with study staff, implemented at least two neighborhood level anti-smoking activities
