  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal CPAP will improve cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) performance in patients with
      overlap syndrome(COPD and OSA). Nasal CPAP is proven to improve cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing in patients with OSA. The investigators hypothesis is that patients with overlap
      syndrome will have a greater improvement in their cardiopulmonary exercise testing besides a
      possible improvement in their lung function test and airway resistance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the Oklahoma City VA sleep clinic with obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome and a desire to initiate CPAP treatment will be included if they have overlap
      syndrome. Patients will undergo a spirometry and CPET before being started on CPAP as part of
      standard clinical care. The CPET will be repeated after 8-12 weeks of CPAP use. Patients will
      be excluded if they have any contraindication to mild exercise or they cannot perform an
      exercise test due to limited mobility.
