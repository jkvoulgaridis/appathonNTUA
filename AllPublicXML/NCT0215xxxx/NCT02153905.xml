  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for
      treating patients with cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient,
      growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells
      with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells
      back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are
      modifying the patients white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-MAGE-A3
      incorporated in the retrovirus.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see
      if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-MAGE A3 cells) cause tumors to shrink and to
      be certain the treatment is safe

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-66 with cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of
           Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans,
           x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed

        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti MAGE-A3 cells.
           {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the
           patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti MAGE-A3 cells and aldesleukin. They will
           stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,
      lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1
      year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.

      Background:

        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both alpha and beta chains
           of a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the human leukocyte antigen serotype within
           HLA-A &quot;A&quot; serotype group (HLA-A 01) restricted MAGE-A3 tumor antigen, which can be used
           to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency.

        -  In co-cultures with human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group
           (HLA-A 01) and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors, the anti-MAGE-A3- A 01 restricted
           (anti-MAGE-A3-01) TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferon
           (IFN)- &gt;= with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  Determine a safe dose of administration of autologous T cells transduced with an anti-
           MAGE-A3 HLA-A 01-restricted TCR (MAGE-A3-01) TCR and aldesleukin to patients following a
           nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.

        -  Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with
           metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A 01 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

        -  Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3 antigen

        -  Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one
           first line treatment for metastatic disease

      Patients may not have:

      - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis will be transduced
           with the retroviral vector supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3 HLA-A 01-restricted
           TCR.

        -  The study will begin with a phase I dose escalation. After the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD) cell dose has been determined, patients will be enrolled into the phase II portion
           of the trial at the MTD established during the phase I portion of the study. In the
           phase II portion, patients will be entered into two cohorts: cohort 2a will include
           patients with metastatic melanoma; cohort 2b will include patients with renal cancer and
           other types of metastatic cancer.

        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex
           vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus intravenous (IV) aldesleukin.

        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off
           study criteria are met.

        -  For each of the two strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion, the study will be conducted
           using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.
           For each of these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a
           clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the
           first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will
           continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.

        -  For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to
           be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a
           modes 20% partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).

        -  In order to complete the dose escalation phase and both phase II cohorts, a total of up
           to 20+82=102 patients may be required (20 + 2 strata with a maximum of 41 apiece). Up to
           6 patients enrolled at the MTD will count towards the accrual in the appropriate phase
           II strata if they are evaluable for response and if they would be fully eligible for
           enrollment in the phase II portion of the trial. Provided that about 4-5 patients per
           month will be able to be enrolled onto this trial, approximately 2 to 3 years may be
           needed to accrue the maximum number of required patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent cancer that expresses MAGE-A3
                  as assessed by one of the following methods: reverse transcription polymerase
                  chain reaction (RT-PCR) on tumor tissue defined as 30,000 copies of MAGE-A3 per
                  106 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) copies, or by
                  immunohistochemistry of resected tissue defined as 10% or greater of tumor cells
                  being 2-3+ for MAGE-A3, or serum antibody reactive with MAGE-A3. Metastatic
                  cancer diagnosis will be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology at the National
                  Cancer Institute (NCI).

               2. Patients must have previously received prior first line standard therapy (or
                  effective salvage chemotherapy regimens) for their disease, if known to be

                       immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment
                       and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

                  vitiligo). Patients must have progressing disease after prior treatment. Note:
                  Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented
                  gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity must have a normal colonoscopy with normal colonic
                  biopsies

              14. Subjects must be co-enrolled in protocol 03-C-0277.

        Note: Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented gastrointestinal

             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune

A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>
