  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how molecular profiling and targeted therapy work in
      treating patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body compared to
      standard treatment. Information about genetic differences in a patient's tumor can be used to
      choose treatment that may target the tumor. It is not yet validated whether selecting
      treatment after studying the genetic changes that are associated with cancer in a patient's
      tumor is a better way to treat patients with metastatic cancer compared to therapy not based
      on studying the genetic changes that are associated with cancer.

      I. To determine whether patients treated with a matched targeted therapy selected on the
      basis of genomic alteration analysis of the tumor have longer progression-free survival from
      the time of randomization than those whose treatment is not selected on the basis of
      alteration analysis.

      OUTLINE: After completion of molecular profiling, patients who qualify for the trial will be
      offered randomization as previously. If they wish to be randomized, patients will be
      randomized to one of the two arms: matched targeted therapy (ARM I) or other therapy (ARM
      II). Patients who decline to be randomized will then be offered their choice of the two trial
      arms.

      ARM I: Matched targeted therapy: Molecular profiling results are used to assign targeted
      therapy. Patients receive targeted therapy by participating in a Phase I or a Phase II
      clinical trial. If a clinical trial is not available, and a commercially available targeted
      therapy exists (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved for another indication), patients
      can receive the FDA-approved drug.

      ARM II: Other therapy: Patients receive standard of care therapy at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      Patients with tumor progression who achieve the primary study endpoint can cross over to the
      other treatment arm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic cancer

          -  Patients may have received unlimited lines of prior therapy

          -  Prior to randomization, patients with metastatic disease must have been treated with
             established standard-of-care therapy, or physicians have determined that such
             established therapy is not sufficiently efficacious, or patients have declined to
             receive standard-of-care therapy

          -  The patient has measurable disease

          -  The patient has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

          -  The patient has biopsy-accessible tumor; for patients who had no prior anticancer
             therapy and had surgical resection within a year and tumor tissue is immediately
             available, that tumor will be analyzed and no biopsy will be needed
