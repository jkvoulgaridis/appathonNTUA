  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the PRIORITI-MTF study is to help determine whether a new type of custom designed
      brace, called the IDEO ™ along with a physical therapy program, called Return to Run,
      improves physical function. This brace was developed for wounded warriors who wanted to
      return to an active lifestyle.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the benefits (and cost-benefits) of an
      integrated orthotic and rehabilitation program that incorporates the Intrepid Dynamic
      Exoskeletal Orthosis (IDEO) and the Return to Run (RTR) physical therapy regimen, but
      designed for scalability in the broader military environment (i.e. beyond San Antonio
      Military Medical Center where the program was developed)

    <description>The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a participant reported global health measure assessing the participant's overall perspective of their health status. Responses are summarized into 2 scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) (range 0-100) and a Mental Component Score (MCS) (range 0-100). The 12 items correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

This study used Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) modules for Overall dysfunction, mobility, daily activities, hand and arm function, and emotional status. Scores range is 0-100. Lower scores indicate better function. Scores are standardized; the formula for standardization is: ((Actual total raw score - lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range) *100</description>

        <description>The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a participant reported global health measure assessing the participant's overall perspective of their health status. Responses are summarized into 2 scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) (range 0-100) and a Mental Component Score (MCS) (range 0-100). The 12 items correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

This study used Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) modules for Overall dysfunction, mobility, daily activities, hand and arm function, and emotional status. Scores range is 0-100. Lower scores indicate better function. Scores are standardized; the formula for standardization is: ((Actual total raw score - lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range) *100.</description>

        <title>Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) - Physical Component Summary (PCS)</title>
        <description>The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a participant reported global health measure assessing the participant's overall perspective of their health status. Responses are summarized into 2 scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) (range 0-100) and a Mental Component Score (MCS) (range 0-100). The 12 items correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

          <title>Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) - Emotional Status</title>
          <description>The Short Musculoskeletal function Assessment (SMFA) is a participant reported assessment of the impact a musculoskeletal condition on individual function and daily activities. This study used Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) modules for Overall dysfunction, mobility, daily activities, hand and arm function, and emotional status. Scores range is 0-100. Lower scores indicate better function. Scores are standardized; the formula for standardization is: ((Actual total raw score - lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range) *100</description>

        <title>Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) - Physical Component Summary (PCS)</title>
        <description>The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a participant reported global health measure assessing the participant's overall perspective of their health status. Responses are summarized into 2 scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS). Scored on a 5 point Likert scale, the 12 items correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The United States population averages 50 points on both the PCS and MCS (scores may range from 0-100 on each). The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
