  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about asthma and how the environment affects asthma. Scientists know that air
      pollution (such as cigarette smoke and other particles in the air) can make asthma symptoms
      worse. This research is being done to study how the health of a person with asthma responds
      to an air cleaner. The investigator hypothesize that an air cleaner will improve the health
      of persons with asthma.

      The investigators seek to determine the effect of placing air cleaner devices in the homes of
      adults with asthma on the adults' asthma health. To this end, the investigators aim to study
      40 adults with asthma that are 18-50 years of age and live in Baltimore. Participants will
      receive either true air cleaners or sham cleaners in a blinded, randomized manner for one
      month, and then, after a washout period, participants will cross over and receive the other
      intervention (sham or true cleaner). All participants will have environmental monitoring
      (personal and in-home) to determine participants' particulate matter exposure, and be
      followed repeatedly during the 3 month study period for markers of asthma disease, including
      respiratory symptoms, medication and health care utilization, pulmonary function, systemic
      markers of inflammation, and bronchoscopic evidence of airway inflammation or epithelial cell
      dysfunction.

    <description>A High Efficiency Particulate Air Cleaner (HEPA) intervention will be placed in the participant's home for one month. During the last week of the month, health assessments will be conducted, which include in-home health questionnaires, symptom-, and activity- diaries/recalls, blood, and hand-held spirometry. Participants will also be asked to wear a light backpack with air monitoring devices during the course of the day during the last week in order to measure participants' exposures to pollutants. Finally, at the end of the month, participants will be asked to report to the Johns Hopkins outpatient endoscopy suite for bronchoscopy, during which airway sampling will occur under conscious sedation. For the participants who started in the experimental arm, after this one month intervention period, they will then enter a wash-out period where no intervention or outcome measures are undertaken for at least one month prior to cross-over to the sham comparator arm.</description>

            <description>A High Efficiency Particulate Air Cleaner (HEPA) intervention will be placed in the participant's home for one month. During the last week of the month, health assessments will be conducted, which include in-home health questionnaires, symptom-, and activity- diaries/recalls, blood, and hand-held spirometry. Participants will also be asked to wear a light backpack with air monitoring devices during the course of the day during the last week in order to measure participants' exposures to pollutants. Finally, at the end of the month, participants will be asked to report to the Johns Hopkins outpatient endoscopy suite for bronchoscopy, during which airway sampling will occur under conscious sedation. For the participants who started in the experimental arm, after this one month intervention period, they will then enter a wash-out period where no intervention or outcome measures are undertaken for at least one month prior to cross-over to the sham comparator arm.</description>

During the last week of the month, health assessments will be conducted, which include in-home health questionnaires, symptom-, and activity- diaries/recalls, blood, and hand-held spirometry. Participants will also be asked to wear a light backpack with air monitoring devices during the course of the day during the last week in order to measure their exposures to pollutants. Finally, at the end of the month, participants will be asked to report to the Johns Hopkins outpatient endoscopy suite for bronchoscopy, during which airway sampling will occur under conscious sedation.
