  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an
      intravenous infusion of serelaxin on top of standard of care therapy, in pediatric patients
      with acute heart failure (AHF)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was terminated early and the pediatric development of serelaxin in the treatment of
      acute heart failure (AHF) discontinued, following the results of the phase III study
      RELAX-AHF-2 (CRLX030A2301/NCT01870778) study in adult patients with AHF. Whilst no new safety
      concerns associated with serelaxin were observed, the study in adults did not meet either of
      its primary endpoints

    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) concentration was presented as the surrogate for PK parameters, the original primary endpoint, due to the unavailability of the PK parameters Css and CL.

The ELISA method used a monoclonal antibody specific for human H2 relaxin as the capture reagent and an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for human.</description>

In Cohort 1, patients in age group of 6 to &lt;18 years were enrolled either into a low-dose or a high-dose group. During this 48-hour treatment period, the serelaxin dose rates to be administered were 3 μg/kg/day, 10 μg/kg/day and 30 μg/kg/day in the low -dose group; 10 μg/kg/day, 30 μg/kg/day and 100 μg/kg/day in the high-dose group.

Serelaxin concentration was determined in serum by a validated Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) based upon the commercially available kit from R&amp;D Systems (Catalogue No. DRL200). The ELISA method used a monoclonal antibody specific for human H2 relaxin as the capture reagent and an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for human.</description>

Serelaxin concentration was determined in serum by a validated Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) based upon the commercially available kit from R&amp;D Systems (Catalogue No. DRL200). The ELISA method used a monoclonal antibody specific for human H2 relaxin as the capture reagent and an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for human.</description>

Both the low-dose and high- dose groups were planned to receive equal number of patients.</description>

            <description>Serelaxin was administered intravenously on top of standard therapy for acute heart failure, for a total of 48 hours. In Cohort 3, patients in age group of 1 month to &lt;1 year were enrolled either into a low-dose or a high-dose group. During this 48-hour treatment period, the serelaxin dose rates to be administered were 3 μg/kg/day, 10 μg/kg/day and 30 μg/kg/day in the low -dose group; 10 μg/kg/day, 30 μg/kg/day and 100 μg/kg/day in the high-dose group. In this cohort, high- dose group was planned to receive twice the number of patients in low-dose group.</description>

          <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) concentration was presented as the surrogate for PK parameters, the original primary endpoint, due to the unavailability of the PK parameters Css and CL. Serelaxin concentration was determined in serum by a validated Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) based upon the commercially available kit from R&amp;D Systems (Catalogue No. DRL200). The ELISA method used a monoclonal antibody specific for human H2 relaxin as the capture reagent and an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for human.</description>

            <description>Serelaxin was administered intravenously on top of standard therapy for acute heart failure, for a total of 48 hours. In Cohort 3, patients in age group of 1 month to &lt;1 year were enrolled either into a low-dose or a high-dose group. During this 48-hour treatment period, the serelaxin dose rates to be administered were 3 μg/kg/day, 10 μg/kg/day and 30 μg/kg/day in the low -dose group; 10 μg/kg/day, 30 μg/kg/day and 100 μg/kg/day in the high-dose group. In this cohort, high- dose group was planned to receive twice the number of patients in low-dose group.</description>

        <title>Baseline and Change From Baseline in Mean Central Venous Pressure and Arterial Oxygen Saturation for Low Dose (3-10-30 ug/kg/Day)</title>
        <description>This analysis includes central venous and arterial oxygen saturation measurement, yielding a calculation of the arterio-venous oxygen extraction, where available at each time point. If no arterial access was available, then arterial oxygen saturation measurement data were obtained using a pulse oximeter. The evaluations, as available, were done at baseline, prior to each dose escalation and at approximately 24 hours after the end of the infusion. Hemodynamic effects were also assessed for safety at additional time points during the study. Absolute values are presented at baseline; change from baseline values are presented at post-baseline time points</description>

          <description>Serelaxin was administered intravenously on top of standard therapy for acute heart failure, for a total of 48 hours. In Cohort 1, patients in age group of 6 to &lt;18 years were enrolled either into a low-dose or a high-dose group. During this 48-hour treatment period, the serelaxin dose rates to be administered were 3 μg/kg/day, 10 μg/kg/day and 30 μg/kg/day in the low -dose group; 10 μg/kg/day, 30 μg/kg/day and 100 μg/kg/day in the high-dose group. Both the low-dose and high- dose groups were planned to receive equal number of patients.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to the early termination of the study, the planned analyses were not performed as the limited set of data would preclude meaningful interpretation.</limitations_and_caveats>
