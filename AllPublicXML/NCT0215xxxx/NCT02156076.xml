  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BMS-919373 on atrial fibrillation (AF)
      through its effect on AF burden (AFB), or the percent of time in AF, in subjects with
      paroxysmal AF (pAF) when administered orally at a range of doses (2 mg once daily (QD), 5 mg
      QD, 12 mg QD following a 1-week period of loading doses of 3 mg QD, 8 mg QD and 20 mg QD,
      respectively) for a total of 4 weeks. It is hypothesized that treatment with BMS-919373 will
      reduce AF burden as compared to baseline relative to placebo.

      Primary Purpose: Protocol designed to assess, by the use of long term non-invasive
      beat-to-beat monitoring with the SEEQ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) system, the effect of
      BMS-919373 on the percent change from baseline relative to placebo of atrial fibrillation
      burden in subjects with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Atrial Fibrillation Burden (AFB) as Assessed by SEEQ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) System</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>AFB is defined as the percent of time spent in atrial fibrillation (AF). AFB will be assessed by use of long term non- invasive beat-to-beat monitoring with the SEEQ MCT system. This technology consists of a low-profile adhesive patch that has been approved for continuous use for up to 30 days. The patch is able to continuously record electrocardiographic signals and, in conjunction with a wirelessly connected portable cellular communications device, transmit these signals for real-time analysis, including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and AFB.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment-related AEs and Death</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Trough Observed Concentration (Cmin) of BMS-919373</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 (predose), Day 22 (predose, 1, 2, and 4 hours postdose), and Day 29 (24 hours after last dose of Day 28)</time_frame>

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug is uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Vc/F is a hypothetical volume into which a drug initially distributes upon administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence (TTFR) (Symptomatic or Asymptomatic)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The TTFR is defined as the time to the first MCT-recorded AF episode after the first loading dose on Day 1. MCT will provide both &quot;System-triggered&quot; and &quot;Patient-triggered&quot; results and report them separately. &quot;System-triggered&quot; results will include both symptomatic and asymptomatic findings, while &quot;Patient-triggered&quot; results will be the symptomatic ones triggered to report by patients. The analysis will be done both for &quot;System-triggered&quot; and for &quot;Patient-triggered&quot; results.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Atrial Fibrillation Burden (AFB) as Assessed by SEEQ Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) System</title>
        <description>AFB is defined as the percent of time spent in atrial fibrillation (AF). AFB will be assessed by use of long term non- invasive beat-to-beat monitoring with the SEEQ MCT system. This technology consists of a low-profile adhesive patch that has been approved for continuous use for up to 30 days. The patch is able to continuously record electrocardiographic signals and, in conjunction with a wirelessly connected portable cellular communications device, transmit these signals for real-time analysis, including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and AFB.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment-related AEs and Death</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

          <title>Time to First Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence (TTFR) (Symptomatic or Asymptomatic)</title>
          <description>The TTFR is defined as the time to the first MCT-recorded AF episode after the first loading dose on Day 1. MCT will provide both &quot;System-triggered&quot; and &quot;Patient-triggered&quot; results and report them separately. &quot;System-triggered&quot; results will include both symptomatic and asymptomatic findings, while &quot;Patient-triggered&quot; results will be the symptomatic ones triggered to report by patients. The analysis will be done both for &quot;System-triggered&quot; and for &quot;Patient-triggered&quot; results.</description>
