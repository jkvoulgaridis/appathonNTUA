  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology
      using the Real Imager 8 (RI8) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D
      metabolic maps of the breast and based on sophisticated machine learning technology, provides
      objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor in the breast. The procedure is
      non-invasive, comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. It is based on acquiring
      infrared images of the breast. Those images are processed and analyzed by computers to
      provide the objective risk assessment.

      The technology is intended to be used as a screening tool for breast cancer and emerges as
      highly useful in women for whom screening mammography is sub-optimal, such as women with
      dense breast. 3D MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating
      patients with mammographically dense breasts.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the ability of this novel technology to
      detect breast cancer in women.
