  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively and systematically review records of
      overweight and obese Medifast Weight Control Center (MWCC) members who have been assigned to
      the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Plan or the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Plan for weight loss to gain a better understanding of
      the effectiveness of these programs. The study will describe demographics of this population,
      along with weight loss, anthropometrics, body composition and effects on available
      cardiovascular parameters. Adherence to the plans will also be examined.

      The study hypothesis is that the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Meal Replacement Plan and the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Meal
      Replacement Plan are both effective programs for weight loss in overweight and obese adults.

    <description>The primary endpoint in this study is weight and the primary outcome is change from baseline body weight at 12 weeks for each plan (5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 and 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Plans). Change from baseline will also be examined at other predetermined time points (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20 and 24 weeks, and final weight loss visit - the mean length of time from baseline to the final weight loss visit was 18.06 weeks for the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Plan and 17.35 weeks for the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Plan.).</description>

        This study is a systematic retrospective chart review of existing MWCC charts located in
        Maryland, Texas, Florida or Pennsylvania for MWCC members who used either the Medifast 5 &amp;
        2 &amp; 2 Plan or the Medifast 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 Plan for weight loss.

        Charts will be reviewed for members that started either the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Plan or the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1
        Plan on or after January 1, 2012. This start date was chosen because it represents the date
        when Medifast began using the current versions of the 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 Plan and the 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1
        Plan. Only charts of those members who are no longer in the active weight loss phase of
        their program at the MWCC will be considered for the study.
