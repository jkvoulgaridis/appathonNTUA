      A phase 2 open label trial to test a potential drug treatment for Rett syndrome, the leading
      known genetic cause of severe neurological impairment in girls. The drug, Copaxone (generic
      name - Glatiramer acetate) is medication FDA approved for the treatment of multiple
      sclerosis. Copaxone's high safety profile has been documented in large cohorts of patients
      for more than 12 years.

      Background/rationale for the study:

      In Rett syndrome brain cells aren't actually lost, instead poor maturation of connections
      between brain cells (synapses) prevents effective neurological functioning, and is the main
      morphological feature of the disease. The MeCP2 gene plays a major role in transcriptional
      regulation of other genes, one of which is the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF).

      The disease progression and severity of symptoms is directly affected by the level of BDNF
      expression. An increase of BDNF levels (by genetic manipulations or pharmacological agents)
      leads to delayed onset of Rett syndrome-like symptoms in experimental models; rescued
      gait/mobility, improved quality of life and increased survival rates.

      Copaxone treatment by subcutaneous injection caused elevation of BDNF levels. Quantitative
      immunofluorescence assays showed about a twofold increase in neuronal expression of BDNF
      following Copaxone treatment.

      We expect that an increase in BDNF levels with Copaxone administration will stimulate
      communication between brain cells (synaptic maturation), which will lead to amelioration of
      symptoms (motor functions/gait, cognitive functions, breathing, encephalopathy and improve
      quality of life) for girls with Rett syndrome.

    <measure>Gait Velocity as Measured by GAITRite System</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Final week of treatment (week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>To perform quantitative gait assessments a computerized walkway (457 × 90.2 × 0.64cm) with embedded pressure sensors (GAIT Rite system) was used. Subjects walked on the walkway for two trials, while wearing comfortable footwear.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breath Hold Index (Number of Breath Holds Per Hour; Assessed in the Sleep Monitoring Lab)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and during final week of treatment (week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>Breath hold index is defined as number of breath holds/hour. Respirations were monitored with sleep monitoring equipment during the daytime at the polysomnography laboratory with additional oronasal airflow, electromyography (EMG), EEG and video monitoring to confirm wakefulness during the period of study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breath Hold Time (Assessed in the Sleep Monitoring Lab)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Final week of treatment (week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>Breath Hold Time is defined as percentage of time spent holding the breath in a specific time unit. It is measured by a standard medical technique where belts are placed on the chest and abdomen to record movement and sensors are used to record nasal flow. Wake respiration was monitored with sleep monitoring equipment during the daytime at the polysomnography laboratory with additional oronasal airflow, EMG, EEG and video monitoring to confirm wakefulness during the period of study.</description>

    <measure>Visual Memory Novelty Score as Assessed by TX300 Tobii Computer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Final week of treatment (week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>Eye-tracking is considered an indication of visual memory. Eye-tracking data was recorded at 300 Hz sampling rate using a Tobii T300 computer (Tobii Technology, Danderyd, Sweden). The actual data given by the computer represents the percentage of time spent looking at a novel visual target - this is called the novelty score. Visual memory, as indexed by the novelty score, is the percentage of time spent looking at a novel target during the test (&quot;visual paired comparison paradigm&quot;). Duration of testing was 2 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Visual Attention (Number of Fixations) Assessed by Eye-tracking TX300 Tobii Computer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Final week of treatment (week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual attention is indexed by duration and number of fixations on novel target on testing. The standard method of assessing visual attention in neuropsychology is by measuring:
A)number of fixations (how many times the subject looks at each of the 2 visual targets). The higher number of fixations, the more attentive the subject to that visual target.
B) duration of fixations in seconds (the longer the fixation the more attentive). Duration of fixations correlates with intelligence: the smarter the person is the shorter his fixations are.
Eye-tracking data was recorded at 300 Hz sampling rate using a Tobii T300 (Tobii Technology AB, Danderyd, Sweden). The measured index is called the Novelty Score which indicates the percentage of time spent looking at novel visual target. Duration of testing session was 2 minutes.</description>

        <title>Visual Memory Novelty Score as Assessed by TX300 Tobii Computer.</title>
        <description>Eye-tracking is considered an indication of visual memory. Eye-tracking data was recorded at 300 Hz sampling rate using a Tobii T300 computer (Tobii Technology, Danderyd, Sweden). The actual data given by the computer represents the percentage of time spent looking at a novel visual target - this is called the novelty score. Visual memory, as indexed by the novelty score, is the percentage of time spent looking at a novel target during the test (&quot;visual paired comparison paradigm&quot;). Duration of testing was 2 minutes.</description>

        <title>Visual Attention (Number of Fixations) Assessed by Eye-tracking TX300 Tobii Computer.</title>
        <description>Visual attention is indexed by duration and number of fixations on novel target on testing. The standard method of assessing visual attention in neuropsychology is by measuring:
A)number of fixations (how many times the subject looks at each of the 2 visual targets). The higher number of fixations, the more attentive the subject to that visual target.
B) duration of fixations in seconds (the longer the fixation the more attentive). Duration of fixations correlates with intelligence: the smarter the person is the shorter his fixations are.
Eye-tracking data was recorded at 300 Hz sampling rate using a Tobii T300 (Tobii Technology AB, Danderyd, Sweden). The measured index is called the Novelty Score which indicates the percentage of time spent looking at novel visual target. Duration of testing session was 2 minutes.</description>
