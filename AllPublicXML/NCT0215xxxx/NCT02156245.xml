  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a rehabilitation protocol based on
      individualized combined eccentric and concentric cycle ergometer training compared to
      classical concentric cycle training among patients with either coronary artery disease (CAD)
      or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will therefore evaluate the
      efficacy of combined eccentric/concentric training on physical capacity and overall autonomy,
      and will analyse the adaptive mechanisms with regard to both adaptation to cardiac and
      muscular effort and tolerance.

      The research will take place in 3 phases:

      PHASE 1 :

      30 healthy volunteers will be included to test tolerance to personalized exercise on an
      eccentric cycle ergometer.

      PHASE 2 :

      15 patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) and 15 patients suffering from
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be included to test the same protocol.

      PHASE 3 :

      A total of 169 patients split into 2 parallel groups will be included: a group receiving
      conventional rehabilitation (group A) and the other group receiving eccentric exercise
      combined to conventional rehabilitation (group B).

      Coronary patients: 93 patients will be included (62 patients in group A and 31 in group B).

      COPD patients: 76 patients will be included (38 patients per group).
