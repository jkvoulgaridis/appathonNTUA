    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded format and will evaluate
      the ability of a local anesthetic, Ropivacaine, to decrease pain after gastric bypass
      surgery. The drug will be administered into the abdomen during a bariatric bypass surgery.
      After surgery, patients who received Ropivacaine will be compared to those without
      Ropivacaine to determine its effect on reducing pain, recovery of lung function, ability to
      walk, and quality of life during recovery.

      Introduction: Postoperative pain control remains a major challenge for surgical procedures,
      including laparoscopic gastric bypass. Pain management is particularly relevant in obese
      patients who experience a higher number of of cardiovascular and pulmonary events. effective
      pain management may reduce their risk of serious postoperative complications, such as deep
      venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic, ropivacaine, to reduce postoperative pain in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

      Methods and Analysis: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare
      intraperitoneal ropivacaine (Intervention) versus normal saline (placebo) in 120 adult
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Ropivacaine will be infused over the oesophageal
      hiatus and throughout the abdomen. Patients in the control arm will undergo the same
      treatment as normal saline. The primary end point will be postoperative pain at 1, 2 and 4
      hours postoperatively. Pain measurements will then occur every 4 hours for 24 h and every 8h
      until discharge. Secondary endpoints will include opioid use, peak expiratory flow, 6 min
      walk distance and quality of life. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used and repeated
      measures will be analysed using mixed model approach. post-hoc pairwise comparison of the
      treatment groups at different time points will be carried out using multiple comparisons with
      adjustments to the type 1 error. Results of the study will inform the feasibility of
      effectiveness of intraperitoneal ropivacaine.

      Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network
      Research Ethics Board and Health Canada in April 2014. The findings of the study will be
      disseminated through national and international conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

Under direct visualization, 50mL (Milliliter) (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL (Milliliter) of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual.</description>

Using a standard suction/irrigation device and tubing, 200mg of Ropivacaine (0.2% Ropivacaine in 100mL Normal Saline) will be instilled into the abdomen at the start of the case, prior to dissection as follows. Under direct visualization, 50mL (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual.

Using a standard suction/irrigation device and tubing, 200mg of Ropivacaine (0.2% Ropivacaine in 100mL Normal Saline) will be instilled into the abdomen at the start of the case, prior to dissection as follows. Under direct visualization, 50mL (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual.

Using a standard suction/irrigation device and tubing, 200mg of Ropivacaine (0.2% Ropivacaine in 100mL Normal Saline) will be instilled into the abdomen at the start of the case, prior to dissection as follows. Under direct visualization, 50mL (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual.

Emotional_State:9 questions subscore can range between 9-45 Physical_Comfort:12 questions, subscore range between 12-60 Psychological Support:7 questions, subscore range between 7-35 Physical_Independence:5 questions, subscore range between 5-25 Pain:7 questions,subscore range between 5-25
Questionnaire has two parts A and B, In part A, a score of 1 represents the answer of &quot;None of the time (Poor)&quot;and 5 represents the answer&quot;All of the time (Excellent)&quot;Part B, score of 1 represents the answer&quot;All of the time (Excellent)&quot; and 5 represents&quot;None of the time (Poor)</description>

        <population>Overall Number of Participants Analyzed is not consistent with numbers provided Participant Flow module due to patients refusing, Early Discharge or being unable to provide the reading for outcome during the allocated time frame which could vary the number of results obtained in a specific time frame.</population>

            <description>The abdomen will be entered and trocars placed in the usual manner. Using a standard suction/irrigation device and tubing, 200mg of Ropivacaine (0.2% Ropivacaine in 100mL Normal Saline) will be instilled into the abdomen at the start of the case, prior to dissection as follows. Under direct visualization, 50mL (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual.
