    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a validated assessment tool using 0 through 10 scales (0 indicating &quot;no problem&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;worst problem&quot; on continuous VAS), to answer 6 questions (clinical domains) pertaining to 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. Computed composite scores of 4 or greater indicate suboptimal disease control. BASDAI questions includes:
Fatigue
Spinal pain
Joint pain / swelling
Areas of localized tenderness (called enthesitis, or inflammation of tendons and ligaments)
Morning stiffness duration
Morning stiffness severity. Each symptom has equal weighting, the mean of two scores related to morning stiffness was taken (questions 5 and 6). The resulting 0 to 10 score was added to the scores from questions 1-4. The resulting 0 to 50 score was divided by 5 to give a final 0-10 BASDAI score. BASDAI was a quick and simple index taking between 30 seconds and 2 minutes for completion.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical Function Component Summary (PCS) of the Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short-form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight subscales that were scored individually: physical functioning, role- physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0-100. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability. The overall summary scores, SF-36 physical Component Summary (PCS) was used to assess improvement from baseline in the Health-Related Quality Of Life of subjects. The change in SF-36 scores were evaluated using MMRM.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQoL) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ASQoL is a self-administered 18 item questionnaire that assesses disease-specific quality of life (QoL), consisting of statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a subject with ankylosing spondylitis: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered as a 'Yes' (scored as 1) or 'No' (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score ranges from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL). The change in ASQoL scores was evaluated using a mixed effect repeated measures model (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at 16 Weeks</title>
        <description>BASDAI is a validated assessment tool using 0 through 10 scales (0 indicating &quot;no problem&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;worst problem&quot; on continuous VAS), to answer 6 questions (clinical domains) pertaining to 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. Computed composite scores of 4 or greater indicate suboptimal disease control. BASDAI questions includes:
Fatigue
Spinal pain
Joint pain / swelling
Areas of localized tenderness (called enthesitis, or inflammation of tendons and ligaments)
Morning stiffness duration
Morning stiffness severity. Each symptom has equal weighting, the mean of two scores related to morning stiffness was taken (questions 5 and 6). The resulting 0 to 10 score was added to the scores from questions 1-4. The resulting 0 to 50 score was divided by 5 to give a final 0-10 BASDAI score. BASDAI was a quick and simple index taking between 30 seconds and 2 minutes for completion.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight subscales that were scored individually: physical functioning, role- physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0-100. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability. The overall summary scores, SF-36 physical Component Summary (PCS) was used to assess improvement from baseline in the Health-Related Quality Of Life of subjects. The change in SF-36 scores were evaluated using MMRM.</description>

        <description>ASQoL is a self-administered 18 item questionnaire that assesses disease-specific quality of life (QoL), consisting of statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a subject with ankylosing spondylitis: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered as a 'Yes' (scored as 1) or 'No' (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score ranges from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL). The change in ASQoL scores was evaluated using a mixed effect repeated measures model (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Responded for ASAS 20 at Week 4</title>
        <description>ASAS 20 response is a validated composite assessment, defined as an improvement of at least 20% and 1 unit on a scale of 10 in three main domains and no worsening of at least 20% and 1 unit on a scale of 10 in the fourth domain within a defined time frame. Four main ASAS domains include:
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm VAS ranging from not severe to very severe
Patient's assessment of back pain, measured on a 100 mm VAS ranging from no pain to unbearable pain
Function represented by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) average of 10 questions regarding ability to perform specific tasks as measured by a 0-10 VAS scale
Inflammation represented by average of duration and severity of morning stiffness for last 2 questions on BASDAI scale (0 - no problem, 10 - worst problem).</description>
