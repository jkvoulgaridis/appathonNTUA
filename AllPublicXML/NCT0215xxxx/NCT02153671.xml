  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess whether a live attenuated Influenza vaccine (LAIV) can
      induce a long-lasting immune memory by comparing the immunologic response to two doses of the
      OrniFlu® inactivated vaccine given to subjects previously primed with LAIV and subjects who
      did not received LAIV.

    <textblock>
      This study evaluated immunogenicity of an adjuvanted A(H5N1) inactivated influenza vaccine
      (IIV) in healthy adult subjects who received A(H5N2) live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)
      1.5 years earlier (September/October 2012) and compared this with a group of naive subjects
      that did not participate in the previous study. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the
      additional group of naive volunteers mirrored those utilized in the initial study.

    <description>The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells. A four-fold or greater antibody rise in titer was considered to be a seroconversion.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Titer of Serum Hemagglutination Inhibition Antibody Response to A/17/Duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) LAIV Strain Following Administration of A(H5N1) Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV)</title>
        <description>The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells. A four-fold or greater antibody rise in titer was considered to be a seroconversion.</description>

        <description>The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional WHO-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells. A four-fold or greater antibody rise in titer was considered to be a seroconversion.</description>

        <description>A four-fold or greater antibody rise in titer was considered to be a seroconversion. The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional WHO-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells.</description>

        <description>A four-fold or greater antibody rise in titer was considered to be a seroconversion. The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional WHO-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells.</description>

        <description>Seroprotection was defined as ≥1:40 antibody titer. The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional WHO-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells.</description>

The following H5 antigens were tested to evaluate the breadth of the response: i) A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)); ii) A/turkey/Turkey/5/05(H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (NIBRG-23 (H5N1)); iii) A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1)); and iv) A/17/duck/Potsdam/86/92 (H5N2) (d/Pot (H5N2)). HAI tests were performed on serum samples with the conventional WHO-recommended assays. Sera were pretreated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken, Japan) and tested against 4 HA units of several H5 antigens using horse red blood cells.</description>

          <description>Serum specimens were tested for neutralizing antibodies against A/17/turkey/Turkey/05/133 (H5N2) (17/t/Tur (H5N2)) LAIV strain and A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) PR8-based candidate vaccine virus (Indo (H5N1) by MN using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells. Titers of neutralizing antibodies were expressed as reciprocal of the greatest dilution giving a neutralization of 50% on the cytopathic effects of the virus in the tissue culture (TCID50). Seroprotection was defined as ≥1:40 antibody titer.</description>

        <description>Detection of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was carried out by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 16 HA units of sucrose-purified virus antigen was used to coat ELISA plates in a volume of 100 ml. Two-fold dilutions of sera were prepared starting from 1:10 (for IgA antibody) and 1:100 (for IgG antibody) and added to the coated wells, followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgA or IgG.</description>

        <description>A four-fold or greater antibody rise in titer was considered to be a seroconversion. Detection of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was carried out by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 16 HA units of sucrose-purified virus antigen was used to coat ELISA plates in a volume of 100 ml. Two-fold dilutions of sera were prepared starting from 1:10 (for IgA antibody) and 1:100 (for IgG antibody) and added to the coated wells, followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgA or IgG.</description>
