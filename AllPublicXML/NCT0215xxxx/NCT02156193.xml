  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although endoscopic colonic polypectomy has been an established procedure for two decades,
      the risk of bleeding is still higher after resecting of pedunculated polyps, because of the
      presence of a large artery in the stalk. Preventive methods such as endoloop and epinephrine
      injection have been proposed in the management of postpolypectomy bleeding in large colonic
      polyps. For prophylactic clip, there was no randomized controlled study assessing the
      efficacy in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large pedunculated polyps. So
      the investigators designed a randomized controlled trial to confirm the efficacy of
      application of prophylactic clip in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding in large
      polyps.

    <textblock>
      Patients who had pedunculated colorectal polyps with heads larger than 10 mm and stalks
      larger than 5 mm in diameter were included. In clip group, hemoclips were applied to the base
      of the stalk, followed by conventional snare polypectomy. In conventional group, conventional
      snare polypectomy was done without any preventive management. Immediate and delayed bleeding
      complications were assessed.
