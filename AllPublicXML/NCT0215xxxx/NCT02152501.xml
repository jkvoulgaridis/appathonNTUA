  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to research the effects of exercise on calories eaten and
      expended. The investigator expects to find out whether subjects change their eating and
      activity behaviors when starting an exercise program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Energy Balance as assessed by changes in adipose tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Whether participants were able to maintain a negative energy balance will be assessed by pre-post changes in stored adipose tissue, as assessed by a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (DEXA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>RRV of food will be assessed by evaluating the number of responses (mouse button presses) a participant is willing to complete to gain access to food or an alternative sedentary activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average daily calories consumed as assessed by dietary recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>On two weekdays and one weekend day, participants will fill out the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall (ASA24) to estimate dietary intake (total energy, grams carbohydrates, fat, protein, alcohol).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-post intervention changes in Ghrelin plasma levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide a fasting blood sample collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated and serum tubes. Changes in acylated Ghrelin will be measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>

    <measure>Pre-post intervention changes in Ghrelin concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide a fasting blood sample collected in EDTA-coated and serum tubes. Changes in Ghrelin concentrations will be measured via ELISA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-post intervention changes in irisin concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide a fasting blood sample collected in EDTA-coated and serum tubes. Changes in irisin concentrations will be measured via ELISA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-post intervention changes in myostatin plasma levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide a fasting blood sample collected in EDTA-coated and serum tubes. Changes in myostatin levels will be measured via ELISA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in relative reinforcing value (RRV) of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>RRV of physical activity will be assessed by evaluating the number of responses (mouse button presses) a subject is willing to complete to gain access to physical activity or a sedentary alternative.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in minutes of sedentary behavior, as assessed by activity tracker</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (week 0) and End Training (weeks 10-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Minutes of sedentary behavior (non-exercise activity) will be assessed by having participants wear an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days (minimum 10 hours per day) on the right hip.</description>
