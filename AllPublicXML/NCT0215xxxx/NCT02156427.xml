    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of autologous epidermal cells suspension
      grafting using a newly developed device named VITICELL® compared to placebo.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate safety of VITICELL® and global satisfaction of patient
      and investigator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged over 18 years old with a diagnosis of non-scaring leukoderma that
             has been stable over the last 2 years (non-segmental, segmental vitiligo and
             piebaldism)

          -  For non-segmental vitiligo: symmetrical vitiligo lesions, or parts of a lesion. A part
             of at least 1 cm2 (1 x 1 cm), but preferable 4 cm2 (2x2 cm) and preferably in the
             center of each lesions (left/right) should be treated.

        The minimum distance between the normal pigmented skin and the test area should preferably
        be at least 0.5 cm.

          -  For segmental vitiligo lesion and piebaldism: all lesions possible if two parts of at
             least 1 cm2 (1 x 1 cm), but preferably 4 cm2 (2 x 2 cm) in the lesion can be treated.
             The minimum distance between the 2 areas should be 2 cm and between test areas and to
             the normal pigmented skin preferably at least 0.5 cm.

          -  Medical treatments of vitiligo failed (in case of vitiligo: at least cream treatment
             for 6 months).

          -  Absence of infected lesion

          -  Negative serology (HIV-hepatitis B and C- Syphilis)

          -  Patient with a history of melanoma

          -  Positive serology (ongoing serious systemic disease, herpes, HIV, hepatitis B and
             C-Syphilis)

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  History of keloidal scars and presence of Koebner's phenomenon (type 1 and type 2b)

          -  Infected lesion

          -  Test areas not on fingers and toes vitiligo areas in case of non-segmental vitiligo

          -  Test areas not on facial non segmental vitiligo

          -  Pregnant women, or lactating

          -  Age &lt;18years
