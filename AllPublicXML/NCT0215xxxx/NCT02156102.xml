      Background:

      - People with sickle cell disease and other blood disorders sometimes get chronic leg ulcers.
      These are wounds that develop on the skin and don t go away. Current treatments do not work
      very well, so researchers want to learn more about why the ulcers happen. They want to find
      out which bacteria may cause it, and if external factors play a role.

      Objective:

      - To study social and environmental factors of sickle cell disease and the causes of sickle
      cell disease leg ulcers.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 18 and older who have sickle cell disease or another red cell disorder, with or
      without an active leg ulcer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a medical history and clinical evaluation. They will also have
           blood drawn.

        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their life, health, environment, stress,
           and other topics.

        -  Participants may provide a small sample of hair.

        -  Participants will be asked to collect a small amount of saliva.

        -  Participants with leg ulcers will have their skin microbiome sampled. The microbiome is
           all of the microbes (bacteria and and/or fungi) and their genes in and on the body.
           Researchers will use swabs to collect skin samples. Photographs will be taken of the
           skin sample area.

        -  Some participants without leg ulcers also will have their skin microbiome sampled.

        -  Some participants who have their skin microbiome sampled will return for a second visit.
           At this visit, their microbiome will be resampled. It will take place more than 30 days
           after the first visit.

    <textblock>
      Leg ulcers are a serious and debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). This
      study will explore microbial, genomic, and environmental (social and physical) factors, that
      may influence the onset and progression of leg ulcer formation and delayed healing in
      individuals living with SCD. There is variation in the incidence and duration of SCD leg
      ulcers. They are often very painful, resistant to treatment, and recurrent in nature. The
      etiology of SCD-associated leg ulcers is unclear, and we hypothesize that predisposition to
      developing leg ulcers is multifactorial. This multi site study is an exploratory study of the
      microbiome and environment of individuals living with sickle cell disease leg ulcers. The
      study s objective is to identify triggers that may be integral in leg ulcer onset and
      progression. The central goal of this study is to obtain an improved understanding of the
      participants clinical phenotype, leg ulcer mircobiome and the psychosocial and environmental
      factors that may impact this complication.

      To achieve these goals, we will: (1)characterize the leg skin microbiome of SCD participants
      living with and without leg ulcers within the United States and Sierra Leone; (2) collect and
      analyze psychosocial and physical environmental data of individuals with SCD without leg
      ulcers and with leg ulcers; (3) examine the psychosocial impact of leg ulcers on individuals
      with SCD by conducting a qualitative phase to explore the individual experiences to
      understand the physical function, stigma, and self-esteem associated with those with active,
      recurrent, or single-occurrence presentations of leg ulcers; and (4) explore what factors
      influence psychological resilience, to examine the relationship of psychological resilience
      to the health outcomes of an adult population living with sickle cell disease in the U.S. and
      in Sierra Leone. This will provide us the opportunity to understand the complexity of
      participants health, health care experiences and quality of life

        This is a descriptive study of individuals living with sickle cell diseases (SCD) with and
        without leg ulcers (accrual goal 550 participants). Leg ulcers are not observed in all
        individuals with SCD and we are interested in understanding why certain individuals develop
        leg ulcers. We will seek to include agematched patients without leg ulcers for the
        microbiome phase of the study. We will recruit and sample male or female adult participants
        with ulcers, currently without leg ulcers, and those with no previous history of leg
        ulcers. To ensure we recruit an adequate number of participants with and without leg
        ulcers, we will rely on multiple recruiting methods, which will include posting flyers,
        social media advertisements, and/or referrals.
