  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of continuous
      6-hour IV infusions of CXL-1427 in hospitalized patients with systolic heart failure which
      will first evaluate up to four ascending dose levels of CXL-1427 in up to four cohorts of 8
      patients each (the &quot;Dose Escalation&quot; cohorts). Subsequently, up to three of the initial dose
      levels of CXL-1427 may be assessed in the additional &quot;Expansion&quot; cohorts of up to
      approximately 16 patients to gain further confidence in the results at these dose levels. The
      CXL-1427 dose that will be evaluated in the first cohort will be 3µg/kg/min. The dose levels
      for the next three sequential Dose Escalation cohorts will be dependent on clinical safety
      and tolerability, as well as the results of the invasive hemodynamic measurements.

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE with onset after the start of the study drug infusion at Hour 00:00 through 30 days after the stop of the study drug infusion. All TEAEs and pertinent subsets of TEAEs (e.g., TEAEs with onset during the infusion of study drug, serious TEAEs, etc.) were summarized by system organ class (SOC), preferred term (PT) and treatment group</description>

    <description>Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD) was measured by an indwelling PA catheter.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Hour 2, Hour 4, Hour 6, Hour 8 post infusion initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac index is a measure of cardiac function, relating the cardiac output from the left ventricle in one minute to body surface area. It is calculated using the Fick principle, using oxygen consumption measured with a metabolic cart, hemoglobin levels, and the difference between arterial and superior vena cava oxygen saturation measured by co-oximetry. Cardiac index as calculated by the Fick method was performed using an assumed oxygen consumption value of 125 ml/min per m2 of body surface area. i.e., an assumed Fick method.</description>

             hemodynamic effects of the study drug. If the pulmonary artery catheter is to be
             placed for the sole purpose of monitoring the hemodynamic effect of the study drug,
             the patient must have a cardiac index (CI) ≤ 2.2L/min•m2 as measured by a non-invasive
             cardiac output monitor (NICaS device) ≤6 hours prior to placement of the catheter. In
             this setting, Exclusion Criteria 3 below also applies.]

          -  Have a Fick and/or thermodilution determination of cardiac index ≤2.5L/min•m2 at
             screening, i.e., ≤4 hours before the intended start of the study drug infusion; [Note:
             For determinations of CI using the thermodilution method, a mean of three consecutive
             values measured approximately 5 minutes apart, none of which differs from the mean
             value by more than 15%, should be used.]

             and be willing to participate in the study, as documented by written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria- - In order to be eligible for study participation, a patient MUST NOT:

          -  Have a heart rate &lt;50 or &gt;110 beats per minute (bpm) at baseline;

          -  Have a screening OR baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &gt;150mmHg or &lt;100mmHg, if

             randomization; [Note: Patients with a history of A-fib/flutter are eligible, if heart
             rate is controlled with a ventricular rate not exceeding 100bpm.]

          -  Have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) of 10 beats or more during any
             bedside monitoring within 2 hours prior to randomization, or have excessive premature

        <title>Mean Time-Averaged Percent Change From Baseline in Cardiac Index (Fick)</title>
        <description>Cardiac index is a measure of cardiac function, relating the cardiac output from the left ventricle in one minute to body surface area. It is calculated using the Fick principle, using oxygen consumption measured with a metabolic cart, hemoglobin levels, and the difference between arterial and superior vena cava oxygen saturation measured by co-oximetry. Cardiac index as calculated by the Fick method was performed using an assumed oxygen consumption value of 125 ml/min per m2 of body surface area. i.e., an assumed Fick method.</description>
