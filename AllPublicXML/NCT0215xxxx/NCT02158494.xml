  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that electrical stimulation to the tongue that directly
      stimulates two cranial nerve nuclei (Trigeminal and Facial Nerve Nuclei), will excite neural
      impulses to the brainstem and cerebellum. The investigators call this cranial nerve
      non-invasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM). The activation of these structures induces
      neuroplasticity when combined with specific physical, cognitive and/or mental exercises,
      promoting recovery of selected functional damage such as problems with balance or walking.

      44 subjects will be recruited for 2 weeks of intensive In-Lab Balance and Gait Training
      followed by 12 weeks of intensive Home Training with weekly In-Lab check sessions. Half of
      the subjects will use CN-NINM in conjunction with the exercise. Half of the subjects will use
      very low level stimulation in conjunction with the exercise, and will serve as a control
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Based on the results of the investigators pilot study in moderate traumatic brain injury
           (M-TBI), the investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled study of cranial nerve
           non-invasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM) in individuals with chronic symptoms of mild to
           moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI), post-concussive sequelae, (PCS) and
           post-traumatic stress (PTS).

        -  The study will involve training of both balance and gait, with assessments using
           standardized and relevant metrics to monitor changes in these indications, as well as
           cognitive function, sleep, headache, anxiety, mood, and eye-movement control.

        -  The training regimen involves using a neurostimulation intervention that addresses
           primary and secondary symptoms associated with mTBI, PCS, and PTS.

        -  This randomized double blind controlled study will enroll a total of 44 subjects (M &amp; F)
           in 2 equal subgroups: 22 with an Active PoNSâ„¢, and 22 with a Control (non-zero,
           minimally perceivable stimulation) device.

        -  Subjects will participate in a 3-phase intervention beginning with a 2-week in-lab
           training program (ITP) (2 in-lab training sessions and 1 home training session daily),
           followed by 12 weeks of training at home (HTP) (3 home training sessions daily), and a
           12-week withdrawal period (no training). Subjects will return to the clinic weekly
           during the at-home phase for a single session of retraining and progression, and
           participate in periodic retesting.

        -  All training and testing will be performed uniformly across all subjects in both groups.
           Multiple assessment metrics will capture data at the beginning and end of the 2-week
           in-lab CN-NINM intervention period and at 3-week intervals. After completion of the
           formal training period, subjects will stop using the device (withdrawal stage) and will
           be tested every 3 weeks over an additional 12 weeks to monitor and assess changes due to
           withdrawal of the PoNS. This will yield a total of 10 data points for each subject.

        -  If successful, this study would indicate that CN-NINM may improve rehabilitation
           outcomes and reduce time required to improve function.

    <measure>NeuroCom Computerized Dynamic Posturography Sensory Organization Test (SOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 14, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SOT assesses the ability to use visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular cues to maintain postural stability. Subjects stand on dual-force plates and the anterior-posterior sway is recorded. 6 conditions are tested (3, 20-sec trials each): Eyes open on firm surface; Eyes closed on firm surface; Eyes open with sway referenced visual surround; Eyes open on sway referenced support surface; Eyes closed on sway referenced support surface; Eyes open on sway referenced support surface and surround.
A composite score is generated by the NeuroCom BalanceMaster System using an algorithm to calculate the composite score from each of the 3 serial repetitions for each of the 6 conditions (a total of 18 sub-scores). The calculated composite score ranges from 0 to 100 points; 0 is complete failure, 100 is perfect stability, 70 is the lower limit normal. Group mean score for each time-point is reported.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) Over Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2,14, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses walking, walking with head turns, over and around obstacles, and stairs. Dynamic Gait Index - A semiquantitative tool used to evaluate a patient's ability to modify gait by changing task demands, esp. in patients with dizziness and balance deficits. This test is used to identify patients, esp. older adults, who are predisposed to falling. Participants are graded from 0 (low function) to 3 (high function) on 8 tasks: normal walking, their ability to vary walking speed, turn their heads, turn their bodies, step over and around obstacles, climb stairs, turn while walking. The range of scores is 0-24, higher scores indicate higher function, with a score of 24 considered Normal. Change from baseline to 2, 14, and 26 weeks is reported.</description>

        <title>NeuroCom Computerized Dynamic Posturography Sensory Organization Test (SOT)</title>
        <description>SOT assesses the ability to use visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular cues to maintain postural stability. Subjects stand on dual-force plates and the anterior-posterior sway is recorded. 6 conditions are tested (3, 20-sec trials each): Eyes open on firm surface; Eyes closed on firm surface; Eyes open with sway referenced visual surround; Eyes open on sway referenced support surface; Eyes closed on sway referenced support surface; Eyes open on sway referenced support surface and surround.
A composite score is generated by the NeuroCom BalanceMaster System using an algorithm to calculate the composite score from each of the 3 serial repetitions for each of the 6 conditions (a total of 18 sub-scores). The calculated composite score ranges from 0 to 100 points; 0 is complete failure, 100 is perfect stability, 70 is the lower limit normal. Group mean score for each time-point is reported.</description>

Subjects will participate in a 3-phase intervention beginning with a 2-week in-lab training program (ITP) (2 in-lab training sessions and 1 home training session daily), followed by 12 weeks of training at home (HTP) (3 home training sessions daily), and a 12-week withdrawal period (no training). Subjects will return to the clinic weekly during the at-home phase for a single session of retraining and progression, and participate in periodic retesting.</description>

        <title>Change in Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) Over Baseline</title>
        <description>Assesses walking, walking with head turns, over and around obstacles, and stairs. Dynamic Gait Index - A semiquantitative tool used to evaluate a patient's ability to modify gait by changing task demands, esp. in patients with dizziness and balance deficits. This test is used to identify patients, esp. older adults, who are predisposed to falling. Participants are graded from 0 (low function) to 3 (high function) on 8 tasks: normal walking, their ability to vary walking speed, turn their heads, turn their bodies, step over and around obstacles, climb stairs, turn while walking. The range of scores is 0-24, higher scores indicate higher function, with a score of 24 considered Normal. Change from baseline to 2, 14, and 26 weeks is reported.</description>

        <description>Assesses visual spatial abilities. The Symbol Search and Coding WAIS-IV subtests measure Processing Speed, an indicator of the rate of cognitive processing and creating an appropriate response output. The tasks require attending to visual material, visual scanning and perception, spatial organization, hand-eye coordination, and paired associative learning. The raw score (processing speed for each test) is converted to a scaled score 1-10 for each and summed for a total possible score of 2-20, the higher the score, the more improved the processing speed. Change in score from baseline to 2, 14, and 26 weeks are reported.</description>
