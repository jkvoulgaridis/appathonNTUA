  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BEMA Fentanyl (Onsolis) at any dose
      in the management of breakthrough pain in cancer subjects on background opioid therapy. The
      standard of care for these breakthrough pain episodes is a rapid onset, short acting
      analgesic with minimal associated sleepiness. Oral morphine, oxycodone and hydromorphone are
      routinely used, but because of slow and variable oral absorption, the pain control is not the
      best with these products. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) has been used
      successfully in treating breakthrough pain episodes associated with cancer. OTFC is a lozenge
      of fentanyl on a stick and is administered by continuously swabbing the interior of the
      subject's mouth until the product is dissolved (approximately 15 to 30 minutes). The buccal
      route of administration avoids the delay and variability associated with oral absorption.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple cross-over study. Eligible
      subjects will be treated with open label BEMA fentanyl over a period of up to two weeks.
      Doses will be titrated upward, starting at 200 μg, until a dose is identified that produces
      satisfactory pain relief for at least 2 episodes. Those subjects who identify a dose of BEMA
      fentanyl that produces satisfactory relief of breakthrough pain episodes will enter the
      double-blind, placebo controlled period of the trial. They will receive 3 placebo doses and 6
      BEMA fentanyl doses in a random sequence per randomization schedule.

    <description>Pain intensity (using an 11-point [0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain] numeric scale) was recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after dosing. Pain intensity difference (PID) was defined as the baseline pain score minus the pain score of each time point. The primary endpoint was the Summary of Pain Intensity Differences at 30 minutes after dosing (SPID 30) in ITT population for Onsolis versus placebo during double-blind period of study. SPID was calculated as a weighted sum of the PID of all time points at or before time point of interest.Range of possible SPID values is
-10X time point (minutes) to 10X time point (minutes). Higher value indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity (using an 11-point [0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain] numeric scale) was recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after dosing. Pain intensity difference (PID) was defined as the baseline pain score minus the pain score of each time point. The primary endpoint was the Summary of Pain Intensity Differences at 30 minutes after dosing (SPID 30) in ITT population for Onsolis versus placebo during double-blind period of study. SPID was calculated as a weighted sum of the PID of all time points at or before time point of interest.Range of possible SPID values is -10X time point (minutes) to 10X time point (minutes). Higher value indicates a better outcome. SPID was calculated as a weighted sum of the pain intensity difference of all time points at or before the time point of interest for the Neuropathic pain subpopulation for relevant time points (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes). Neuropathic pain subpopulation is a subset of ITT population who have neuropathic pain at baseline.</description>

    <description>BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI) has developed BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA) Fentanyl, an alternative product to OTFC that does not require the subject to continuously paint the inside of the mouth with the dosage form. The BDSI product is a small soluble film that is placed against the mucosal membrane inside the mouth. The mucoadhesive polymers in the film readily adhere to the mucosal membrane (within 5 seconds) when moistened. The components of the film are water soluble, so the entire dosage form dissolves within 30 minutes of application.</description>

          -  Patient must have pain associated with cancer or cancer treatment.

          -  Patient must be on a stable current regimen of oral opioids equivalent to 60 - 1000
             mg/day of oral morphine or 50 - 300 µg/hr of transdermal fentanyl (e.g. oxycodone 30
             mg, methadone 20 mg, and hydromorphone 7.5 mg).

          -  Regularly experiences 1 - 4 breakthrough pain episodes per day that require additional
             opioids for pain control

          -  At least partial relief of breakthrough pain by use of opioid therapy

          -  Subject must be able to self-administer the study medication correctly.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to complete the electronic diary card with each pain
             episode.

          -  Signed consent must be obtained at screening prior to any procedures being performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychiatric/cognitive or neurological impairment that would limit the subject's
             ability to understand or complete the diary

          -  Cardiopulmonary disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would significantly
             increase the risk of respiratory depression

          -  Recent history or current evidence of alcohol or other drug substance (licit or
             illicit) abuse

          -  Rapidly escalating pain that the investigator believes may require an increase in the
             dosage of background pain medication during the study

          -  Moderate (Grade 3) to severe (Grade 4) mucositis (Subjects with less than moderate
             mucositis are permitted and must be instructed to not apply the BEMA disc at a site of
             inflammation.)

          -  Strontium 89 therapy within the previous 6 months

          -  Any other therapy prior to the study that the investigator considers could alter pain
             or the response to pain medication.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 4 weeks preceding this study

          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to fentanyl

          -  Regularly more than 4 episodes per day

        <title>Summary of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID)</title>
        <description>Pain intensity (using an 11-point [0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain] numeric scale) was recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after dosing. Pain intensity difference (PID) was defined as the baseline pain score minus the pain score of each time point. The primary endpoint was the Summary of Pain Intensity Differences at 30 minutes after dosing (SPID 30) in ITT population for Onsolis versus placebo during double-blind period of study. SPID was calculated as a weighted sum of the PID of all time points at or before time point of interest.Range of possible SPID values is
-10X time point (minutes) to 10X time point (minutes). Higher value indicates a better outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>0-30 minutes</time_frame>
        <population>In double-blind period, subjects received 3 doses placebo and 6 doses Onsolis. Mean SPID of Onsolis episodes and mean SPID of placebo episodes are calculated per subject and are used in analysis.Missing data were imputed on an episode-by-episode basis by carrying forward last observed data value (last observation carried forward [LOCF]).</population>

Pain intensity difference (PID) was defined as the baseline pain score minus the pain score of each time point. The primary endpoint was the Summary of Pain Intensity Differences at 30 minutes after dosing (SPID 30) in ITT population for Onsolis versus placebo during double-blind period of study. SPID was calculated as a weighted sum of the PID of all time points at or before time point of interest.Range of possible SPID values is -10X time point (minutes) to 10X time point (minutes).

        <title>SPID in Neuropathic Pain Subpopulation</title>
        <description>Pain intensity (using an 11-point [0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain] numeric scale) was recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after dosing. Pain intensity difference (PID) was defined as the baseline pain score minus the pain score of each time point. The primary endpoint was the Summary of Pain Intensity Differences at 30 minutes after dosing (SPID 30) in ITT population for Onsolis versus placebo during double-blind period of study. SPID was calculated as a weighted sum of the PID of all time points at or before time point of interest.Range of possible SPID values is -10X time point (minutes) to 10X time point (minutes). Higher value indicates a better outcome.

      <desc>At each visit, after the subject had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the investigator inquired about AEs by asking the following:
Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/assessment?
Have you taken any new medications, other than those given to you in this study, since your last visit/assessment?</desc>

          <description>All AEs were assigned to BEMA™ Fentanyl (Onsolis). Because of the multiple crossover design and the number of breakthrough pain episodes that usually occur during the day, it was likely that a subject would receive both active and placebo doses within a few hours of each other. Given the proximity of these different treatments, attempts to ascribe individual AEs to one treatment or another would be difficult, therefore, the chosen convention was to consider all AEs as occurring on active medication.</description>
