  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of people in this country are overweight or obese. This is concerning as
      increasing weight has been shown to increase the risk of developing heart failure. However,
      there is also research to suggest that in people who already have heart failure, heavier
      people live longer. So, how does being overweight put a person at risk for heart failure, but
      once they have heart failure, protect them? There is no clear explanation for this dilemma.

      People who are obese commonly have other diseases, such as high blood pressure, high
      cholesterol, and diabetes, that increase the risk of developing heart disease. It is this
      group of diseases that is referred to as &quot;The Metabolic Syndrome.&quot; People with the metabolic
      syndrome also have increased levels of inflammation and clotting proteins in their blood
      stream. Current treatment of the metabolic syndrome involves using medications for
      cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. Diet and exercise are also commonly recommended.

      &quot;Lifestyle intervention programs&quot; are programs that help people lose weight by changing their
      eating habits and exercise / activity routines. Weight loss and exercise have been shown to
      lower the risk of developing diabetes and improve diabetes control, improve cholesterol
      abnormalities, and lower blood pressure. These programs have not previously included heart
      failure patients, however.

      We hypothesize that using a lifestyle intervention program in addition to the usual
      medications for heart failure will result in improved symptoms of heart failure and control
      of the metabolic syndrome.

      This study will be the first research study to look at the use of diet and exercise in
      treating heart failure patients who are overweight / obese with &quot;the metabolic syndrome.&quot; The
      study will last 6 months. From this study we hope to learn whether diet and exercise is
      helpful in treating heart failure patients who are overweight. Specifically, the study will
      look at the short term effects on cardiac risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood
      sugar), heart failure symptoms, and exercise capacity.
