    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Major Symptom Complex (MSC) Score Over Period I</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Treatment Period 1 [Day 1, from drug intake (at 11:00 am) to 5 hours post-treatment (at 4:00 pm)]</time_frame>
    <description>Six individual symptoms which are most dominant in the rhinitis symptom profile will be combined to form the MSC severity score:
Runny nose (right and left), itchy nose (right and left), sniffles, nose blows, sneezes, watery eyes.
Each individual symptom, except nose blows and sneezes, is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None, 1 = a little, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe. For nose blows and sneezes, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8. The total MSC score ranges from 0 - 36. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Major Symptom Complex (MSC) Score Over Period I</title>
        <description>Six individual symptoms which are most dominant in the rhinitis symptom profile will be combined to form the MSC severity score:
Runny nose (right and left), itchy nose (right and left), sniffles, nose blows, sneezes, watery eyes.
Each individual symptom, except nose blows and sneezes, is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None, 1 = a little, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe. For nose blows and sneezes, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8. The total MSC score ranges from 0 - 36. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the MSC Score Over Period II</title>
        <description>Six individual symptoms which are most dominant in the rhinitis symptom profile will be combined to form the MSC severity score:
Runny nose (right and left), itchy nose (right and left), sniffles, nose blows, sneezes, watery eyes.
Each individual symptom, except nose blows and sneezes, is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None, 1 = a little, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe. For nose blows and sneezes, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8. The total MSC score ranges from 0 - 36. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

runny nose (left and right), itchy nose (left and right), sniffles, nose blows, sneezes, watery eyes, itchy eyes and ears, itchy throat, cough and postnasal drip.
Each individual symptom, except nose blows and sneezes, is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None, 1 = a little, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe. For nose blows and sneezes, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8. The TSC score ranges from 0 to 56. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <description>The TSC score was calculated as the sum of the following 10 individual symptom scores:
runny nose (left and right), itchy nose (left and right), sniffles, nose blows, sneezes, watery eyes, itchy eyes and ears, itchy throat, cough and postnasal drip.
Each individual symptom, except nose blows and sneezes, is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None, 1 = a little, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe. For nose blows and sneezes, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8.
The Nasal congestion score ranged from 0 to 4 (0 = clear, 1 = slight block, 2 = stuffy, 3 = very stuffy, 4 = blocked). It corresponds to the mean value of right nostril and left nostril. The TSC score plus Nasal congestion score was added and ranged from 0 to 60. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

The subjects had to evaluate the severity of the symptoms using a scale from &quot;None&quot; to &quot;Very severe&quot; (ranging from 0 to 5).
For Sneezes Score and Nose Blows Score, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8.
The Nasal congestion score ranged from 0 to 4 (0 = clear, 1 = slight block, 2 = stuffy, 3 = very stuffy, 4 = blocked). It corresponds to the mean value of right nostril and left nostril.
Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Individual Symptom Scores Over Period III</title>
        <description>Individual symptom scores include Runny Nose Score, Itchy Nose Score, Sniffles Score, Postnasal Drip Score, Watery Eyes Score, Itchy Eyes and Ears Score, Itchy Throat Score, Cough Score, Sneezes Score, Nose Blows Score, Nasal Congestion Score.
The subjects had to evaluate the severity of the symptoms using a scale from &quot;None&quot; to &quot;Very severe&quot; (ranging from 0 to 5).
For Sneezes Score and Nose Blows Score, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8.
The Nasal congestion score ranged from 0 to 4 (0 = clear, 1 = slight block, 2 = stuffy, 3 = very stuffy, 4 = blocked). It corresponds to the mean value of right nostril and left nostril.
Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Individual Symptom Scores Over the Total Treatment Period (Period I + Period II + Period III)</title>
        <description>Individual symptom scores include Runny Nose Score, Itchy Nose Score, Sniffles Score, Postnasal Drip Score, Watery Eyes Score, Itchy Eyes and Ears Score, Itchy Throat Score, Cough Score, Sneezes Score, Nose Blows Score, Nasal Congestion Score.
The subjects had to evaluate the severity of the symptoms using a scale from &quot;None&quot; to &quot;Very severe&quot; (ranging from 0 to 5).
For Sneezes Score and Nose Blows Score, the subjects had to record the number of each symptom since last evaluation. This number corresponds to a score ranging from 0 to 8.
The Nasal congestion score ranged from 0 to 4 (0 = clear, 1 = slight block, 2 = stuffy, 3 = very stuffy, 4 = blocked). It corresponds to the mean value of right nostril and left nostril.
Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity. Negative values indicate improvement from Baseline.</description>
