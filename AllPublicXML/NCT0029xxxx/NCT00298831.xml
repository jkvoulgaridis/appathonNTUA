  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the time-course of recovery to a T4/T1 ratio
      of 0.9 within 4 minutes after 4.0 mg.kg^-1 Sugammadex is administered at least 15 minutes
      after the last administration of rocuronium in a wide range of surgical procedures and
      anesthetic regimens (routine use). Safety evaluation is part of the study.

    <measure>Time From Start of MK-8616 Administration to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 30 minutes following administration of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean time from start of MK-8616 administration to recovery of participant T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was assessed through the repeated application (every 15 seconds) of an electrical stimulation protocol. Specifically, 4 electrical stimulations were applied to the ulnar nerve and the magnitude of the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle (i.e. thumb twitch response) was assessed. With T4 and T1 referring to the respective magnitude of the fourth and first thumb twitch during nerve stimulation, the T4/T1 ratio indicates the current degree of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) present in the participant as a decimal from 0 (loss of T4 twitch) to 1 (no NMB). Further, reduced recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB. Summary data, originally presented in the format of units &quot;minutes:seconds&quot; (mm:ss), was reformatted to be presented in the single unit of &quot;minutes&quot; (min).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessment of Recovery - Participant's Level of Consciousness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of recovery was assessed by asking the participant 40 questions from a validated Quality of Recovery Questionnaire (QoR-40). Participants were assessed for level of consciousness (i.e., awake and oriented, arousable with minimal stimulation, responsive only to tactile stimulation), if applicable, by asking their name, if they are aware of where they are, and what day it is. Assessment 1 occurred prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and Assessment 2 occurred prior to discharge from the recovery room.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessments of Recovery - Participant Able to Perform 5-second Head Lift (5SHL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>5-second head lift test was assessment of the ability of the participant to lift the head for 5 seconds and was performed by a blinded safety assessor. Tests were repeated every 15 minutes until the participant could successfully perform the 5-second head-lift. Assessment 1 occurred prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and Assessment 2 occurred prior to discharge from the recovery room.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessments of Recovery - Check for General Muscle Weakness (GMW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>General muscle weakness check was assessed by the investigator. The assessment of general muscle weakness was based on a scale from 0-10, with 0 representing total paralysis, 1 signifying extreme impairment, 9 for close to no impairment, and 10 for normal muscle strength. Scores of 3, 4, 5, etc. denoted increasing muscle strength in approximately 10% increments. Scores of 9 and lower were denoted as GMW. Assessment 1 occurred prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and assessment 2 occurred prior to discharge from the recovery room.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of MK-8616 Administration to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9</title>
        <description>Mean time from start of MK-8616 administration to recovery of participant T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 was assessed through the repeated application (every 15 seconds) of an electrical stimulation protocol. Specifically, 4 electrical stimulations were applied to the ulnar nerve and the magnitude of the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle (i.e. thumb twitch response) was assessed. With T4 and T1 referring to the respective magnitude of the fourth and first thumb twitch during nerve stimulation, the T4/T1 ratio indicates the current degree of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) present in the participant as a decimal from 0 (loss of T4 twitch) to 1 (no NMB). Further, reduced recovery time of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 indicates faster recovery from NMB.

At least 15 minutes after the intubation dose or the last maintenance dose of rocuronium, an intravenous single bolus dose of 4.0 mg/kg MK-8616 was administered.</description>

          <title>Clinical Assessments of Recovery - Check for General Muscle Weakness (GMW)</title>
          <description>General muscle weakness check was assessed by the investigator. The assessment of general muscle weakness was based on a scale from 0-10, with 0 representing total paralysis, 1 signifying extreme impairment, 9 for close to no impairment, and 10 for normal muscle strength. Scores of 3, 4, 5, etc. denoted increasing muscle strength in approximately 10% increments. Scores of 9 and lower were denoted as GMW. Assessment 1 occurred prior to transfer to the recovery room after extubation and assessment 2 occurred prior to discharge from the recovery room.</description>
