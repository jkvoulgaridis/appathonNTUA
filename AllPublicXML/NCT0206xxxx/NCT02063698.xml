  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies whether auranofin will relieve pain following
      paclitaxel in patients who have previously experienced paclitaxel-induced pain. Auranofin is
      a drug given by mouth to treat other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is being
      studied to see if it will decrease pain following paclitaxel.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether one dose of auranofin given the day following administration of
      paclitaxel decreases pain as assessed by daily completion of the Modified Brief Pain
      Inventory scale for seven days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess whether auranofin is well tolerated in this setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) on day 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on day 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 21-28 days.

    <measure>Count/Percentage of Patients Who Report Having Experienced the Paclitaxel-induced Pain Syndrome (PIAPS) for One Week After Paclitaxel After Enrollment to the Current Trial, Assessed by the Modified Brief Pain Inventory Scale (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the per arm count/percentage of patients who report having experienced the PIAPS for one week after paclitaxel after enrollment to the current trial. Pain was assessed on the question 'Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours'. The count of participants who report having experienced the PIAPS for one week after paclitaxel after enrollment to the current trial circling 'less than 4' and 'greater than or equal to 4' for each day between day 2 to day 8 are reported below. Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores corresponding to more /worse pain. Fisher's Exact Test will be used to compare the frequency of patients who experienced PIAPS between the two arms.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) Summary of Worst Pain in the Last 24 Hours From Days 2 to 8</measure>

    <description>Area under the curve (AUC) Summary of Worst Pain in the last 24 hours from days 2 to 8. On a scale of 0-100, with 100=Best QOL. Pain was assessed on the question 'Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours.' Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores corresponding to more pain. The AUC for this question was then calculated and ranged from 0-100, with higher scores corresponding to less/improved pain. The Equal Variance T-test will be used to compare the average AUC for worst pain between the two arms.</description>

    <description>Normalized AUC for BPI Average pain from the modified BPI in the last 24 hours from days 2 to 8. On a scale of 0-100 with 100:Best QOL. Pain was assessed on the question 'Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain on the average.' Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores corresponding to more pain. The AUC for this question was then calculated and ranged from 0-100, with higher scores corresponding to less/improved pain. The Equal Variance T-test will be used to compare the average AUC for worst pain between the two arms.</description>

        <title>Count/Percentage of Patients Who Report Having Experienced the Paclitaxel-induced Pain Syndrome (PIAPS) for One Week After Paclitaxel After Enrollment to the Current Trial, Assessed by the Modified Brief Pain Inventory Scale (BPI)</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is the per arm count/percentage of patients who report having experienced the PIAPS for one week after paclitaxel after enrollment to the current trial. Pain was assessed on the question 'Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours'. The count of participants who report having experienced the PIAPS for one week after paclitaxel after enrollment to the current trial circling 'less than 4' and 'greater than or equal to 4' for each day between day 2 to day 8 are reported below. Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores corresponding to more /worse pain. Fisher's Exact Test will be used to compare the frequency of patients who experienced PIAPS between the two arms.</description>

        <description>Area under the curve (AUC) Summary of Worst Pain in the last 24 hours from days 2 to 8. On a scale of 0-100, with 100=Best QOL. Pain was assessed on the question 'Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours.' Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores corresponding to more pain. The AUC for this question was then calculated and ranged from 0-100, with higher scores corresponding to less/improved pain. The Equal Variance T-test will be used to compare the average AUC for worst pain between the two arms.</description>

          <title>Normalized AUC for BPI Average Pain From the Modified BPI in the Last 24 Hours From Days 2 to 8</title>
          <description>Normalized AUC for BPI Average pain from the modified BPI in the last 24 hours from days 2 to 8. On a scale of 0-100 with 100:Best QOL. Pain was assessed on the question 'Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your pain on the average.' Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores corresponding to more pain. The AUC for this question was then calculated and ranged from 0-100, with higher scores corresponding to less/improved pain. The Equal Variance T-test will be used to compare the average AUC for worst pain between the two arms.</description>

      <desc>Each CTCAE term is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT). All graded AEs are reported for patients who completed the study. Serious AE (SAE) reports may include any secondary serious or non-serious events considered related to the primary event (the reason for filing an expedited report); collectively, these events are referred to as Expedited AEs, and appear in the SAE table.</desc>
