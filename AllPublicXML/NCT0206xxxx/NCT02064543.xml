  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a prospective trial comparing Zeno/GAITRite and APDM® in a cohort of persons
      living with parkinsonian disorders. Ambulatory patients with a parkinsonian syndrome and who
      are able to provide informed consent will participate in the assessments.

      Outcome variables include selected gait and balance parameters such as cadence, gait-cycle,
      stride-length, stride-velocity, turning duration, turning steps, postural sway and
      anticipatory postural control. These parameters will be measured by the portable inertial
      sensors developed by APDM® and the Zeno/GaitRite.

      Testing

      Participants after screening and consenting will:

        1. Have their height measured and fit with the APDM Opals (each device is a two inch square
           attached by velcro), one device is attached to each leg, each arm, and the trunk and
           chest and receive an introduction to walking on the gait mat.

        2. Participants are then asked to walk at a self selected walking speed down the gait mat.
           The participants will complete multiple passes (8-10 passes, total 75-100 feet) across
           the gait mat while wearing the APDM units to concurrently collect all temporal and
           spatial data needed to answer the research question. The Zeno mat is the intended
           primary gait mat for this study. The GaitRite will only be utilized in the case of a
           technical issue with the Zeno in order to insure completion of the data collection.
