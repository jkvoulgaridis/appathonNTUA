    <measure>Change From Baseline to Last 5 Days of Treatment in the Average Evening Pain Intensity In the Target Knee When Walking on a Flat Surface Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day -5 to day -1), Last 5 days of treatment (day 24 to day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] is a widely used, validated, patient-reported questionnaire used to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with OA of the knee. It consists of 24 items separated into 3 domains (pain [5 items], stiffness [2 items], and physical function [17 items]). WOMAC Question 1 is the first question in the pain domain and asks patients to rate their pain in the target knee while walking on a flat surface. The possible score for each item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain). Participants record their response to WOMAC Question 1 in the study diary based on average pain upon walking since the last assessment or over the past 12 hours. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC Question 1 score as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (day -5 to day -1), Last 5 days of treatment (day 24 to day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The five items in the WOMAC Pain Subscale cover pain during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing. Daily WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the sum of the 5-item pain subscale scores (WOMAC) recorded at evening for a total range of 0 (no pain) to 500 (worst pain on all 5 items). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC scores for the 5-item pain subscale as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a &gt;=30% and a &gt;=50% Response in Average Evening Pain Intensity of WOMAC Question 1 in the Target Knee During the Last 5 Days of Treatment Compared With Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day -5 to day -1), Last 5 days of treatment (day 24 to day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC Question 1 is the first question in the pain domain and asks patients to rate their pain in the target knee while walking on a flat surface. The possible score for each item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain). Average pain is calculated using a MMRM which includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC Question 1 score as a covariate; and patient as a random factor. Responder rate was calculated as 100 * the value of (average WOMAC pain subscale during the last 5 days of treatment [Days 24 to 28]) - average WOMAC pain subscale at baseline [the 5 days prior to randomization])/average WOMAC pain subscale at baseline (the 5 days prior to randomization). Participants with missing responder rates were treated as nonresponders.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Randomization Visit) to the Week 4 Visit in the Pain Quality Assessment Scale - Revised (PQAS-R) for the Target Knee Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1, predose), Treatment: Week 4 (day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>PQAS-R is a standardized self-report tool that measures various aspects of a participant's pain. There are 19 questions (question 19 has 2 parts) that ask the participant to rate the various aspects (intensity, sharpness, heat, cold, etc.) of his/her pain over the past week on average on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = not [aspect] and 10 = the most or worst imaginable [aspect]). PQAS-R score at each visit is the sum of responses for the 19 questions for a total range of 0=no pain to 200=worst imaginable pain in all aspects. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in stiffness. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline PQAS-R score for the 19 questions (20 parts) as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) Scores at Weeks 2 and 4 Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1, predose), Week 2 (day 15) and Week 4 (day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>PGA is a simple self-report tool for measuring the overall way arthritis is affecting the patient at a particular point in time. There is 1 question and the response is provided on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (very poor) to 100 (very good). The question is: Considering all the ways your arthritis affect you, how are you feeling today? Positive change from baseline scores indicate improvement. The MMRM model includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as the fixed factors; baseline PGA score as a covariate and unconstructed variance-covariance structure.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Are Responders Per Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) Criteria at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 (day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are classified as 'Yes' if the following criteria are met: - &gt;=50% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=20 on a scale of 1-100 in either the pain or physical function subscale (WOMAC). or 2 of the 3 criteria as below met: - 1) &gt;=20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=10 on a scale of 1-100 in the pain subscale (WOMAC); - 2) &gt;=20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=10 on a scale of 1-100 in the physical function subscale (WOMAC); - 3) at least a 20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=10 on a scale of 1-100 in PGA. Otherwise, 'No' The responder rate per OMERACT-OARSI criteria was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) method, where binary variable responder rate (Yes/No) was modeled through logit link function, with treatment, center, week, and treatment*week as explanatory factors. The unstructured working correlation structure was applied.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>978 patients with primary OA of the knee were screened for enrollment into this study. 389 patients at 41 centers in the US met entry criteria. Of the 589 patients not enrolled, 551 were excluded on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria, 25 patients withdrew consent, and 8 patients were lost to follow-up before the baseline visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After stratification by R1150W polymorphism status: - homozygous minor allele (positive, AA), - heterozygous (positive, AG), and - homozygous common allele (negative, GG), participants were randomly assigned by interactive response technology (IRT) to receive treatment in 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>R1150W Polymorphism Status</title>
          <description>Patients who carry the R1150W polymorphism have a nucleotide containing adenine (A) instead of guanine (G) in the rs6746030 single nucleotide polymorphism in the SCN9A gene. This change causes an arginine to tryptophan amino acid residue change at position 1150 in the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7. Those who carry the R1150W polymorphism may be heterozygous (GA) or homozygous (AA) for the minor allele. This R1150W polymorphism in the SCN9A gene may affect pain perception (Reimann et al 2010).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last 5 Days of Treatment in the Average Evening Pain Intensity In the Target Knee When Walking on a Flat Surface Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)</title>
        <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] is a widely used, validated, patient-reported questionnaire used to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with OA of the knee. It consists of 24 items separated into 3 domains (pain [5 items], stiffness [2 items], and physical function [17 items]). WOMAC Question 1 is the first question in the pain domain and asks patients to rate their pain in the target knee while walking on a flat surface. The possible score for each item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain). Participants record their response to WOMAC Question 1 in the study diary based on average pain upon walking since the last assessment or over the past 12 hours. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC Question 1 score as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last 5 Days of Treatment in the Average Daily WOMAC Pain Subscale Score In the Target Knee Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
        <description>The five items in the WOMAC Pain Subscale cover pain during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing. Daily WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the sum of the 5-item pain subscale scores (WOMAC) recorded at evening for a total range of 0 (no pain) to 500 (worst pain on all 5 items). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC scores for the 5-item pain subscale as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (day -5 to day -1), Last 5 days of treatment (day 24 to day 28)</time_frame>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Last 5 Days of Treatment in the Average Daily WOMAC Pain Subscale Score In the Target Knee Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
          <description>The five items in the WOMAC Pain Subscale cover pain during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing. Daily WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the sum of the 5-item pain subscale scores (WOMAC) recorded at evening for a total range of 0 (no pain) to 500 (worst pain on all 5 items). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC scores for the 5-item pain subscale as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Last 5 Days of Treatment in the Average Morning Pain Intensity In the Target Knee When Walking on a Flat Surface Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)</title>
        <description>The Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] is a widely used, validated, patient-reported questionnaire used to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with OA of the knee. It consists of 24 items separated into 3 domains (pain [5 items], stiffness [2 items], and physical function [17 items]). The possible score for each item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain). WOMAC Question 1 is the first question in the pain domain and asks patients to rate their pain in the target knee while walking on a flat surface. Participants record their response to WOMAC Question 1 in the study diary based on average pain upon walking since the last assessment or over the past 12 hours. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average morning WOMAC Question 1 score as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (day -5 to day -1), Last 5 days of treatment (day 24 to day 28)</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) include all patients in the intent to treat (ITT) population who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment. Both baseline and treatment values must be available for a participant to be included.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline (Randomization Visit) to the Week 4 Visit in the WOMAC Stiffness Subscale Score for the Target Knee Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
          <description>The two items in the WOMAC stiffness subscale cover stiffness after first waking and later in the day. WOMAC stiffness subscale score is calculated as the sum of the 2-item stiffness subscale scores (WOMAC) for a total range of 0 (no stiffness) to 200 (worst stiffness on both items). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in stiffness. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline stiffness WOMAC scores for the 2-item subscale as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set. Both baseline and treatment values must be available for a participant to be included. For stiffness subscale, if both items are missing, the subscale total will not be calculated; otherwise the missing value will be replaced with the non-missing one in the subscale.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a &gt;=30% and a &gt;=50% Response in Average Evening Pain Intensity of WOMAC Question 1 in the Target Knee During the Last 5 Days of Treatment Compared With Baseline</title>
        <description>WOMAC Question 1 is the first question in the pain domain and asks patients to rate their pain in the target knee while walking on a flat surface. The possible score for each item ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain). Average pain is calculated using a MMRM which includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline average evening WOMAC Question 1 score as a covariate; and patient as a random factor. Responder rate was calculated as 100 * the value of (average WOMAC pain subscale during the last 5 days of treatment [Days 24 to 28]) - average WOMAC pain subscale at baseline [the 5 days prior to randomization])/average WOMAC pain subscale at baseline (the 5 days prior to randomization). Participants with missing responder rates were treated as nonresponders.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Randomization Visit) to the Week 4 Visit in the Pain Quality Assessment Scale - Revised (PQAS-R) for the Target Knee Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures</title>
        <description>PQAS-R is a standardized self-report tool that measures various aspects of a participant's pain. There are 19 questions (question 19 has 2 parts) that ask the participant to rate the various aspects (intensity, sharpness, heat, cold, etc.) of his/her pain over the past week on average on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = not [aspect] and 10 = the most or worst imaginable [aspect]). PQAS-R score at each visit is the sum of responses for the 19 questions for a total range of 0=no pain to 200=worst imaginable pain in all aspects. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in stiffness. MMRM includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as fixed factors; baseline PQAS-R score for the 19 questions (20 parts) as a covariate; and patient as a random factor.</description>

        <title>Participants' Global Assess of Treatment as Measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Weeks 2 and 4 Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)</title>
        <description>PGIC is a standardized self-report tool that measures the change in a participants overall status rating since the start of treatment on 7-point scale. The 7-point scale is defined as: 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse. The MMRM model includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as the fixed factors and unconstructed variance-covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) Scores at Weeks 2 and 4 Using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM)</title>
        <description>PGA is a simple self-report tool for measuring the overall way arthritis is affecting the patient at a particular point in time. There is 1 question and the response is provided on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (very poor) to 100 (very good). The question is: Considering all the ways your arthritis affect you, how are you feeling today? Positive change from baseline scores indicate improvement. The MMRM model includes week, treatment, study center, and treatment by week interaction as the fixed factors; baseline PGA score as a covariate and unconstructed variance-covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Are Responders Per Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) Criteria at Week 4</title>
        <description>Participants are classified as 'Yes' if the following criteria are met: - &gt;=50% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=20 on a scale of 1-100 in either the pain or physical function subscale (WOMAC). or 2 of the 3 criteria as below met: - 1) &gt;=20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=10 on a scale of 1-100 in the pain subscale (WOMAC); - 2) &gt;=20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=10 on a scale of 1-100 in the physical function subscale (WOMAC); - 3) at least a 20% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;=10 on a scale of 1-100 in PGA. Otherwise, 'No' The responder rate per OMERACT-OARSI criteria was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) method, where binary variable responder rate (Yes/No) was modeled through logit link function, with treatment, center, week, and treatment*week as explanatory factors. The unstructured working correlation structure was applied.</description>
