  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of bariatric surgery in adolescents is controversial. On one side, bariatric surgery
      is the only effective treatment to achieve sustained weight loss in adults with extreme
      obesity. Comorbidities are reversed and mortality is reduced. In adolescents, bariatric
      surgery is equally effective; however, due to the paucity of long-term data, the long-term
      effects and risks are unknown. Thus, due to surgical risk and ethical implications, bariatric
      surgery is considered experimental in Germany. Nevertheless, case volumes are increasing.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of adolescent bariatric surgery
      in the context of a structured preparation and follow-up program. The study is a subproject
      of the study &quot;Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity -
      acceptance and effects of structured care&quot; (DRKS00004172). At 5 German university centers
      (Ulm, Datteln, Berlin, Essen, Leipzig), youth who undergo bariatric surgery and are
      participants in the overall project will be enrolled in a structured preparation and
      follow-up program. The program is designed to improve adherence and compliance and will
      result in comprehensive follow-up data. In addition to the data gathered in the overall
      project, subjects participating in subproject 3 will undergo assessments pertinent to
      bariatric surgery, as proposed in the American Teen-LABS study
      (http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/ research/divisions/t/teen-labs/default/). Comparison
      will be made with BMI matched adolescents who participate in the overall project but do not
      undergo bariatric surgery.

      In November 2014 recruitment for the overall project was completed. However, patients
      interested in bariatric surgery will still be recruited until September 2016. There
      assessment will be the same as for patients recruited earlier. However, in an amendment in
      December 2014, the frequency of assessment via questionnaire was reduced from biannually to
      annually. In addition, a travel reimbursement of 30€ for each study visit was implemented.

    <description>The intervention takes place in the clinical care setting. The decision for surgery is made by a multidisciplinary team, according to the international guidelines and the recommendations of the German working group on obesity (AGA, www.a.g.a.de). The choice of procedure is made on an individual basis taking into consideration patient inherent factors as well as the recommendations of the operating center. Operations are conducted at certified bariatric centers according to the policies of the German working group on bariatric surgery (CAADIP), and in the context of a structured preparation and follow-up program. The program is offered by a multidisciplinary team (pediatrician, endocrinologist, surgeon, dietician, psychologist/psychiatrist, social worker) and comprises preparation for and education about the surgery and expected lifestyle changes, as well as a structured, multidisciplinary follow-up plan. Subjects sign a contract agreeing to adhere to the recommended follow-up schedule.</description>
