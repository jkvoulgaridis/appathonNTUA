    <textblock>
      There are wide variations in iron supplementation practices in NICU.Guidelines on pediatric
      Parenteral nutrition suggested the dose of 200μg/kg.d iron by parenteral nutrition.

      The study was approved by the ethics committee of Xinhua Hospital, and all parents gave
      written informed consent.

      Study Design This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, interventional trial of iron
      (iron sucrose) supplementation given from age of 1 day until full 2 weeks to preterm infants
      in NICU, who divided into three groups, control(PN without iron and EPO), Vifor and vifor and
      EPOE group, according to the recommended dosage of ESPEN .

      Outcome Measures General information and indicators including anemia iron storage were
      measured. And the same time oxidative stress indicators were monitored at age of 1day and 2
      weeks.

      General growth parameters including the blood sugar, liver and renal function index before
      and after the intervention were tested.

      Hematological evaluation including RBC, Hb, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RET, CRP were mesured before and
      after the intervention. The three groups were all peripheral blood.

      Iron storage evaluation including ferritin, serum iron, TIBC on the days were measured before
      and after the intervention. We used the radio-immunoassay method to test the ferritin (DADE
      BEHRING, Germany), the chemical method to the serum iron and the automatic biochemical
      analyzer (automatic biochemical analyzer, 7600, HITACH).
