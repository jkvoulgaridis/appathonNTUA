  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and the
      therapeutic potential of GSK2857916 in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphomas that
      express B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The hypothesis is that GSK2857916 can be safely
      administered to subjects with MM and with BCMA positive malignancies at doses where target
      engagement can be demonstrated. This study will determine if adequate target engagement of
      BCMA receptors translates into clinical benefit for subjects with MM and BCMA positive
      lymphomas. The study will consists of two parts: a Part 1 dose escalation phase and a Part 2
      expansion phase for safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity testing. The study
      will enroll a total of approximately 80-95 subjects with relapsed/refractory MM or
      BCMA-expressing hematologic malignancies. The maximum dose to be administered in this trial
      will not exceed 5 milligram/kilogram(mg/kg).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is a Phase1 study of antibody drug conjugate GSK2857916 in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The study was conducted in 2 parts-Part1(dose escalation) and Part 2(dose expansion).The starting dose in Part1 was 0.03 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) GSK2857916 given once every three weeks; 1 cycle= 21 days for 16 cycles.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 79 participants were enrolled. The results presented are based on the primary analysis of the MM participants from Part 1 and Part 2 only (73 participants). The data from the remaining 6 participants (BCMA expressing lymphoma) are not part of the primary analysis and will be reported at the end of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Vital signs included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), temperature (Temp) and heart rate (HR). SBP and DBP were graded using National Cancer Institute-Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0. For SBP: Grade 0-&lt;120 millimeters of mercury[mmHg], 120-139 mmHg[Grade 1], 140-159 mmHg[Grade 2], &gt;=160 mmHg[Grade 3]); For DBP: &lt;80 mmHg [Grade 0], 80-89[Grade 1], 90-99[Grade 2], &gt;=100 mmHg[Grade 3]). An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (T.Bil.), calcium (Ca), creatinine (Creat), creatinine kinase (CK), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), glucose (Gl), potassium (Pot), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Sod), phosphate (Ph) and urate. Values(Hyper and hypo)for Gl, Pot, Mg, Sod and Ca is presented. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. All increases are an increase in grade from Baseline. Baseline was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data-Part 1</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (T.Bil.), calcium (Ca), creatinine (Creat), creatinine kinase (CK), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), glucose (Gl), potassium (Pot), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Sod), phosphate (Ph) and urate. Values(Hyper and hypo)for Gl, Pot, Mg, Sod and Ca is presented. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. All increases are an increase in grade from Baseline. Baseline was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data-Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: albumin,ALP,ALT,AST,T.Bil.,Ca, Creat,CK, GGT,Gl, Pot,Mg, Sod, Ph and urate. Values(Hyper and hypo)for Gl, Pot, Mg, Sod and Ca is presented. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. All increases are an increase in grade from Baseline. Baseline was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data With Respect to Normal Range-Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: direct bilirubin (D.Bil.), chloride, carbon dioxide (CO2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein (T.Pro) and urea or blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. A laboratory value that is outside the reference range was considered either high abnormal (value above the upper limit of the reference range) or low abnormal (value below the lower limit of the reference range). If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change (NC)' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant &quot;Decreased to low&quot; and &quot;Increased to high&quot; during post-Baseline. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data With Respect to Normal Range-Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: D.Bil., chloride, CO2, LDH, T.Pro and BUN. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits.A laboratory value that is outside the reference range was considered either high abnormal (value above the upper limit of the reference range) or low abnormal (value below the lower limit of the reference range). If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or NC' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant 'Decreased to Low' and 'Increased to High' during post-Baseline.Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Hematology Data-Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocytes (Lymph), neutrophils (Neutro), platelet count (PC), and leukocytes (leuko). The laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Hematology Data-Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: Hb, Lymph, Neutro, PC, and leuko. The laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death related to AE. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits.An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to Baseline grade. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Hematology Data With Respect to Normal Range-Part 1</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: basophils (baso), eosinophils (Eosino), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), monocytes (Mono), erythrocytes (Erythro) and reticulocytes (Reticu). A laboratory value that was outside the reference range was considered either high abnormal (value above the upper limit of the reference range) or low abnormal (value below the lower limit of the reference range). Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or NC' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant 'Decreased to Low' and 'Increased to High' during post-Baseline.Data at worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Hematology Data With Respect to Normal Range-Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: baso, Eosino, Hct, MCHC, MCH, MCV, Mono, Erythro and Reticu. A laboratory value that was outside the reference range was considered either high abnormal (value above the upper limit of the reference range) or low abnormal (value below the lower limit of the reference range). Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or NC' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant 'Decreased to Low' and 'Increased to High' during post-Baseline.Data at worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Hematology Data With Respect to Normal Range-Part 2</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: baso, Eosino, Hct, MCHC, MCH, MCV, Mono, Erythro and Reticu. A laboratory value that was outside the reference range was considered either high abnormal (value above the upper limit of the reference range) or low abnormal (value below the lower limit of the reference range). Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. If values were unchanged (example: High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or NC' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant 'Decreased to Low' and 'Increased to High' during post-Baseline.Data at worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst-case Urinalysis Results Post-Baseline Relative to Baseline by Dipstick Method -Part 1</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine occult blood (OB) and urine protein (Pro). The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters were recorded as no change/decreased, increase to small (indicated by trace and 1+), increase to moderate (indicated by 2+) and increase to large (indicated by 3+ and above) for urine OB and no change/decreased, increase to trace, increase to 1+, increase to 2+ and increase to 3+ for urine Pro indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine OB and urine Pro. The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters were recorded as no change/decreased, increase to small (indicated by trace and 1+), increase to moderate (indicated by 2+) and increase to large (indicated by 3+ and above) for urine OB and no change/decreased, increase to trace, increase to 1+, increase to 2+ and increase to 3+ for urine Pro indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Data for worst-case post Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Serum samples were collected for the determination of ADA using a validated ECL immunoassay. The assay involved screening, confirmation and titration steps. If serum samples contained ADA, they were further analyzed for the specificity of antibodies by a confirmation assay. Confirmed positive samples were titrated to obtain the titers of antibodies. The number of participants with screening, confirming and negative conclusive ADA results at Baseline and different timepoints is presented.</description>
