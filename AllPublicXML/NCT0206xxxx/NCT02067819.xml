  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a trial on an oral orthotic for
      reducing tic severity in children ages 7-25 years with Tourette syndrome (TS) or Chronic Tic
      Disorder (CTD).

    <textblock>
      The study is a 2 group, 2 week randomized controlled feasibility trial of an active vs sham
      oral orthotic to reduce tic severity in children and adolescents ages 7-25 years. Responders
      to acute phase treatment will be followed for 10 additional week (12 weeks total) to assess
      intervention durability, safety and acceptability. Non-responders to the sham orthotic will
      be provided active treatment at the end of the 2 week acute phase. We aim to assess and
      enroll 24 participants; twelve participants will receive an orthotic adjusted to the
      appropriate therapeutic height, and twelve participants will receive an identical sham
      orthotic, but not adjusted to the recommended height for the given participant.

    <measure>Change in global severity of tics and clinical condition as measured by CGI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, Week 2 Visit, Week 4 Visit, Week 6 Visit, Week 8 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>To assess global severity of tics and change in the clinical condition over time as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions Scale. 2 of the 3 sub-scales are used assess this change. The Severity of Illness has a low score of 0 and high score is 7. The low score of 0 represents that the subject was not assessed and the high score of 7 represents among the most extremely ill subjects. The Global Improvement sub-scale ranges from 0-8 where the low score of 0 represents that the subject was not assessed, while the high score of 8 represents that the tics got very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Change in parent-reported number, frequency and intensity of child's motor and vocal tics as measured by PTQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, Week 2 Visit, Week 4 Visit, Week 6 Visit, Week 8 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Tic Questionnaire is parent-report measure assessing the change in number, frequency, and intensity of their child's motor and vocal tics. The parents identify whether or not their child's motor and vocal tics have been present in the last week, they mark the frequency of the tics which range 1-4. 1 represents a low score meaning that the tics occur weekly, a few times or less and 4 represents a high score stating that the tics are constant, almost all the time during the day. Then they rate the intensity of the tics which range from 0-8. A high score of an 8 represents more intense, strong, and/or noticeable tics while a low score of a 0 represents no tics present.</description>

          -  Age 7-25 inclusive.

          -  Presence of motor and/or vocal tics for at least 12 months.

          -  Tics are of at least moderate clinical severity as evidenced by a Yale Global Tic
