      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the effects of taking doxepin hydrochloride as
      compared to placebo (inactive drug) in treating esophageal pain in patients with cancer
      located in the chest area receiving radiation therapy to the thorax with or without
      chemotherapy. Doxepin hydrochloride is a tricyclic antidepressant drug which was recently
      shown to be helpful for mouth pain in patients receiving radiation therapy. Doxepin
      hydrochloride affects the surface of the esophagus, which may be helpful in reducing the pain
      caused by radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide baseline data regarding the effectiveness of doxepin (doxepin hydrochloride) in
      reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) to the
      thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes,
      1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours on day 1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the adverse event profile of doxepin swish and swallow using a patient-reported
      questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours using
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
      (RTOG) acute toxicity criteria, and also for domains of unpleasant taste, burning/stinging
      discomfort, and drowsiness.

      II. To evaluate the effectiveness of doxepin in reducing esophagitis-related pain in patients
      undergoing RT to the thorax, as measured by a patient-reported questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15
      minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hours and then at 2 and 4 hours on days 1 and 3 (including the
      cross-over phase).

      III. To compare and provide baseline data regarding alternative analgesic use between the
      doxepin and placebo arms.

      IV. To provide baseline data regarding the patients? preference for continued therapy with
      doxepin or placebo after initial test dose or after the cross-over phase, as measured by
      items 9 and 10 in the patient-reported questionnaire at 4 hours after administration of the
      study medication and the actual participation rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pain reduction and other adverse event profile in the optional continuation
      phase of doxepin oral rinse therapy. (Only applies to patients who have the optional
      continuation of doxepin oral rinse after the first two phases)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds,
      and slowly swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm II on day 3.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo oral solution (swish, gargle for 30 seconds, and slowly
      swallow) on day 1. Patients then crossover to Arm I on day 3.

      In both arms, patients may continue to receive doxepin hydrochloride oral solution every 4
      hours as needed during radiation therapy.

    <measure>Change in Mouth Pain as Measured by Average Area Under the Curve Per Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after treatment on day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of pain for the first cycle of treatment. Scores are reported on a 0-100 scale, where 100=better outcome QOL. The aAUCpa is the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment. Patients will assess their pain at baseline and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after treatment. The AUC calculation is based on the assessment number (1,2,3,4,5,6) instead of the actual number of minutes (5,15,30,60,120,240). This results in an AUC measure that is the average pain score across all of the measurements and is not a function of the number of minutes from treatment. The area under the curve of these 6 time points will be adjusted by their baseline pain score. The pain scores at each time point are given equal weights in the AUC calculation and the AUC calculation does not use the number of minutes after treatment. Therefore, the AUC measurement scale is the same as the original pain score scale.</description>

        <title>Change in Mouth Pain as Measured by Average Area Under the Curve Per Assessment</title>
        <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of pain for the first cycle of treatment. Scores are reported on a 0-100 scale, where 100=better outcome QOL. The aAUCpa is the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment. Patients will assess their pain at baseline and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after treatment. The AUC calculation is based on the assessment number (1,2,3,4,5,6) instead of the actual number of minutes (5,15,30,60,120,240). This results in an AUC measure that is the average pain score across all of the measurements and is not a function of the number of minutes from treatment. The area under the curve of these 6 time points will be adjusted by their baseline pain score. The pain scores at each time point are given equal weights in the AUC calculation and the AUC calculation does not use the number of minutes after treatment. Therefore, the AUC measurement scale is the same as the original pain score scale.</description>
