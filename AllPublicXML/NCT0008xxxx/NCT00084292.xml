      The International Pediatric Stroke Study (IPSS) was established in 2003 as a multi-center,
      multi-national clinical research registry. Over the years, it has grown to become a highly
      successful study vehicle for pediatric stroke research across over 100 institutions
      worldwide. Today, The IPSS continues to serve as the global data and imaging core for
      multi-disciplinary pediatric experts who perform international collaborative research in an
      effort to better understand, prevent, and improve outcomes in pediatric stroke. The robust
      dataset and cohesive network enable high caliber and ground-breaking research in the field.

      Participating sites enroll neonates or children who have had an ischemic stroke or are at
      high risk of having a stroke into the registry. Participants have their medical and research
      records reviewed for information about their stroke and abstracted into a secure electronic
      database called REDCap. The IPSS also provides an attractive imaging platform (through the
      Stroke Imaging Lab for Children, SILC, housed at SickKids) for sites to share clinically
      acquired brain images that will complement the clinical dataset. The clinical and imaging
      datasets will improve our understanding of the processes underlying plasticity and recovery
      in childhood stroke.

      All information captured in the study is de-identified.

      This study does not require any interventions or additional visits for research. Two outcome
      measures are typically administered during a follow-up clinic visit: the Paediatric Stroke
      Outcome Measure (PSOM) and the Recovery and Recurrence Questionnaire (RRQ). The PSOM is used
      during clinic visits by the study PI or co-investigator; the RRQ is a parental questionnaire
      that can be completed during clinic visits or by telephone interview for those parents who
      cannot attend the follow up appointment. Both measures assess neurological function in the
      following 5 domains: sensory, motor, language, cognition and behavior.

      Participating investigators will retain ownership of their own (single-site) data. However,
      by entering data into the IPSS, co-investigators give implicit permission for the IPSS to
      analyze the collective dataset. These contributing investigators are recognized through
      authorship.

      The activities of the network are creating the opportunity for manuscript writing, grant
      development and collaboration on clinical challenges in pediatric stroke.

      OBJECTIVES: This is the first multi-center, multi-national study of children with stroke. It
      seeks to build a network of investigators and high-quality disease data to enable
      population-based studies, natural history studies, and clinical trials to improve the care of
      children with stroke.

      STUDY POPULATION: Infants and children with ischemic stroke (arterial ischemic stroke and
      cerebral sinovenous thrombosis), or those at high risk (e.g. arteriopathies).

      DESIGN: This study includes a data collection component and collaborative process. Our
      network of over 150 investigators prospectively collect data on neonates or children with a
      diagnosis of stroke made after January 2003. Data on stroke diagnosis, etiology, treatment
      and outcomes are collected and entered into a secure web system, REDCap. Neuro-imaging data
      from the index event and a series of follow-up time points are captured and stored in the
      SILC-IPSS data repository.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: This study will quantify outcome event rates (initial stroke
      characteristics, recurrent stroke, mortality, neurologic deficits), which can be used in
      designing future intervention studies and determining sample sizes. Analysis will be
      primarily descriptive. Participating investigators submit investigator-initiated research
      proposals or grants with a specific focus, leveraging the clinical and imaging dataset.

    <description>The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) was developed out of a need for an objective, standardized outcome measures for children with acute, unilateral focal CNS such as cerebral infarction. The goal was to develop an assessment measure that defines clinically and functionally relevant outcome in pediatric stroke. This measure was designed for and tested in children with arterial ischemic stroke or cerebral sinovenous thrombosis.</description>

    <description>The Recurrence and Recovery Questionnaire (RRQ) was developed by converting the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) into a questionnaire for patient/parent telephone interview. The agreement and consistency of the PSOM and RRQ is then assessed, and identified conditions that contributed to differences between the 2 measures. The RRQ has been validated to capture the same 5 sub-domains as the PSOM in the event a patient cannot return to clinic for a follow-up visit and can be used as a measure of recovery post-stroke.</description>
