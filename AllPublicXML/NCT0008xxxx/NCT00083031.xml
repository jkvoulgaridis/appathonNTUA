      This randomized phase II trial is studying metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide and
      methotrexate to see how well they work compared to metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide,
      methotrexate, and bevacizumab in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.

      This study uses an investigational drug called Bevacizumab. Investigational means that this
      drug is not approved by the Federal Drug Administration and is still being studied.
      Bevacizumab is the common name for the commercial drug Avastin. The Bevacizumab used in this
      trial, however, is for use in research studies only and may be made at locations different
      from those where Avastin is made. Although some differences may exist, bevacizumab for
      research use and the commercial drug, Avastin, are manufactured by a similar process, meet
      similar standards for final product testing, and are expected to be very similar in safety
      and effectiveness.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) low-dose continuous
      chemotherapy (referred to as metronomic chemotherapy) using drugs Cytoxan (also called
      cyclophosphamide) and methotrexate (CM), with or without bevacizumab.

    <description>ORR is the proportion of patients achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST 1.0 criteria: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Both require confirmation no fewer than 4 weeks apart. CR/PR assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease evaluations occurred every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles and every 12 weeks thereafter until progression, death or lost-to-follow-up. Patients were followed for PFS up to approximately 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from study entry and documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.0 criteria or death. Patients alive without progression are censored at time of last disease assessment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancer,
             with stage IV disease. Patients without pathologic or cytologic confirmation of
             metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis by physical exam or
             radiologic study.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan. The protocol
             will employ the RECIST criteria.

          -  Prior Therapy:

               -  Chemotherapy: early stage breast cancer. Patients may have received prior
                  adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy for early stage breast cancer,
                  including cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimens.

               -  Chemotherapy: metastatic breast cancer. Patients may have received 0-1 prior
                  regimens for metastatic breast cancer. No prior oral cyclophosphamideor
                  methotrexate-based therapy for metastatic disease is permitted.

               -  Chemotherapy: anthracyclines. Patients without prior anthraycline (in either the
                  metastatic or adjuvant setting) exposure are eligible provided that they do not
                  have visceral (parenchymal lung or liver) metastases. Patients without prior
                  anthracycline-based therapy are expected to have &quot;low volume&quot; tumor burden,
                  deemed appropriate for non-standard chemotherapy in the estimation of the
                  treating clinician.

               -  Trastuzumab. Patients with HER2-positive breast tumors must have received prior
                  trastuzumab therapy for advanced disease, or have had recurrence within 12 months
                  of receiving (neo)adjuvant trastuzumab.

               -  Radiation therapy. Patients may have received prior radiation therapy in either
                  the metastatic or early stage settings. Radiation therapy may not be administered
                  during the study. Lesions progressing after previous irradiation are measurable;
                  lesions not progressing after previous irradiation are not measurable.

               -  Hormonal therapy. Patients with estrogen- or progesterone-receptor positive
                  disease must have received at least one prior hormonal therapy in the adjuvant
                  and/or metastatic setting.

                  --- Patients must discontinue chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy prior to study
                  participation.

               -  Concurrent Therapy. Patients may receive concurrent bisphosphonate therapy and/or
                  erythropoietin growth factor support while on study. Patients may not receive
                  other experimental treatments while on study. Bisphosphonate therapy and/or
                  erythropoietin growth factor support therapy may commence at any point on study.

          -  Patients may not have received prior experimental angiogenesis inhibitors.

             diatheses (including hemoptysis).

          -  Radiologic exclusion of brain metastases (because of concern for potential CNS
             bleeding with therapy). All patients must have a brain CT or MRI no more than 6 weeks
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Left ventricular function ≥ 45% as assessed by echocardiogram or nuclear medicine
             gated study.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below. Labs should be
             completed within 4 weeks prior to registration.

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mm3

               -  total bilirubin ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 4.0 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5.0 x ULN

               -  PT, PTT ≤ institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Fertility/reproduction. Patients must be neither pregnant nor expect becoming pregnant
             or conceiving a child while on study. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test. The effects of bevacizumab, methotrexate, and
             cyclophosphamide on the developing fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
             childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Exclusion Criteria

               -  Chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who have received ≥ 2 prior
                  regimens for metastatic breast cancer; or who have received prior oral
                  cyclophosphamide- or methotrexate-based therapy for metastatic disease.

               -  Patients who have not recovered from reversible adverse events due to prior
                  treatments.

               -  Patients still on hormonal therapy - including LHRH agonist therapy.

          -  Current use of anticoagulants or chronic aspirin therapy (&gt; 325 mg/day) - excluding
             low-dose warfarin used for venous access patency (doses of 1 to 2 mg/d.)

          -  History of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical
             or biologic composition to cyclophosphamide (such as other alkylating agents) or
             methotrexate (such as other antimetabolites.)

          -  Patients with recent (within 6 months) arterial thromboembolic events, including
             transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), unstable angina, or
             myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with clinically significant peripheral artery
             disease should also be excluded.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with visceral metastases unless they have previously been treated with an
             anthraycline-based chemotherapy regimen in either the metastatic or adjuvant setting.

          -  Patients may not receive other investigational agents while on study.

          -  Non-healing wounds or major surgical procedures other than for venous access device or
             diagnostic study are not permitted within 28 days prior to enrollment (because of rare
             potential risk of delayed wound healing associated with bevacizumab).

          -  Patients with large or rapidly accumulating pleural or abdominal effusions (based on
             clinician's judgment) because of the theoretical risk for methotrexate accumulation
             and related toxicity. --- If a patient's condition is deteriorating, laboratory
             evaluations should be repeated ≤ 48 hours prior to initiation of therapy.
