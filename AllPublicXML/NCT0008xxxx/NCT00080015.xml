    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, exploratory &quot;proof of concept&quot;
      study. Diflomotecan (7 mg fixed dose) will be administered as a 20-minute IV infusion once
      every 3 weeks in patients with sensitive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with progressive
      disease after first-line treatment with a platinum-based regimen.
