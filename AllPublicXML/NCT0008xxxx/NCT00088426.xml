    <textblock>
      This study will examine how holoprosencephaly (HPE) affects people, how they change over
      time, and what genes may be involved in the cause of the disorder. HPE is a defect of brain
      development in utero in which the forebrain fails to sufficiently divide into two
      hemispheres, resulting in a single-lobed brain and skull and facial malformations. In most
      cases, the defects are so severe that babies die before birth. There are three
      classifications of HPE. In alobar HPE the brain does not divide at all; this form is usually
      associated with severe facial deformities. In semilobar HPE the hemispheres divide somewhat,
      causing an intermediate form of the disorder. In lobar HPE, the mildest form, separation of
      hemispheres is nearly normal.

      Patients with HPE and their direct blood relatives may participate in this study. Patients
      are seen by a team of medical specialists at the NIH Clinical Center for the following
      procedures:

        -  Physical and neurological examination

        -  Eye examination

        -  Imaging studies, such as echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, brain MRI

        -  Electroencephalogram (EEG)

        -  Hearing evaluation

        -  Blood and urine samples for genetic and endocrine studies, routine blood chemistries,
           urinalysis, and urine electrolytes

        -  Other consultations as needed

        -  Possibly photographs, including front and side views of the face and other body parts
           that may be involved in HPE, such as the eyes, teeth, hands, and feet

      Parents will be asked questions about the child's prenatal, birth, newborn, and past medical
      history, growth, behavior and development, and therapy and medication.

      Because HPE is a genetic disorder and gene changes can be passed on in a family, parents will
      also be asked to undergo the following procedures:

        -  Completion of a medical and family history form

        -  Physical and neurological examination

        -  Blood and urine samples (for mothers only)

        -  Specialty consultations as indicated

        -  Possibly photographs, including front and side views of the face and other body parts
           that may be involved in HPE, such as the eyes, teeth, hands, and feet

        -  Psychosocial study. Some parents will be asked to participate in a telephone interview
           or complete a questionnaire, or both, about their attitudes, beliefs, and concerns about
           how they and their family cope with their child's condition. Some questionnaires may
           include questions about aspects of their marriage and personal feelings and experiences.

      Parents will meet with a doctor and a genetics nurse to discuss the results of the tests and
      answer questions. Parents may be asked to bring their child back to the NIH after 2 years for
      follow-up examination and possible additional or repeat testing.

    <textblock>
      Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a defect of midline forebrain development that occurs soon after
      conception. It has a prevalence of 1 in 250 during early embryonic development, and 1 in
      10,000 to 1 in 20,000 at term. In live born infants, the abnormalities associated with HPE
      are divided into three main categories: alobar, semilobar, and lobar HPE. A fourth variant,
      middle interhemispheric variant, has also been recognized. The purpose of this study is to
      increase our understanding of the genetic and clinical manifestations of HPE through detailed
      physical, psychological, developmental, neurologic, endocrinologic, and radiologic studies.
      We will examine the spectrum of clinical characteristics of HPE to facilitate early diagnosis
      and clinical management, including genetic counseling. Finally, we plan to assess the
      psychosocial impact of HPE on the family as a unit. Most patients and their families will be
      seen at the NIH Clinical Center. A subset may be examined outside the NIH, and a further
      subset, for the psychosocial studies, may be interviewed by phone.

        Patients with known or suspected holoprosencephaly (HPE). To conserve resources and meet
        study objectives, subjects with known mutations will be given priority in selection for
        extensive clinical studies. Direct blood relatives (typically parents, and occasionally
        siblings of affected individuals) of patients with HPE are also eligible to participate.@@@

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Depending on their willingness to participate, subjects may enroll in DNA
                  laboratory-only (98-HG-0249), psychosocial-only, or clinical-only. However, to
                  conserve resources and meet study objectives, subjects with known mutations will
                  be given priority in selection for extensive clinical studies. All races and
                  genders are known to be at risk for HPE, anywhere in the world. Nationality or
                  place of origin is not specific barrier to participation.

               2. Direct blood relatives (typically parents, and occasionally siblings of affected
                  individuals) of patients with HPE are also eligible to participate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf
             of their children as minors) or assent.

          2. Medical condition(s) or mental retardation are not in themselves reason for exclusion
             if in the judgment of the referring physician this would involve no more than minimal
             risk. We anticipate that children with mental handicaps would be included in the
             research population. We will make every effort to explain the study for the purpose of
             assent in a manner that the family feels is both age and developmentally appropriate
             for that child.

          3. We generally review a brief clinical description from the referring physician about a
             potential research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into
             the study. We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not HPE or related
             to our direct research interests (e.g. HPE cases that are syndromic like Smith Lemli
             Opitz syndrome, Trisomy 13, Trisomy 18, drug-related, or teratogen-related). This
             almost never happens, and we would attempt to make referrals to a more appropriate
             investigator.

        It is our intention to try to remove as many economic, cultural, geographic, racial, and
        gender barriers as we reasonably can to promote participation of HPE cases for research
        purposes.

        Description and justification of clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria for environmental
        study arm control group (individuals with Williams syndrome) :

        Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of Williams syndrome caused by deletions in
        chromosome 7q11 involving the Williams-Beuren Syndrome Critical Region (WBSCR). Children
        should be less than 6 years of age to allow for improved maternal recall of prenatal

        environmental exposures. The Williams syndrome cohort (PI: Dr. Beth Kozel; National Heart
        Lung Blood Institute) was chosen to allow for inherent biases in mothers who have children
        with multiple anomaly syndromes.
