    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies the use of a human prostate tissue model to maintain and
      study prostate cancer stem cells. A human prostate tissue model uses leftover tissue that was
      removed during surgery from patients with non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate (benign
      prostatic hyperplasia) and may create an environment similar to the natural environment of
      the human body. Prostate cancer stem cells are cells that cause cancer to grow. Using real
      tissue to create an environment to study stem cells may help doctors learn more about how
      they work and how they respond to treatments.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To optimize a decellularized prostate tissue model for the maintenance of prostate cancer
      stem cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the self-renewal and differentiation ability of human prostate cancer stem
      cells (CSCs) (tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 [TROP2]+ cells) in the above
      mentioned decellularized prostate tissue model.

      II. To compare the number of CSCs according to key patient characteristics, including race,
      age, Gleason, metastasis status, and previous cancer treatment(s).

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are collected from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia for
      decellularization and preparation as human extracellular matrix for growing human prostate
      CSCs. Tissue samples are also collected from patients with prostate cancer for the analysis
      of TROP2+ cells by flow cytometry.
