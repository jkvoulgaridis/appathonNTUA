  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually, an estimated 700,000 patients do not complete their scheduled MRI scans because of
      claustrophobia or inability to hold still. Training staffs working in MRI facilities to
      provide Comfort Talk® will enable patients to complete high quality imaging without
      medication, which will increase satisfaction and comfort while reducing sedation risks for
      patients, and increase efficiency and reduce loss of revenue for facilities. The effect of
      such training will be tested at 12 MRI sites in a randomized design. Outcome data will be
      collected for one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Claustrophobia and disruptive patient motion are common impediments to MRI examination, but
      they may be prevented or ameliorated with a non-pharmacologic behavioral intervention
      administered by trained staff. The potential benefits of such an intervention are highly
      significant, considering that the alternatives are to cancel the study or administer
      sedation. Inability to complete their MRI scans adversely affects an estimated 700,000
      patients every year in the US. These patients are either deprived of a diagnosis, subject to
      diagnostic delays and interpretation errors due to motion artifact, or are exposed to risks
      of pharmacologic sedation, including death. The imaging facilities typically cannot fill the
      suddenly vacated examination slots in time before the next scheduled patient and incur
      considerable lost revenue and efficiency. A negative patient experience further jeopardizes
      Value-Based reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) towards
      which patient satisfaction counts 30%. The long term goal is to provide a validated,
      clinically feasible means for non-pharmacologic amelioration of claustrophobia and disruptive
      patient motion, achieved by training facility staff in Comfort Talk®.

      Comfort Talk® training consists of a proprietary, standardized R3 Process of Rapport,
      Relaxation, and Reframing including 2 x 8-hrs class-room interaction, onsite coaching, and
      institution-specific web-based support to help the MRI team to further develop its own
      language style and skill set.

      The effect of Comfort Talk® training will be quantified in a prospective randomized design at
      12 MRI satellites of the Ohio State University Medical Center and Duke University Medical
      Center. Return of investment of training will be based on a decision-analysis model with
      focus on number of scans performed, cancellations from no-shows and refusals; patients unable
      to start or complete a scan; and sedation rates in relation to capacity, cost, and
      reimbursement schedule. Patient satisfaction scores will be compared using Press Ganey
      national benchmark percentile rankings and CMS quality standards.

    <intervention_model_description>The original model was to have parallel randomized MRI sites. This was possible at one participating institution, The Ohio State Universty Medical Center (OSU). For the second institution (Duke University) staff cuts resulted in personnel cross-over between test and control sites making randomization impossible. Therefore a sequential model was used compared data from the pre- to post training period for the Duke sites. In total 12 MRI entities contributed, six at OSU, and six at Duke. Also, Duke and OSU turned out to have different modes of data collection. OSU had fully automated capture of patients scheduled, showing, and completing their examination as well as a priori numbers of available imaging slots per time unit. Duke did not collect these data electronically so that personnel could only gather the pertinent measures by daily manual diary entry. Thus the mode of result presentation is not concordant in some aspects among sites.</intervention_model_description>

          <description>Three MRI clinical sites form the experimental group at OSU in a randomized assignment. Their personnel was trained to use Comfort Talk® to help patients who are claustrophobic, anxious, and/or cannot lie still to complete their tests at the onset of the study.
Comfort Talk® Training: Personnel of MRI units will be trained in advanced rapport skills, patient-centered and hypnoidal language, correct use of suggestions and skills of tension diffusion. This will entail 16 hrs class room work, additional on-site post-training support, and access to a post-training support web module resulting in at least 20 hrs training.</description>

Comfort Talk® Training: Personnel of MRI units will be trained in advanced rapport skills, patient-centered and hypnoidal language, correct use of suggestions and skills of tension diffusion. This will entail 16 hrs class room work, additional on-site post-training support, and access to a post-training support web module resulting in at least 20 hrs training.</description>

        <description>Quarterly percentile rankings of patients' &quot;Overall Assesment&quot; of their satisfaction on a national clinical survey instrument (Press Ganey).

Comfort Talk® Training: Personnel of MRI units will be trained in advanced rapport skills, patient-centered and hypnoidal language, correct use of suggestions and skills of tension diffusion. This will entail 16 hrs class room work, additional on-site post-training support, and access to a post-training support web module resulting in at least 20 hrs training.</description>

      <desc>Adverse events were monitored during the training days of the MRI teams. Then assessment was non-systematic in that we would have reported adverse events if they had become known or being collected after training. Patients at risk were only those in the post-training period who showed up at the facility including those who completed their scans and also those who did not.
Number of deaths was not specifically monitored.</desc>

          <title>Comfort Talk® Training (OSU)</title>
          <description>Three MRI clinical sites form the experimental group. Their personnel was trained to use Comfort Talk® to help patients who are claustrophobic, anxious, and/or cannot lie still to complete their tests at the onset of the study.
Comfort Talk® Training: Personnel of MRI units will be trained in advanced rapport skills, patient-centered and hypnoidal language, correct use of suggestions and skills of tension diffusion. This will entail 16 hrs classroom work, additional on-site post-training support, and access to a post-training support web module resulting in at least 20 hrs training.</description>

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Because of considerable staff cuts at Duke right personnel rotated among all sites so that randomization based on training could not be maintained. Therefore a pre/post training comparison was done. OSU collected data electronically, Duke by diary.</limitations_and_caveats>
