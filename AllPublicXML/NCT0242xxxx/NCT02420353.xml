  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are among the most frequent traumatic knee injuries
      that occur in physically active individuals. Despite advances in minimally invasive surgical
      reconstruction techniques and aggressive rehabilitation, this atrophy and loss of strength
      can persist even after patients return to full activity and can place them at considerable
      risk for re-injury and developing osteoarthritis (OA). The design of new therapeutic
      interventions to prevent muscle atrophy is needed to advance the care of patients who suffer
      from ACL injuries. The growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis plays an
      important role in promoting muscle growth and protecting muscle from atrophy. While GH
      therapy has shown promise in protecting immobilized muscle from various models of disuse
      atrophy, it remains unknown whether GH can help to restore strength and protect against the
      loss in strength that occurs after ACL tear. GH therapy may help to accelerate the safe
      return to play of patients that suffer ACL tears, and help to prevent the long-term OA and
      reduction in quality of life that occur after these traumatic knee injuries.

    <measure>Normative Isokinetic Knee Extension Strength, Measured in Newton Meters (Nm) at 26 Weeks Post-op</measure>
    <time_frame>at 26 wks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic knee flexion and extension strength measurements were obtained in a System 3 dynamometer (BioDex, Shirley, New York). Isokinetic measurements were performed at a speed of 60º/sec from a range of 0º to 90º of knee flexion. Normalized values were calculated by dividing the value from the injured limb by the value from the contralateral, uninjured leg prior to surgery. For each measurement, the highest force from a series of 5 repetitions was used.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males between the ages of 18 and 35

          -  Have acute unilateral complete ACL tears with or without bucket handle medial meniscus
             tears that occurred within the past 6 months

          -  Consent to undergo an ACL reconstruction by an orthopaedic surgeon using a patellar
             tendon or hamstring autograft

          -  Will be performing supervised post-operative rehabilitation at UMHS MedSport at
             Dominos Farms

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are undergoing a revision ACL reconstruction

          -  Had a previous injury to the involved knee

          -  Have an allergy to recombinant GH

          -  Have a BMI&lt;20 or &gt;35

          -  Have a growth disorder of bones or connective tissue, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2
             diabetes mellitus, or who have a history of carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger,
             myopathy, cancer, endocrine disorder, hypertension or rheumatologic disorder.

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;140mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90mm Hg, or with
             resting heart rate &gt;110 BPM or &lt;40 BPM at screening.

          -  Additionally, because GH is currently listed as a banned substance by the World
             Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and most
             professional sports agencies, we will exclude patients who are current collegiate,
             professional or elite athletes.

        <title>Normative Isokinetic Knee Extension Strength, Measured in Newton Meters (Nm) at 26 Weeks Post-op</title>
        <description>Isokinetic knee flexion and extension strength measurements were obtained in a System 3 dynamometer (BioDex, Shirley, New York). Isokinetic measurements were performed at a speed of 60º/sec from a range of 0º to 90º of knee flexion. Normalized values were calculated by dividing the value from the injured limb by the value from the contralateral, uninjured leg prior to surgery. For each measurement, the highest force from a series of 5 repetitions was used.</description>

        <description>Isometric knee flexion and extension strength measurements were obtained in a System 3 dynamometer (BioDex, Shirley, New York). Isometric measurements were performed at 45º of knee flexion. Normalized values were calculated by dividing the value from the injured limb by the value from the contralateral, uninjured leg prior to surgery. For each measurement, the highest force from a series of 5 repetitions was used.</description>

        <title>Absolute Isokinetic Extension (Nm) at 26 wk Post-op</title>
        <description>Absolute Isokinetic knee flexion and extension strength measurements were obtained in a System 3 dynamometer (BioDex, Shirley, New York). Isokinetic measurements were performed at a speed of 60º/sec from a range of 0º to 90º of knee flexion. Strength values were calculated by comparing the affected limb of each subject across study group. For each measurement, the highest force from a series of 5 repetitions was used.</description>

        <population>A total of 19 participants were analyzed for bilateral isokinetic knee strength using the BioDex system 3 results where recorded in newton meters (Nm), results where then compared between study groups.</population>

          <description>Absolute Isometric knee flexion and extension strength measurements were obtained in a System 3 dynamometer (BioDex, Shirley, New York). Isometric measurements were performed at 45º of knee flexion. Strength values were calculated by comparing the affected limb of each subject across study group. For each measurement, the highest force from a series of 5 repetitions was used.</description>
          <population>A total of 19 participants were analyzed for bilateral isometric knee strength using the BioDex system 3 results where recorded in newton meters (Nm), results where then compared between study groups.</population>

PCS and MCS summary scores are standardized using a t-score transformation and normalized to the U.S. population of a score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher PCS and MCS scores indicate better health. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) collected between 2000 and 2002 standard norms range as followed PCS maximum: 72.11; minimum: 0.59.</description>

An aggregate total score is not calculated since it is regarded desirable to analyze and interpret the five dimensions separately.

        <title>KOOS Patient Reported Outcome Measure: ADL at Pre-op (Baseline)</title>
        <description>KOOS Function in daily living (ADL) (17 items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. An aggregate total score is not calculated since it is regarded desirable to analyze and interpret the five dimensions separately.
Maximum score 100% / Minimum score 0%. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as is common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures</description>

Patients will begin GH treatment one week prior to surgery and will continue through 5 weeks after surgery. On the day of surgery, patients will not take GH, but otherwise patients will take GH every day over this 6 week period.</description>

An aggregate total score is not calculated since it is regarded desirable to analyze and interpret the five dimensions separately.
Maximum score 100% / Minimum score 0%. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as is common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures</description>
