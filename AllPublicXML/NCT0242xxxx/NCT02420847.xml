      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ixazomib citrate, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, and doxorubicin hydrochloride when given together in treating patients with
      urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be
      removed by surgery. Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving ixazomib citrate together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and doxorubicin hydrochloride
      may be a better treatment for urothelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Find maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for the combination therapy of ixazomib (ixazomib
      citrate) and gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride)/doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride)
      (i.e. dose pairs of ixazomib and gemcitabine/doxorubicin that have an acceptable target
      toxicity rate of 30%). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the dose-limiting toxicities of the dose pairs found. II. Choose a dose pair for
      phase II expansion in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      III. Determine the objective response rate and median survival for patients treated on the
      phase II expansion.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO), gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

          -  All patients must have histologic demonstration of metastatic or locally unresectable
             transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium; variant histology is allowed as long as
             there is an urothelial component present; the principal investigator (PI), will serve
             as the final arbiter of eligibility

          -  All patients must have measurable or evaluable disease; in general, liver and lung
             lesions should be at least 1 cm, and patients with node-only disease should have
             lesions of &gt;= 1.5 cm in greatest dimension; patients with disease confined to bone may
             be eligible if a measurable lytic defect is present or a serum marker is elevated (&gt; 4
             x upper limit of normal [ULN]); the principal investigator is the final arbiter in
             questions related to measurability; patients with a three-dimensional mass or pelvic
             sidewall fixation on bladder examination under anesthesia are considered to have
             measurable disease

          -  Patients must have had at least one prior therapy to be eligible for either phase I or
             II, unless they are either not candidates for or refuse cisplatin-based therapy

          -  Phase I: patients are eligible with any number of prior regimens regardless of what
             those regimens contained (i.e. prior bortezomib or combination gemcitabine and
             adriamycin is acceptable)

          -  Phase II: patients are eligible if their previous chemotherapy regimen did not contain
             bortezomib, carfilzomib, or other known proteasome inhibitor or a combination of
             gemcitabine &gt;= 800 mg/m^2 plus adriamycin &gt;= 30 mg/m^2; patients who receive
             sequential or alternating therapy as part of front-line treatment will be counted as
             having one prior regimen; patients who have failed prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy will
             be eligible for this trial

          -  If prior history of ischemic heart disease or exposure to 200 mg/m^2 of doxorubicin,
             patients must have a measured ejection fraction (either by multigated acquisition scan

                  form through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,

                       treatment period and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

                    -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred
                       and usual lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar,
                       ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not
                       acceptable methods of contraception)

          -  Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
