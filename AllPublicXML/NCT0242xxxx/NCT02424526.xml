  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find the optimal dosage of home-based treadmill training needed to
      accelerate walking onset and to examine the long-term effects on the child's walking
      activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill
      training by comparing high-intensity (5 days/week, twice daily for 10-20 min for 6 weeks) to
      low-intensity (2 days/week, once daily for 10-20 minutes for 6 weeks) treadmill training; and
      to compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking attainment
      and overall walking activity in young children with cerebral palsy.

      Hypotheses

        -  A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase walking onset in young
           children with CP.

        -  A more intensive protocol of treadmill training will increase overall walking activity
           in young children with CP.

      Specific Aims

        -  To determine optimal parameters for dosing home-based treadmill training by comparing
           high-intensity to low-intensity home-based treadmill training.

        -  To compare the effects of high- versus low-intensity treadmill training on walking onset
           and overall walking activity.

      Study design •Prospective randomized controlled trial

      Study population

      •Two groups of 12 children with CP under the age of 3 years and are not walking yet will
      receive either home-based high-intensity treadmill training or low-intensity treadmill
      training. The children will be assessed before, immediately after, at 1-month and at 4-months
      following the intervention via standardized outcome measures.

    <measure>Gross Motor Function Measure Dimension E</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at 6 weeks, 1 month, 4 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure is a criterion-referenced test of gross motor function for children with cerebral palsy ages 5 months to 15 years. It contains 5 Dimensions (A-E). Dimension E is related to the child's gross motor skills related to walking, running and jumping and is assessed by observation. Dimension E contains 24 gross motor skills. Each of these motor skills is rated either 0 (does not initiate), 1(initiates), 2 (partially completes), 3 (completes) or NT( not tested). The total possible Dimension E score is 72 with a range of 0-72. Scores can be converted into a percent score by dividing the child's achieved points by the number of possible points. Higher scores and a higher percentage indicate better performance in walking, running and jumping. Change from baseline in total points, not in percentage, is reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking Activity Measured by StepWatch</measure>
    <time_frame>StepWatch data was collected for all awake daytime hours over a 7 day period at study onset before treadmill training commences and at 6 weeks, 1 month, 4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>StepWatch data records the child's walking activity in minutes/day. It is collected via an accelerometer attached to the distal leg and worn at all waking hours except during sleep and bath time.Higher numbers of active minutes indicate higher level of activity. Changes from baseline are reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function Measure Dimension D</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at 6 weeks, 1 month, 4 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure is a criterion-referenced test of gross motor function for children with cerebral palsy ages 5 months to 15 years. It contains 5 Dimensions (A-E).Dimension D is a test of gross motor function related to standing ability. The child's gross motor skills related to standing are assessed by observation. The test contains 13 gross motor skills. Each of these motor skills is rated either 0 (does not initiate), 1(initiates), 2 (partially completes), 3 (completes) or NT( not tested). The total possible Dimension D score is 39 with a range of 0-39. Scores can be converted into a percent score by dividing the child's achieved points by the number of possible points. Higher scores and a higher percentage indicate better performance in standing. Change from baseline in total points, not in percentage, is reported.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Index-Mobility Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, at 6 weeks, at 1-month and at 4-months following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Index is a valid and reliable tool that provides an assessment of a child's functional status and performance via observation and parent report.The Mobility Subscale examines the child's functional skills related to movement. There are a total of 13 motor categories on the Mobility Subscale, with 5 possible motor skills in each category, for a total of 65 distinct motor skills. Skills are marked as 0 (not observed) or 1 (observed) and added.There are a total of 65 possible points with a range of 0-65 points on the Mobility Subscale. Higher scores indicate greater function.Scores are reported as changes from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 -Locomotion Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at 6 weeks, at 1-month and at 4-months</time_frame>
    <description>Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 is a norm-referenced standardized test of gross and fine motor performance for children from birth through age 5.The Locomotion Subscale examines the ability of the child to move through space. It contains a total of 89 motor skills. The child is rated on each skill on a scale of 0 (unable), 1 (partial) or 2 (complete) and the scores are added for a total possible raw score of 178 and a range of 0-178. Higher raw scores indicate a better outcome.The raw scores can be converted to standard scores, age equivalents and percentiles Raw scores of the Locomotion subscale are reported based on changes from baseline.</description>

        <title>Gross Motor Function Measure Dimension E</title>
        <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure is a criterion-referenced test of gross motor function for children with cerebral palsy ages 5 months to 15 years. It contains 5 Dimensions (A-E). Dimension E is related to the child's gross motor skills related to walking, running and jumping and is assessed by observation. Dimension E contains 24 gross motor skills. Each of these motor skills is rated either 0 (does not initiate), 1(initiates), 2 (partially completes), 3 (completes) or NT( not tested). The total possible Dimension E score is 72 with a range of 0-72. Scores can be converted into a percent score by dividing the child's achieved points by the number of possible points. Higher scores and a higher percentage indicate better performance in walking, running and jumping. Change from baseline in total points, not in percentage, is reported.</description>

Skills are marked as 0 (not observed) or 1 (observed) and added.There are a total of 65 possible points with a range of 0-65 points on the Mobility Subscale. Higher scores indicate greater function.Scores are reported as changes from baseline.</description>

        <description>Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 is a norm-referenced standardized test of gross and fine motor performance for children from birth through age 5.The Locomotion Subscale examines the ability of the child to move through space. It contains a total of 89 motor skills. The child is rated on each skill on a scale of 0 (unable), 1 (partial) or 2 (complete) and the scores are added for a total possible raw score of 178 and a range of 0-178. Higher raw scores indicate a better outcome.The raw scores can be converted to standard scores, age equivalents and percentiles Raw scores of the Locomotion subscale are reported based on changes from baseline.</description>
