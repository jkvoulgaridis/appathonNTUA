      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given together
      with vorinostat and with or without radiation therapy in treating younger patients with newly
      diagnosed or progressive diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a tumor that arises from the
      middle portion of the brain stem. Vorinostat and temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving temsirolimus and vorinostat with
      or without radiation therapy may be a better treatment for younger patients with diffuse
      intrinsic pontine glioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose of temsirolimus
      in combination with vorinostat given every four weeks in patients with diffuse intrinsic
      pontine glioma (DIPG).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of the combination vorinostat and temsirolimus
      administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the antitumor activity of the combination of vorinostat and temsirolimus within
      the confines of a phase 1 study.

      II. To assess the biologic effects of vorinostat and temsirolimus on the signaling pathways
      of interest in these tumors.

      III. To evaluate response with advanced neuroimaging (including magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy) and correlate with fiber tract changes using tractography and fractional
      anisotropy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY PHASE: Patients receive vorinostat once daily (QD) and undergo radiation
      therapy QD for 30 fractions over 6-7 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Four to six weeks after the completion of radiation therapy, patients
      receive vorinostat PO QD and temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1-8.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 10 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive vorinostat PO QD and temsirolimus IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1-8.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
