  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 different doses of
      intravenous and oral Debio 1450 compared with intravenous vancomycin and oral linezolid in
      the treatment of patients with staphylococcal ABSSSI.

    <time_frame>At 48 to 72 hours from randomization (Day 4)</time_frame>
    <description>ECRR was defined as the percentage of responders to treatment at 48 to 72 hours from randomization. Responders were the participants who showed greater than or equal to (≥) 20% reduction in area of the primary lesion involving erythema, edema, or induration of the primary ABSSSI lesion (as assessed by the ruler method) at 48 to 72 hours compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Success Rate: Percentage of Participants Assessed by the Investigator as Responders at 48 to 72 Hours From Randomization, at End of Treatment (EOT) and Short-term Follow-up (STFU)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 to 72 hours after randomization (Day 4), EOT (Day 12) and STFU (Day 19)</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator Assessment of Clinical Outcome (IACO) of treatment was assessed for each participant as success or failure at 48 to 72 hours after randomization at EOT and STFU visits. Clinical success was resolution or near resolution of most disease-specific signs and symptoms and no new signs, symptoms, or complications attributable to ABSSSI such that no further antibiotic therapy is required for treatment of original site of infection. Clinical failure was requirement for additional antibiotic therapy for treatment of the original site of infection or incision and drainage of ABSSSI site that was not both anticipated and completed within a 48- to 72-hour window following randomization, or unplanned major surgical intervention required due to failure of study medication or development of osteomyelitis after baseline. Participants who met both success criteria and none of failure criteria were considered as a clinical success for IACO.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Success Rate: Percentage of Participants Assessed by the Sponsor as Responders After 7 to 10 Days of Treatment at EOT and STFU</measure>
    <time_frame>EOT (Day 12) and STFU (Day 19)</time_frame>
    <description>The Sponsor's Assessment of Clinical Outcome was obtained at EOT and STFU visits based on IACO and additional criteria. Sponsor assessed participants as clinical failure if they required non-study or rescue antibiotics due to lack of efficacy after at least 48 hours from randomization or experienced drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuation of study medication for drug-related AEs or required antibiotic therapy for longer than 10 days or had the need for unplanned surgical intervention &gt;48 hours after randomization. As per IACO, clinical success was resolution or near resolution of most disease-specific signs and symptoms and no new signs, symptoms or complications. Clinical failure was requirement for additional antibiotic therapy or incision and drainage of ABSSSI site or unplanned major surgical intervention or development of osteomyelitis.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Composite Assessment of Clinical Outcome (CACO) of Success</measure>
    <time_frame>48 to 72 hours after randomization (Day 4) and STFU (Day 19)</time_frame>
    <description>CACO of treatment was determined as a combined outcome of early response to treatment (at 48 to 72 hours from randomization) and IACO at the STFU visit. Participants had a CACO of success if they met both of the following criteria: An early response to treatment (at 48 to 72 hours from randomization) (ECR = responder) and a clinical outcome of success at the STFU visit (7 to 14 days after EOT) based on IACO (IACO = success).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Showed Microbiological Evidence of Cure 48 to 72 Hours From Randomization, EOT, and STFU</measure>
    <time_frame>48 to 72 hours after randomization (Day 4), EOT (Day 12) and STFU (Day 19)</time_frame>
    <description>The microbiological outcome was assessed by the sponsor at 48 to 72 hours from randomization, EOT and STFU. It was based on blood and skin lesion identification results from baseline samples and skin lesion identification results from baseline samples and skin lesion identification results from follow-up samples as well as on, molecular typing results, and the IACO. Microbiological eradication rate was defined as proportion of participants with 'Documented Eradication' (absence of baseline pathogen(s) in follow-up cultures of the original site of infection.) or 'Presumed Eradication' (no material available for culture and an IACO of 'Success') in relation to the total number of participants in the respective treatment group.</description>

        <title>Clinical Success Rate: Percentage of Participants Assessed by the Investigator as Responders at 48 to 72 Hours From Randomization, at End of Treatment (EOT) and Short-term Follow-up (STFU)</title>
        <description>The Investigator Assessment of Clinical Outcome (IACO) of treatment was assessed for each participant as success or failure at 48 to 72 hours after randomization at EOT and STFU visits. Clinical success was resolution or near resolution of most disease-specific signs and symptoms and no new signs, symptoms, or complications attributable to ABSSSI such that no further antibiotic therapy is required for treatment of original site of infection. Clinical failure was requirement for additional antibiotic therapy for treatment of the original site of infection or incision and drainage of ABSSSI site that was not both anticipated and completed within a 48- to 72-hour window following randomization, or unplanned major surgical intervention required due to failure of study medication or development of osteomyelitis after baseline. Participants who met both success criteria and none of failure criteria were considered as a clinical success for IACO.</description>

        <title>Clinical Success Rate: Percentage of Participants Assessed by the Sponsor as Responders After 7 to 10 Days of Treatment at EOT and STFU</title>
        <description>The Sponsor's Assessment of Clinical Outcome was obtained at EOT and STFU visits based on IACO and additional criteria. Sponsor assessed participants as clinical failure if they required non-study or rescue antibiotics due to lack of efficacy after at least 48 hours from randomization or experienced drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuation of study medication for drug-related AEs or required antibiotic therapy for longer than 10 days or had the need for unplanned surgical intervention &gt;48 hours after randomization. As per IACO, clinical success was resolution or near resolution of most disease-specific signs and symptoms and no new signs, symptoms or complications. Clinical failure was requirement for additional antibiotic therapy or incision and drainage of ABSSSI site or unplanned major surgical intervention or development of osteomyelitis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Showed Microbiological Evidence of Cure 48 to 72 Hours From Randomization, EOT, and STFU</title>
        <description>The microbiological outcome was assessed by the sponsor at 48 to 72 hours from randomization, EOT and STFU. It was based on blood and skin lesion identification results from baseline samples and skin lesion identification results from baseline samples and skin lesion identification results from follow-up samples as well as on, molecular typing results, and the IACO. Microbiological eradication rate was defined as proportion of participants with 'Documented Eradication' (absence of baseline pathogen(s) in follow-up cultures of the original site of infection.) or 'Presumed Eradication' (no material available for culture and an IACO of 'Success') in relation to the total number of participants in the respective treatment group.</description>
