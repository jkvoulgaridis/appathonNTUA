      Pediatric research in the management of nausea has been limited by the absence of a reliable
      method to quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analog
      scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, but this has not been shown to be reliable in young
      children. By default the most common objective outcome measure used in pediatric studies has
      been the incidence and number of emetic episodes. This measure, however, correlates poorly
      with the somatic subjective symptom of nausea.

      Pediatric research in the management of nausea has been limited by the absence of a reliable
      method to quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analog
      scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, but this has not been shown to be reliable in young
      children. By default the most common objective outcome measure used in pediatric studies has
      been the incidence and number of emetic episodes. This measure, however, correlates poorly
      with the somatic subjective symptom of nausea.

      Apfel et al have shown that 30-40% of adult patients undergoing surgery have post discharge
      nausea and / or vomiting while 12% have vomiting. These data on nausea in adults were based
      on a visual analog scale for nausea. There are no data on the incidence of postoperative
      nausea in children since the severity of symptoms are difficult to measure as younger
      children are known to be unable to use the VAS reliably.

      Recently a pictorial scale for measuring nausea, the Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF)
      scale, has been developed and shown to have construct, content and convergent validity as an
      instrument to measure nausea in children. The clinical usefulness of this scale in
      determining the incidence of postoperative and post-discharge nausea in children has yet to
      be determined including the lowest age where it can be used reliably, the score associated
      with a patient's perception of a need for treatment, the minimum change in the scores of
      clinical relevance and the test-retest reliability when nausea is rated as not having
      changed.

    <description>To measure pain and nausea, subjects completed the VAS and two pictorial scales (Faces Pain Scale-Revised for pain and BARF for nausea). The VAS uses a horizontal 10cm line with the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. The subject marks on the line their pain rating. Higher points indicate more severe or intense pain. FACES scale has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more pain). The BARF scales has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more nausea).</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Post-Discharge Nausea, Emesis, Severe Nausea, Severe Emesis and Number Receiving Rescue Antiemetics in Subjects Who Returned the Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>First 24 postoperative hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were discharged from the PACU when they achieved institutional discharge criteria. The parents were given a diary to record the maximum nausea on the VAS and BARF scales during the first 24 postoperative hours. Each child's caretaker was contacted by phone 24 hours after surgery to determine whether the child had any nausea or vomiting and which medications were given after discharge. The VAS uses a horizontal 10cm line with the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. The subject marks on the line their pain rating. Higher points indicate more severe or intense pain. FACES scale has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more pain). The BARF scales has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more nausea).</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With Nausea, Emesis, Severe Nausea, Severe Emesis and Number Receiving Rescue Antiemetics in the Post-Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU)</title>
        <description>To measure pain and nausea, subjects completed the VAS and two pictorial scales (Faces Pain Scale-Revised for pain and BARF for nausea). The VAS uses a horizontal 10cm line with the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. The subject marks on the line their pain rating. Higher points indicate more severe or intense pain. FACES scale has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more pain). The BARF scales has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more nausea).</description>
        <time_frame>When awake and responding to commands in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
        <population>Patients with severe nausea were included in the number with any nausea. Patients with severe emesis were included in the number with any emesis. Because some patients had both nausea and vomiting, the sum of the number with nausea and the number with emesis will not equal those with either nausea or emesis.</population>

        <title>Incidence of Post-Discharge Nausea, Emesis, Severe Nausea, Severe Emesis and Number Receiving Rescue Antiemetics in Subjects Who Returned the Diary</title>
        <description>Patients were discharged from the PACU when they achieved institutional discharge criteria. The parents were given a diary to record the maximum nausea on the VAS and BARF scales during the first 24 postoperative hours. Each child's caretaker was contacted by phone 24 hours after surgery to determine whether the child had any nausea or vomiting and which medications were given after discharge. The VAS uses a horizontal 10cm line with the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. The subject marks on the line their pain rating. Higher points indicate more severe or intense pain. FACES scale has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more pain). The BARF scales has 6 faces with assigned scores ranging from 0 to 10 with a score difference of 2 between each face (a higher score indicates more nausea).</description>
