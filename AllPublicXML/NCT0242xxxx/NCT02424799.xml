    <textblock>
      This First Time in Human (FTIH) study, which will be performed in three parts, is designed to
      investigate the safety, local tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after
      single and repeat topical applications of up to 2 strengths of GSK2646264 and corresponding
      placebo within the same subject, in healthy adult subjects (Part A), subjects with cold
      urticaria (CU, Part B) and subjects with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CsU, Part C). The
      study will also measure short term effects of GSK2646264 on the number and size of weals in
      subjects with CsU, and in healthy subjects and subjects with CU following provocation tests.

          -  All subjects must be free from scarring or skin markings (e.g. tattoos or piercings)
             and open wounds (e.g. scarring or skin markings) on the defined areas of the body that
             cream will be applied onto, unless in the opinion of the investigator it will not
             compromise the subjects safety and quality of data.

          -  Able to refrain from exposure to extended and direct sunlight during the study period,
             from screening (SCR) until follow up, especially the area that is under treatment

             the contraception methods listed in protocol. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until the follow up visit or a time period
             that is 5 terminal half-live post-last dose which will be determined following Part A
             of the study.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Willing, committed and able
             to return for all clinic visits and complete all study-related procedures. Able to
             read, understand and complete study- related questionnaires.

        Inclusion criteria specific for healthy subjects (Part A)

          -  The subject is aged between 18 and 55 yrs of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 to 30 kg
             per square meter (m^2 )(inclusive).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator, in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor (MM) if required, agrees
             and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Demonstration of a positive weal and flare reaction (&gt;=3 millimeter (mm) in diameter
             relative to negative control) to at least one allergen from a battery of allergens
             (mixed grass pollen, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch pollen and cat dander) on
             skin prick testing at SCR.

          -  Subjects must be free from any past or present benign or malignant skin conditions and
             disease, unless in the opinion of the investigator it will not compromise the
             subject's safety and quality of data.

          -  Non-smokers or if the subject is a tobacco smoke: smokes less than 5 cigarettes per
             day and commits to not smoke tobacco for the duration of the in-house stay, and
             commits to stable and moderate use (as determined by the Investigator) of tobacco or
             nicotine-containing products, including nicotine patches/gum, during the course of the
             study, as long as the patches do not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 milli
             international unit [MlU]/milliliter [mL] and estradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147
             picomoles/litre) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods described if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study

        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. AE and SAE were categorized as mild=an event that was easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities, moderate=an event that was sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities and severe=an event that prevented normal everyday activities.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Sign SBP and DBP for Part C</title>
        <description>Vital signs SBP and DBP were measured in the semi-supine position after 10 minutes of rest. Assessments were performed at Day 4 (pre-dose), Day 7 (pre-dose), Day 10, Day 15 and follow-up. Baseline was defined as assessments performed at Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. NA indicates standard deviation could not be calculated as a single participant was analyzed.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were obtained at screening and during the study single ECGs were taken. At each time point during the study ECG was taken using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measured the PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT (QTc-Bazett [QTcB], QTC interval-Fredericia [QTcF]) intervals, RR interval and uncorrected QT interval. Baseline was defined as assessment performed at Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters for Part A</title>
        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were obtained at screening and during the study single ECGs were taken. At each time point during the study ECG was taken using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measured the PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT (QTc-Bazett [QTcB], QTC interval-Fredericia[QTcF]) intervals, RR interval and uncorrected QT interval. Baseline was defined as assessment performed at Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

On Day 1 and Day 2, participants received treatment to 0.2% BSA; active treatment on one arm. In addition, participants received treatment to another 5% BSA; active to one side of the torso. On Days 3 and 4, the same treatment to the arms was applied as on Days 1 and 2, but the %BSA of the torso to which treatment was applied to was increased to 10%.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameters for Part C</title>
        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECGs were obtained at screening and during the study single ECGs were taken. At each time point during the study ECG was taken using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measured the PR interval, QRS duration, QTcB, QTcF intervals, RR interval and uncorrected QT interval. Baseline was defined as assessment performed at Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value. NA indicates standard deviation could not be calculated as a single participant was analyzed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Tolerability Assessment for Part A</title>
        <description>Tolerability was assessed with the skin irritation scoring system of study, where the score consists of a numeric score according to the dermal response scoring as follows 0=no evidence of irritation, 1=minimal erythema, barely perceptible (pink), 2=moderate erythema (definite redness), 3=strong erythema (intense redness), 4=definite edema, 5=erythema, edema, and papules, 6=vesicular eruption, 7=strong reaction spreading beyond test site, and a letter according to the other effects scoring, Z=no other effect, A=slight glazed appearance, B=marked glazing, C=glazing with peeling and cracking, F=glazing with fissures, G=film of dried serous exudate covering all or part of the patch site, H=small petechial erosions and/or scabs. For each skin assessment, letter grade will be converted to numeric values as below: A=0, Z=0, B=1, C=2, F=3, G=3, H=3. A combined score for each participant was calculated by adding all numeric and letter scores. A maximum score of 3 was allowed.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Tolerability Assessment for Part C</title>
          <description>Tolerability was assessed with the skin irritation scoring system of study, where the score consists of a numeric score according to the dermal response scoring as follows 0=no evidence of irritation, 1=minimal erythema, barely perceptible (pink), 2=moderate erythema (definite redness), 3=strong erythema (intense redness), 4=definite edema, 5=erythema, edema, and papules, 6=vesicular eruption, 7=strong reaction spreading beyond test site, and a letter according to the other effects scoring, Z=no other effect, A=slight glazed appearance, B=marked glazing, C=glazing with peeling and cracking, F=glazing with fissures, G=film of dried serous exudate covering all or part of the patch site, H=small petechial erosions and/or scabs. For each skin assessment, letter grade will be converted to numeric values as below: A=0, Z=0, B=1, C=2, F=3, G=3, H=3. A combined score for each participant was calculated by adding all numeric and letter scores. A maximum score of 3 was allowed.</description>
