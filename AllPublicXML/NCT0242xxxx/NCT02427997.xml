  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized controlled single-blind trial will test the hypotheses that a 6-
      week intervention that combines treadmill training (TT) with virtual reality (VR)
      significantly improves real-life, functional mobility and cognitive abilities, keys to
      health-related quality of life in patients with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single blinded,randomized controlled trial with 6 month follow-up will be
      employed to investigate the effects of treadmill training augmented with virtual reality on
      patients with MS. The study will include 200 participants. Participants will be randomized to
      either the intervention or active comparator. The intervention group will receive 18 sessions
      of Treadmill Training with Virtual Reality (TT+VR) and the active control comparison will
      receive 18 training sessions of treadmill training alone (TT) without the VR simulation All
      interventions will be delivered by therapists trained in the standard protocols. All subjects
      will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45
      minutes.Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive challenges,
      individualized to the participant's level of performance.

    <measure>Immediate change in gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>One week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed will be assessed under usual and dual task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles, using a sensorized 7 meter carpet (PKMAS) and wearable body fixed sensors. These measures will be compared to baseline performance</description>

    <measure>Number of correct answers in the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>One week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SDMT measures sustained attention and cognitive processing speed, is responsive to change and intervention in MS, can be administered in a relatively short period of time (&lt; 5 minutes), is largely resistant to practice effects, is valid and reliable in MS, and has been used in many clinical trials in MS. The SDMT involves matching numbers to corresponding symbols for 90 seconds and is a main component of the brief international cognitive assessment for MS (BICAMS). The number of correctly matched symbols is considered the outcome score. This test measures attention and visual spatial processing, and it is likely that the SDMT will change in response to the TT+VR, and not in response to TT. Indeed, SDMT has been associated with cognitive motor interference in patients with MS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 25 feet walk test (25FWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>One week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The T25-FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. It is the first component of the MSFC to be administered at each visit. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task.</description>

    <description>The TT+VR patients (i.e., the experimental arm) will receive 18 sessions (3 times per week x 6 weeks) of training that will consist of walking on a treadmill while wearing a safety harness (without body weight support, recall Figure 1), and while being provided with feedback from the system.</description>

    <description>VR is defined in general as a &quot;high-end-computer interface that involves real time simulation and interactions through multiple sensorial channels&quot;. The VR system to be used requires subjects to negotiate virtual obstacles while walking on a treadmill, in a safe environment. This dual task activity has large cognitive components such as information processing, planning, and attention while allowing for training in a more stimulating and enriching environment that includes both cognitive and motor components.</description>
