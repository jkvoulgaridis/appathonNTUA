  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the KAROS study is to compare rehabilitation outcomes between 3 proposed
      protocols and a current standard of care protocol for the purpose of identifying better
      practice for outpatient rehabilitation among patients with single total knee replacement. The
      3 advanced protocols involve use of an anti-gravity treadmill and/or the patterned electrical
      neuromuscular stimulation (PENS). Both medical modalities have been cleared by the FDA to be
      used in medical rehabilitation, including total knee replacement.

    <measure>AM-PAC (Activity Measure for Post Acute Care) Basic Mobility score: Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the AM-PAC Basic Mobility score. AM-PAC is a patient-reported instrument to measure functional level in 3 domains: basic mobility, daily activity, and applied cognition. For the purpose of the study, only the basic mobility domain was measured. Using item-response theory, the AM-PAC program selects the most representative questions from its extensive item bank to ask when measuring a patient's functional level. This study used the AM-PAC basic mobility paper short form designed for outpatient settings. The short-form consists of 18 questions and produces a raw score (18 to 72) transformed into a score ranging from 29.41 to 80.30 based on item-degree of difficulty. Higher transformed scores denote higher functional mobility: 34 - 51.9 = limited indoor mobility; 52 - 65.9 = enhanced indoor mobility; 66 and above = outdoor mobility.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in Arm 1 receive standard of care rehabilitation protocol using a recumbent or Nu-step bike during warm-up, followed by individualized therapeutic exercise, and cool-down protocols. The warm-up phase in the study refers to therapeutic exercise. The therapeutic exercise aims to condition and prepare patients for subsequent functional or therapeutic activities. The active comparator (Arm 1) is to ask participants to use modalities, such as a recumbent bike or a Nu-step bike during the warm-up phase of an outpatient physical therapy following a single total knee replacement.</description>

    <description>The intervention is to ask study participants to ambulate using an anti-gravity treadmill that integrates patented, NASA Differential Air Pressure (DAP) technology -- a precise air calibration system -- to uniformly reduce gravitational load and body weight during the warm-up phase of an outpatient physical therapy following a single total knee replacement.</description>
