    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate if a treatment the investigators call iCOMMIT is effective
      at helping smokers with schizophrenia stop smoking. iCOMMIT is a smoking cessation treatment
      that combines mobile technology with behavioral strategies, counseling, and medications.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of
      Multi-Component Mobile-enhanced Treatment for Smoking Cessation (iCOMMIT) in helping
      individuals with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders stop smoking. Eligible
      participants will be randomized to receive iCOMMIT, which includes smoking cessation
      counseling, pharmacotherapy, and mobile technology components, or a control intervention that
      includes smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy, but no mobile technology
      components. The control condition represents an intensive standard of care and helps control
      for monitoring, counselor, time, and attention effects.

      The primary outcome for the study will be self-reported and bio-verified prolonged smoking
      abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. Self-reported prolonged abstinence will be verified by
      saliva cotinine assay. Secondary outcomes will include 7- and 30-day point prevalence
      abstinence at each assessment, where abstinence is defined as no tobacco use in the prior 7
      or 30 days.
