      The study aim to capture key quality indicators and patient satisfaction for 800 patients
      referred for a colonoscopy at Aalborg University Hospital. The patient population is mix of
      screening and non-screening colonoscopies seen at our out-patient clinic.

      Each Colonoscopy is registered using a specially designed registration form and a more
      detailed form relating to the colonoscopy itself. The data collected includes: The
      Colonoscopist endoscopy experience and education, Medicine use, Colonoscopy duration,
      Unadjusted Caecum Intubations rate, Polyp detection rate, Polyps removed, Cancer detection
      rate and Nurse assisted Gloucester Comfort score.

      Patient level data were recorded using a questionaire with 6 questions regarding
      satisfaction, pain, discomfort etc on a 10 cm analog scale.

          -  All patients referred to colonoscopy at the out-patient clinic at Aalborg University
             department.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rejection to fill out questionaire.

          -  Patents referred to AVA (advanced endoscopy unit) were excluded as the are not
             comparable to regular colonoscopies. Most patients are referred to AVA for specific
             endoscopy treatments such as large polyp removals etc.
