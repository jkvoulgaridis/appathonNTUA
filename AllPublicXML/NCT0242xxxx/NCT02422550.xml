  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently one of the standard diagnostic imaging methods
      used to diagnose tumor stage before treatment in the Radiation Oncology Department. It is
      also used to check responses to radiation after treatment. However, MRI isn't traditionally
      used in planning for radiation treatment or in checking treated tumor and tissue changes
      during radiation treatment. The goal is to find out the possible benefits of MRI imaging
      techniques in these settings of radiation treatment. The research aims are to study the
      possibility of using devices with new abilities such as the MR-Linac. The MR-Linac combines a
      radiation treatment machine with a diagnostic MRI scanner. This device will improve the
      quality of MRI-guided radiation treatment. The MR-Linac has functions that are currently not
      available in other combined imaging and radiation delivery devices. The MR-Linac does not
      provide additional imaging capabilities that are not currently available in other imaging
      devices.

      Participating in this study would NOT change the current treatment plans, this will allow the
      investigators to use the MRI methods in research and future patient care.

      The purpose of this protocol is to demonstrate proof of concept and feasibility of new MRI
      hardware, pulse sequences and data analysis software to plan radiotherapy treatment and to
      assess tumor response to radiotherapy (only FDA approved hardware are allowed in this study).
      Efforts to develop, modify and evaluate new or existing MR imaging techniques must be a
      continuous practice with the goal of enhancing the use of MRI during radiation therapy. The
      investigators therefore anticipate an ongoing need for such a protocol and believe the
      ability to perform such studies is critical to the translation of new imaging technologies
      from concept to routine clinical use. Under this protocol, modifications to the following
      items may be tested: pulse sequence programs, radiofrequency coils, reconstruction and
      processing software, other MR system hardware and analysis software. A brief description of
      each of these items is described below. The potential risks associated with modifying each of
      these items, and the measures that will be taken to minimize these risks are described in
      subsequent sections.

      Given that performing MRI examinations during radiation therapy is not the current standard
      of care, no changes to radiation treatment plans, radiotherapy delivery or treatment
      recommendations or guidelines will be done based on the findings for any participants entered
      on this protocol.
