  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect
      of 3 different doses of Treg therapy in adults with skin (cutaneous) involvement of their
      lupus. Targeting cutaneous disease offers the ability to control background therapy, readily
      detect clinical effects, and perform research analyses not only in blood but also skin.
      Safety, disease activity, and mechanism of Tregs will be evaluated. The intent is to support
      dose selection for a future larger efficacy trial in lupus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational therapy in this trial, regulatory T cells (Tregs), is evaluating an
      alternative to traditional immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE, lupus). Too frequently, aggressive therapies are inadequate in the
      control of the disease and have potent side effects and complications. The collection and
      expansion of one's own T cells harnesses a naturally occurring regulatory mechanism to
      restore self-tolerance in people with lupus. Tregs are a specialized subset of T cells that
      function to control the immune response. Studies have shown that in active lupus, the numbers
      and function of Treg cells are significantly decreased, which contributes to an overactive
      immune system and an increase in disease activity. The hope is that these naturally occurring
      Treg cells can be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including lupus.

    <description>The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) is a validated, physician-based assessment tool used to measure cutaneous lupus severity. Severity is calculated based on disease activity (erythema and scale) and damage (dyspigmentation and scarring) for the cumulative areas of involved skin. Severity categories based on the CLASI activity score are as follows: mild (0-9), moderate (10-20), and severe (21-70). A 4-point or 20% change in the CLASI activity score identifies a clinically meaningful change. A 4-point increase in the CLASI activity score indicates a flare.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) Activity Score</title>
        <description>The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) is a validated, physician-based assessment tool used to measure cutaneous lupus severity. Severity is calculated based on disease activity (erythema and scale) and damage (dyspigmentation and scarring) for the cumulative areas of involved skin. Severity categories based on the CLASI activity score are as follows: mild (0-9), moderate (10-20), and severe (21-70). A 4-point or 20% change in the CLASI activity score identifies a clinically meaningful change. A 4-point increase in the CLASI activity score indicates a flare.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum C3 Complement Levels</title>
        <description>C3 is a blood test that measures the activity of the complement component 3 (C3) protein. The normal C3 range is 71 to 159 mg/dL. Those with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may have a lower-than-normal level of C3. A decrease in C3 level over time may indicate SLE disease activity.</description>
