  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline for the
      treatment of Late Onset Sepsis in neonates and young infants aged 7 to &lt;60 days
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study of intravenous
      (IV) ceftaroline fosamil and ampicillin, plus an optional aminoglycoside of choice, in
      hospitalized neonates and young infants aged 7 to &lt; 60 days with late-onset sepsis (LOS).

      Baseline assessments for study eligibility will occur within 36 hours before administration
      of the first dose of study therapy. Study Day 1 is defined as the 24-hour period starting at
      the onset of the first administration of study therapy. Thereafter, subsequent Study Days are
      to follow the same pattern.

      Safety assessments will occur throughout the study. Clinical outcome evaluations will occur
      at End-of-Therapy (EOT; within 24 hours after completion of last infusion) and Test-of-Cure
      (TOC; 8 to 15 days after the last dose of study therapy).

    <time_frame>Baseline up to SFU visit (up to a maximum study duration of 49 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to study follow-up (SFU) visit (28 to 35 days after last dose of study treatment) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of infusion (EOI)</time_frame>
    <description>Data was not summarized and provided for individual participants only and reported in this end point for only those participants who had concentrations above limit of quantification (LOQ). LOQ was 50 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

    <time_frame>At EOI, 15 minutes to 2 hours, 3 to 4 hours and 5 to 7 hours after EOI</time_frame>
    <description>Ceftaroline M-1 was the inactive metabolite of ceftaroline. Data was not summarized and provided for individual participants only and reported in this end point for only those participants who had concentrations above LOQ at any specific time-point. LOQ was 50 ng/mL</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Favorable Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>EOT visit (up to Day 15), TOC visit (up to Day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was assessed by the investigator as Cure, Failure or Indeterminate at End of treatment (EOT) and Test of Cure (TOC). Favorable clinical response was defined as clinical response of Cure (defined as resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of Late-onset sepsis [LOS] or improvement to such an extent that no further antibacterial therapy is required). EOT visit occurred within 24 hours after the end of last infusion. TOC visit occurred within 8 to 15 days after the last dose of study therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Favorable Microbiological Response</measure>
    <time_frame>EOT visit (up to Day 15), TOC visit (up to Day 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological response was determining programmatically and assessed at the participants level at EOT and TOC. Microbiological response was defined as Favorable (Eradication or Presumed Eradication), Unfavorable (Persistence or Presumed Persistence) or Indeterminate (participant's clinical response is Indeterminate and no microbiological culture data is available). Eradication defined as absence of the original baseline pathogen from the source specimen; presumed eradication was defined when source specimen was not available to culture and the participant was assessed as a clinical cure (resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of LOS or improvement to such an extent that no further antibacterial therapy was required). EOT visit occurred within 24 hours after the end of last infusion. TOC visit occurred within 8 to 15 days after last dose of study drug.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to study follow-up (SFU) visit (28 to 35 days after last dose of study treatment) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>
