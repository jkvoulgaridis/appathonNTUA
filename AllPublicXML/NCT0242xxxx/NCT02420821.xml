Participants with a PFS event who missed &gt;/=2 scheduled assessments immediately prior to the PFS event were censored at the last tumor assessment prior to the missed visits. Median PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% confidence interval (CI) was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

Median PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% confidence interval (CI) was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <title>PFS as Determined by an IRC According to RECIST v1.1 in ITT Population</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to PD, as determined by an IRC per RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. PD: &gt;/=20% relative increase in the SoD of all TLs, taking as reference the smallest SoD on study, including baseline, and an absolute increase of &gt;/=5 mm; &gt;/=1 new lesion(s); and/or unequivocal progression of non-TLs. Participants without PFS event were censored at the last tumor assessment date. Participants with no post-baseline tumor assessments were censored at the randomization date + 1 day. Median PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response of CR or PR as Determined by the Investigator According to Immune-Modified RECIST in ORR-Evaluable Population</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by the investigator according to immune-modified RECIST. Objective response was defined as percentage of participants with a documented CR or PR. CR was defined as disappearance of all TLs/non-TLs or reduction in short axis of any pathological lymph nodes to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as &gt;/=30% decrease in the SoD of TLs and all new measurable lesions (taking as reference the baseline SoD), in the absence of CR. The 95% CI was computed using Clopper-Pearson approach. Participants without any post-baseline tumor assessments were considered non-responders.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Symptom Interference as Determined by M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) Part II Score</title>
        <description>The MDASI is a cancer-related, multi-symptom, valid, and reliable self-report questionnaire that comprises of 23 items and two subscales: symptom severity (17 items) and symptom interference (6 items). In Part II, participants were asked to rate how much the symptoms have interfered with 6 areas of function (general activity, walking, work, mood, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life) in the last 24 hours. Each item was rated on a scale of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (interfered completely) and total Part II score was calculated as an average of 6-item scores. Repeated measures model-estimated least-squares (LS) mean score for changes from baseline is reported at each timepoint, where a negative value indicates improvement. Here, 'Number Analyzed' = number of participants evaluable at specified time point.</description>

        <description>The MDASI is a cancer-related, multi-symptom, valid, and reliable self-report questionnaire that comprises of 23 items and two subscales: symptom severity (17 items) and symptom interference (6 items). In Part I, participants were asked to rate how severe the symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, feeling of being distressed, shortness of breath, remembering things, lack of appetite, drowsy, dry mouth, feeling sad, vomiting, numbness or tingling, rash/skin changes, headache, mouth/throat sores, and diarrhea) were when &quot;at their worst&quot; in the last 24 hours. Each item was rated on a scale of 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). Mixed-effects model-estimated LS mean score for change from baseline at the end-of treatment is reported for each item, where a negative value indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Symptom Severity as Determined by Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Interference Scale Score</title>
        <description>The BFI is a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire used to assess the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue. BFI interference subscale (6 items) assessed the impact of fatigue on global domains (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life) in the last 24 hours. Each item was rated on a scale of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (interfered completely). Change from baseline in the mean score of all 6 items at each timepoint is reported, where a negative value indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 Cycle 1); every week for first 12 weeks, Days 1 and 22 of each cycle (Cycle 3 up to 19), within 30 days of PD (up to 27 months), at EoT (up to 27 months) and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks after EoT (overall up to 27 months); 1 cycle=42 days</time_frame>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Symptom Severity as Determined by BFI Worst Fatigue Item</title>
        <description>The BFI is a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire used to assess the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue. BFI worst fatigue item assessed the severity of fatigue at its worst in the last 24 hours. The item was rated on a scale of 0 (not present) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine). Change from baseline in the score at each time point is reported, where a negative value indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 Cycle 1); every week for first 12 weeks, Days 1 and 22 of each cycle (Cycle 3 up to 19), within 30 days of PD (up to 27 months), at EoT (up to 27 months) and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks after EoT (overall up to 27 months); 1 cycle=42 days</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on the PRO-Evaluable Population. Here, 'Overall Number of Participants Analyzed’ = number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure; 'Number Analyzed' = number of participants evaluable at specified time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Side Effects Burden as Determined by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-19) General Population 5 (GP5) Item Score</title>
        <description>The FKSI-19 is a 19-item tool designed to assess the most important symptoms and concerns related to treatment effectiveness in advanced kidney cancer. The FKSI-19 GP5 item (bothered by the side effect of treatment) assessed side effects burden in the past 7 days on a 5-point scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Repeated measures model-estimated LS mean score for changes from baseline is reported at each timepoint, where a negative value indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on the PRO-Evaluable Population. Here, 'Number Analyzed' = number of participants evaluable at specified time point.</population>
