      intervention, indications for undergoing endoscopic intervention, details of the pancreatic
      fluid collections on cross-sectional imaging and EUS, review of laboratory results, review of
      imaging, details of interventions performed for pancreatic fluid collections, clinical
      details following intervention, adverse events from interventions and pancreatitis/pancreatic
      fluid collections, interventions for any adverse events, response to treatment of pancreatic
      fluid collections including any hospital readmissions, recurrence of pancreatic fluid
      collections, need for repeat interventions for pancreatic fluid collections, details of
      pancreatic duct integrity such as the presence of disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome, and
      clinical status at follow-up.

      For pancreatic cysts, data included in this registry are 60 variables on patient demographics
      (age, gender, race), symptoms at presentation, imaging modality performed to detect the cyst,
      features of the cyst on EUS, features of the main pancreatic duct on EUS, technical details
      of EUS-guided sampling of the cystic fluid, results of cyst fluid analysis including
      cytology, tumor markers, amylase levels, molecular markers, final diagnosis of the cyst on
      follow-up, details of any follow up evaluation performed, details of repeat examinations
      performed and details of any treatment performed for the pancreatic cyst.

    <measure>Impact of placement of long-term plastic transmural stents in patients with pancreatic fluid collections and disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (minimum) to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of placement of long-term plastic transmural stents in patients with pancreatic fluid collections and disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome will be assessed.</description>
