    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the incremental area under the curve from 0 to 24h
      (iAUC0-24h) of plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) after ingestion of an emulsified product and a
      non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at the lowest appropriate dose
      that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the test products' recommended
      daily dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many dietary lipids are in the form of triglycerides, ethyl esters or phospholipids. During
      digestion these lipids are subject to hydrolysis, in particular by pancreatic triglyceride
      lipase. To facilitate the action of the enzyme, lipids are emulsified by the action of bile
      salts. By increasing the surface area of the fat globules, emulsification increases access to
      the lipids by pancreatic triglyceride lipase. This study is designed to compare iAUC0-24h of
      plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free EPA and DHA) after ingestion of an
      emulsified product and a non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at
      the lowest appropriate dose that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the
      test products' recommended daily dose.

    <description>The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method and using nominal time points from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h respectively.

        <description>The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal method and using nominal time points from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10h respectively. The AUC was divided by the total duration to represent a weighted mean incremental change over time. Higher values of AUC demonstrate better rate of absorption over time than lower values.</description>

      <desc>Safety population (N=50) included all participants who were randomized and administered at least one study treatment during the study (47 participants were treated with both Scott’s Emulsion Original and Cod liver oil; 1 participant was treated with Scott’s Emulsion only and 2 were treated with Cod liver oil only). Therefore, a total of 48 participants were included in Scotts emulsion (test product) arm and 49 in Cod liver oil (reference product) arm.</desc>
