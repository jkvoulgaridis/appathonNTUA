    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Perampanel</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until perampanel was commercially available, up to approximately 1 year 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), withdrawal from treatment, clinical laboratory tests (chemistry), vital signs, and weight. TEAEs were defined as AEs that emerged from the first dose of study drug to the last visit of Study 341 or on or after 30 days since the last dose of study drug in Study 341, whichever comes later, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline of Study 332). A markedly abnormal clinical chemistry laboratory value was defined as a laboratory result that worsened in severity to meet modified National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity criteria of Grade 2 or higher on treatment. Treatment-related TEAEs were defined as AEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study treatment. SAEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose; resulted in death, disability/incapacity, birth defect, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or was life-threatening.</description>

Doses of perampanel were allowed to be adjusted based on clinical judgment. A minimum perampanel dose of 2 milligram (mg) per day was required to continue in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participants participating in the designated perampanel study as below, and who in the
             opinion of the investigator continue to benefit from treatment with perampanel
             Designated perampanel study: E2007-G000-332 (NCT01393743) (with at least 52 weeks of
             total exposure to perampanel).

          2. Provide written informed consent/assent signed by participant or legal guardian prior
             to entering the study or undergoing any study procedures. If the written informed
             consent is provided by the legal guardian because the participant is unable to do so,
             a written or verbal assent from the participant must also be obtained.

          3. Female participants of childbearing potential must agree for the duration of the study
             and for a period of at least 1 month following the last dose of perampanel to be
             abstinent or to commit to the consistent and correct use of a medically acceptable
             method of birth control (eg, a double-barrier method [condom plus spermicide, condom
             plus diaphragm with spermicide]).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Participants residing in countries where perampanel is commercially available with
             respect to the indication or formulation of the designated perampanel study.

          2. Female participants who are nursing, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant.
