  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hygieia Research seeks to conduct a prospective randomized clinical study involving adult
      subjects with uncontrolled Type-2 diabetes requiring insulin. The study seeks to demonstrate
      that the clinical application of the d-Nav will achieve metabolic control in a safe and
      effective manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the use of d-Nav (d-Nav group) is superior
      to titration of insulin dosage relying on data from glucose meters with health care provider
      support (Control) in the management of insulin treated diabetes, by randomizing 200 insulin
      treated subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Primary Objective: To demonstrate a greater reduction in HbA1c at 6-months for d-Nav users
      compared to control patients in the primary cohort.
