    <textblock>
      The Genomic Sequencing for Childhood Risk and Newborn Illness (the BabySeq Project) is a
      research study exploring the use of genomic sequencing in newborns. The National Institutes
      of Health is funding this study.

      The investigators will enroll 240 healthy infants and their parents from the Brigham and
      Women's Hospital (BWH) Well Newborn Nursery and 240 sick infants and their parents at Boston
      Children's Hospital (BCH) or the BWH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A small blood
      sample will be collected from each infant and genome sequencing may be performed. Six weeks
      later, results are returned and explained. Over 12 months the investigators are studying the
      experiences of parents and pediatricians of infants who receive sequencing to help understand
      how best to use genomics in pediatric care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research protocol is to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess
      the benefits and risks of adding the information from a genomic sequencing report to
      physician-mediated medical care of newborns during their pediatric years.

      The investigators will enroll 240 healthy infants and their parents from the Brigham and
      Women's Hospital (BWH) Well Newborn Nursery and 240 sick infants and their parents at Boston
      Children's Hospital (BCH) or the BWH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

      A small blood sample will be obtained from each enrolled infant. Samples will be collected
      from all infants enrolled, regardless of the arm to which they are assigned, in order to
      follow the same protocol for all subjects prior to randomization.

      Infants within each cohort will be randomized (1:1) to either standard-of-care (family
      history and standard newborn screening report) or to standard-of-care plus genomic
      sequencing.

      A study physician and genetic counselor will disclose the infant's randomization assignment
      and study results during an in-person consultation with each family. The study physician and
      genetic counselor will provide the consultation to families utilizing all available medical
      information. In the sequencing arm of the study, this will include the medical history,
      physical exam, family history, standard newborn screening (NBS) report and sequencing
      report(s). In the non-sequencing arm of the study, this will include the medical history,
      physical exam, family history and standard NBS report.

      Parents will be surveyed at four points over the 12 months after enrollment: baseline,
      immediately post-disclosure (approximately 6 weeks after enrollment), 3 months
      post-disclosure, and at 10 months post-disclosure.
