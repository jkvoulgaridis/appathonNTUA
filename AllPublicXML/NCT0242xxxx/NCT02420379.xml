  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics
      of eteplirsen in patients with early stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are amenable
      to exon 51 skipping.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety, including adverse event monitoring and routine laboratory assessments, will be
      followed on an ongoing basis for all patients.

      Clinical efficacy, including functional tests and MRI, will be assessed at regularly
      scheduled study visits. Patients will undergo one baseline and one follow-up muscle biopsy.

      Population and serial PK will be collected.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, and TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death; Life-threatening event; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent adverse events were events that developed or worsened during the on-treatment period (defined as time from first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug [up to 100 weeks]) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities Reported as TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory parameters included hematology, serum chemistry (SC), urinalysis and coagulation. Number of participants with at least one potentially clinically significant abnormal findings were reported as TEAEs. The Investigator determined whether abnormal assessment results were clinically significant or not clinically significant. Clinical significance was defined as any variation in assessment results that had medical relevance resulting in an alteration in medical care.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Vital Signs Reported as TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vital sign parameters included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and body temperature. Number of participants with at least one potentially clinically significant abnormal vital signs findings were reported as TEAEs. The Investigator determined whether abnormal assessment results were clinically significant or not clinically significant. Clinical significance was defined as any variation in assessment results that had medical relevance resulting in an alteration in medical care.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Abnormal Physical Examination Finding</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 100 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical examinations, full and brief, were performed by the Investigator, a physician Sub-Investigator, or a Nurse Practitioner (if licensed in the state or province to perform physical examinations). Full physical examinations included examination of general appearance; head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; chest; abdomen; skin; lymph nodes; and musculoskeletal and neurological systems. Number of participants with at least one abnormal physical examination findings were reported. Abnormality in physical examinations was based on Investigator's discretion.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Electrocardiograms (ECGs) Reported as TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve-lead ECGs and Holter ECGs were performed at a consistent time of day throughout the study. Electrocardiograms were performed only after the participant was in the supine position, resting, and quiet for a minimum of 15 minutes. The ECG was manually reviewed and interpreted by medically qualified personnel. Number of participants with at least one abnormalities in ECGs were reported as TEAEs.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Echocardiograms (ECHO) Reported as TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Standard, 2-dimensional ECHOs were performed at a consistent time of day throughout the study. Cardiac function events included cardiomegaly, tachycardia, and dyspnoea. The ECHO was reviewed and interpreted by medically qualified personnel. Number of participants with at least one abnormalities in ECHO were reported as TEAEs.</description>

        <description>Adverse Event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death; Life-threatening event; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent adverse events were events that developed or worsened during the on-treatment period (defined as time from first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug [up to 100 weeks]) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>
