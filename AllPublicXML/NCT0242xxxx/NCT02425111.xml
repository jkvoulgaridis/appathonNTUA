      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have Crohn's disease. This study will look at mucosal healing in people who
      take vedolizumab.

      The study will enroll approximately 100 patients and will be conducted in 2 Parts. Part A
      will consist of a 26-week treatment period and all participants will receive vedolizumab 300
      mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22. Part B will consist of a 26-week
      extension treatment period and all participants will receive vedolizumab 300 mg IV at Weeks
      30, 38, and 46.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 70 weeks for Parts A, B and 18-Week Follow-up combined. Participants
      will make multiple visits to the clinic. All participants included in the study will also
      have a 6 month safety follow-up telephone call following his/her last dose of study drug.

    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as a simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) score of ≤4. The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, proportion of the surface area that is ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable is the sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

The score for each endoscopic variable is the sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

          <description>Endoscopic response is defined as a reduction in SES-CD from Baseline by ≥50%. The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, proportion of the surface area that is ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable is the sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

      <desc>At each visit adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory findings reported by participant or observed by the investigator were recorded, irrespective of relation to study treatment. Due to the design of the study, the most common (≥ 5%) non-serious AEs were determined separately for each period of the study, Part A and Part B. A result of 0 in a column means that the event did not meet the ≥ 5% threshold for that study period but did meet the threshold for the other study period.</desc>
