      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of v-akt murine thymoma
      viral oncogene homolog (Akt)/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1(ERK) inhibitor ONC201 and to
      see how well it works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has returned
      after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine recommended phase II dose for oral ONC201 (Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201) in
      patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) II. To identify toxicities associated
      with oral ONC201 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) III. To determine
      the objective response rate to ONC201 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase
      II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral ONC201 following administration. (Phase I)
      II. To observe the anti-tumor effects of oral ONC201, if any occur, in patients with
      relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase I) III. Confirm tolerability of recommended phase II
      dose. (Phase II) IV. Assess clinical outcomes associated with ONC201 treatment in patients
      with relapsed/refractory lymphomas. (Phase II) V. Correlate clinical outcome with tumor and
      serum biomarkers. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1 of every cycle or day 1 of
      every week. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
