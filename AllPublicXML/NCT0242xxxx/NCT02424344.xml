      The present study is planned to evaluate the effect of the aclidinium bromide/formoterol
      fumarate 400/12 μg FDC BID on the hyperinflation, exercise endurance and physical activity in
      patients with moderate to severe COPD. Additionally, the effect of the behavioural
      intervention on top of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate 400/12 μg will be assessed both
      on the exercise endurance and the physical activity.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) After 4 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline values in FRC were defined as the corresponding values just before randomization on Day 1 of treatment (Week 0). Trough values were obtained prior to study drug administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Endurance Time (ET) During Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ET was the time from the increase in work rate to 75% Wmax to the point of symptom limitation.
Baseline measurements were taken prior to the IP dose on Day 1. Measurements at Week 8 were taken at 3 hours post-dose. Participants underwent a behavioural intervention (consisting of a telecoaching programme to enhance physical activity) between Week 4 and Week 8.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Inactive Patients (Mean of &lt;6000 Steps Per Day) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity was assessed by means of measurement of activity parameters (e.g. number of steps) through a Dynaport MoveMonitor and completion of the Daily ProActive Physical Activity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) questionnaire.
Compliant criterion based on at least 8 hours per day, and at least 3 days per week. Participants underwent a behavioural intervention (consisting of a telecoaching programme to enhance physical activity) between Week 4 and Week 8.
Baseline was defined as mean of steps/day assessed during the week before the randomisation visit.</description>
