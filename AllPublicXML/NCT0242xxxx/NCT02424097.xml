  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of multiple applications of
      MI Varnish in combination with MI Paste Plus in caries protection and remineralization in
      comparison to the use of a control (Crest 1,100ppm Fluoride tooth paste, Fluoride rinse
      recommendation) in orthodontic patients in a randomized, single blind, prospective,
      controlled clinical trial over 12 months.

      The effect will be measured by white spot lesion regression and prevention as lesion count.
      Lesions will be scored using the Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI) area evaluation scheme
      (primary outcome), International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS), the caries
      lesion activity criteria (Nyvad criteria; Bente Nyvad, Scandinavian Researcher), and
      Quantitative Light Fluorescence (QLF, Inspektor Pro, Netherlands)/SOPROLIFE (SOPROLIFE
      fluorescence camera system, Acteon, France) evaluation in maxillary and mandibular anterior
      teeth with orthodontic brackets in treatment and control groups.

      The study is designed as randomized, single blind, prospective, clinical trial over 12
      months. The subjects for this study will be recruited from the University of California at
      San Francisco UCSF, School of Dentistry, Orthodontic Clinic.

      Participants in the study will be patients, who are in orthodontic treatment or will start
      orthodontic treatment; subjects must have full fixed appliances, with brackets bonded to the
      buccal surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, canines and first bicuspids.
      Subjects will be of moderate or high caries risk according to Caries Risk Assessment and ATP
      (Adenosine triphosphate) bacteria testing. Subjects will present with at least two active
      white spot lesions on his/her anterior teeth at the start of the study. The age limitation is
      ≥ 11 years.

      The subjects will be randomly assigned to 1) Experimental group: MI Varnish and MI Paste Plus
      or 2) Control standard of care group: 1,100 ppm Fluoride tooth paste and recommendation to
      use OTC (Over-the-counter) Fluoride-rinse in the evening at home.

      The clinical study investigator will evaluate the labial/buccal surfaces of upper and lower
      anterior teeth (first bicuspid to first bicuspid) for white spot lesions (WSL) at baseline
      and at the end of 3, 6, and 12 months. Newly formed lesions and changes in existing white
      spot lesions will be documented (using Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI), ICDAS II, light
      digital photographs and blue fluorescence photography SOPROLIFE and QLF- Quantitative Light
      Fluorescence).

      All subjects will receive one professional tooth cleaning at baseline and at each other
      evaluation office visit to allow WSL evaluation (cleaning with ultrasonic device, and
      prophylaxis brush) and treatment application.

    <measure>Change in White Spot Lesions Count - Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The area evaluation scheme of the Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI) divides the buccal surface of each tooth into 4 quadrants and then registers the possible existence of a white spot lesion (decalcification) in each of these 4 quadrants. For each quadrant the lesion can be scaled as: 0 = no decalcification, 1 = decalcification covering &lt;50% of the area, 2 = decalcification covering &gt; 50% of the area, 3 = decalcifications covering 100% of the area or severe decalcification with cavitation. Thus, for each tooth the value can range between 0 and 12.
16 teeth per subject were evaluated, for each subject the value of each tooth was added - thus the range per one subject can be between 0 and 192.
A mean over all participants in one group was calculated. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II) to Score for Smooth Surfaces White Spot Lesions (WSL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II) is a standardized method of caries lesion assessment.The score is based on apparent lesion severity, with scores from 0 to 6.The buccal surface of each tooth was divided into 4 quadrants, and for each quadrant a score was assigned with ICDAS scores: 0 = sound, 1 = first visual change in enamel, after air drying, 2 = distinct demineralization visual change in enamel, 3 = localized enamel breakdown due to caries with no visible dentin, 4 = surface with underlying dark shadow from dentin with or without enamel breakdown, 5 = distinct cavity with visible dentin, 6 = extensive cavity with visible dentin.
The ICDAS scores were calculated as the sum of the highest ICDAS scores assigned to each examined tooth per subject. 16 teeth per subject were evaluated, thus, for each subject the value can range between 0 and 96.
A mean over all participants in one group was calculated. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change in White Spot Lesions Count - Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI)</title>
        <description>The area evaluation scheme of the Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI) divides the buccal surface of each tooth into 4 quadrants and then registers the possible existence of a white spot lesion (decalcification) in each of these 4 quadrants. For each quadrant the lesion can be scaled as: 0 = no decalcification, 1 = decalcification covering &lt;50% of the area, 2 = decalcification covering &gt; 50% of the area, 3 = decalcifications covering 100% of the area or severe decalcification with cavitation. Thus, for each tooth the value can range between 0 and 12.
16 teeth per subject were evaluated, for each subject the value of each tooth was added - thus the range per one subject can be between 0 and 192.
A mean over all participants in one group was calculated. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II) is a standardized method of caries lesion assessment.The score is based on apparent lesion severity, with scores from 0 to 6.The buccal surface of each tooth was divided into 4 quadrants, and for each quadrant a score was assigned with ICDAS scores: 0 = sound, 1 = first visual change in enamel, after air drying, 2 = distinct demineralization visual change in enamel, 3 = localized enamel breakdown due to caries with no visible dentin, 4 = surface with underlying dark shadow from dentin with or without enamel breakdown, 5 = distinct cavity with visible dentin, 6 = extensive cavity with visible dentin.
The ICDAS scores were calculated as the sum of the highest ICDAS scores assigned to each examined tooth per subject. 16 teeth per subject were evaluated, thus, for each subject the value can range between 0 and 96.
A mean over all participants in one group was calculated. A higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
