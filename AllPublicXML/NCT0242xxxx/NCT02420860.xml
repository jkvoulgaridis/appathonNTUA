  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well elotuzumab works when given with lenalidomide as
      maintenance therapy after transplant in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who
      underwent transplant using their own stem cells (autologous transplant). Maintenance therapy
      is treatment that is given to help keep cancer from coming back after it has disappeared
      following the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      elotuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may
      stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.
      Adding elotuzumab to standard maintenance therapy with lenalidomide may work better in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma who have undergone transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish activity of elotuzumab and lenalidomide in the maintenance setting post
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in myeloma patients.

      II. Progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival 2. II. Overall survival. III. Determine incidence of secondary
      primary malignancy. IV. Evaluate the best response rate (stringent complete response
      [sCR]/very good partial response [VGPR]/partial response [PR]) based on International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG) criteria.

      V. Evaluate time to progression. VI. Evaluate time to next therapy. VII. Evaluate the
      tolerability and toxicity. VIII. Perform MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Myeloma
      symptom evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of
      courses 1-2 and on day 1 of each subsequent course. Patients also receive lenalidomide orally
      (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
