    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the immunogenicity and safety of Sanofi Pasteur's
      DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine (Hexaxim®) administered at 2,
      3, and 4 months of age and at 16 to 17 months of age in infants and toddlers who received a
      dose of Hep B vaccine at birth or within 1 week after birth.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the safety profile after each and all doses of Sanofi-Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-Hep
           B-PRP-T combined vaccine in Vietnamese infants and toddlers.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response to all antigens induced by the
           study vaccine in Vietnamese infants one month after the third dose in a 3-dose primary
           series with the immune response to all antigens induced by the same study vaccine
           outside Vietnam.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine one month after the 3-dose primary
           series.

        -  To describe the persistence of all antibodies before receipt of the booster vaccination.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine one month after the booster.

      Participants will receive a total of 5 doses of Hep B: One dose of Hep B monovalent vaccine
      given at birth or within 1 week after birth followed by 3 doses of the Sanofi Pasteur's
      hexavalent vaccine given as primary series at 2, 3, and 4 months of age and then a booster
      dose at 16 to 17 months of age, to comply with Vietnamese vaccination recommendations.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in this trial were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in 2 cohorts. All participants in both cohorts received Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T combined vaccine in a 3-dose Infant Series. Participants from Cohort 1 provided blood samples for immunogenicity assessment and were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity. Participants in Cohort 2 did not provide any blood samples for immunogenicity analysis and were evaluated for safety only.</intervention_model_description>
