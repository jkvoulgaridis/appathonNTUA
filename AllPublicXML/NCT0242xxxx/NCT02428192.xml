    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab works
      in treating patients with uterine cancer that has spread to other places in the body and
      usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 of patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma of the uterus (ULMS) treated with
      nivolumab.

      II. To evaluate the objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 of patients with advanced ULMS
      treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of nivolumab in patients with advanced ULMS. II. To evaluate the
      toxicity of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in patients with advanced ULMS.

      III. To evaluate the progression-free survival of ULMS treated with nivolumab. IV. To
      evaluate the progression-free survival of ULMS treated with nivolumab in combination with
      ipilimumab.

      V. To explore the relationship between PDL1, PD1 in infiltrating lymphocytes and PD2 status
      in archival tumor, and pre/post treatment biopsies in a minimum of 10 patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the relationship between general immune response and specific markers of
      immunomodulation and response to nivolumab.

      II. To explore the relationship between tumor inflammatory gene signature and response to
      nivolumab in archival material.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      Cohort A (closed to accrual on 21-Oct-2015): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV)
      over approximately 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for up to 46 doses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohort B: Patients receive nivolumab IV over approximately 60 minutes followed by a saline
      flush and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.

    <time_frame>Up to 100 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary endpoint of overall response with a null hypothesis of 5% and an alternative hypothesis of 20%, 37 patients are needed in a two-stage design with 12 patients in the first stage and 25 patients in the second stage. At the first stage analysis, overall response, at least 1 response out of 12 patients will need to be observed to continue through the second stage. At the second stage, at least 4 responses out of 37 patients will need to be observed to accept the treatment. The overall power for overall response rate is 90%. The overall type I error, the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is 9%. The probability of stopping at the first stage under the null hypothesis is 54%. The operating characteristics of this design are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

        <description>For the primary endpoint of overall response with a null hypothesis of 5% and an alternative hypothesis of 20%, 37 patients are needed in a two-stage design with 12 patients in the first stage and 25 patients in the second stage. At the first stage analysis, overall response, at least 1 response out of 12 patients will need to be observed to continue through the second stage. At the second stage, at least 4 responses out of 37 patients will need to be observed to accept the treatment. The overall power for overall response rate is 90%. The overall type I error, the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is 9%. The probability of stopping at the first stage under the null hypothesis is 54%. The operating characteristics of this design are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>

          <title>Objective Response Per RECIST 1.1 Among Patients With Advanced ULMS Treated With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (Cohort B)</title>
          <description>For the primary endpoint of overall response with a null hypothesis of 5% and an alternative hypothesis of 30%, 25 patients are needed in a two-stage design with 8 patients in the first stage and 17 patients in the second stage. At the first stage analysis, overall response, at least 1 response out of 8 patients will need to be observed to continue through the second stage. At the second stage, at least 3 responses out of 25 patients will need to be observed to accept the treatment. The overall power for overall response rate is 94%. The overall type I error, the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is 9%. The probability of stopping at the first stage under the null hypothesis is 66%. The operating characteristics of this design are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.</description>
