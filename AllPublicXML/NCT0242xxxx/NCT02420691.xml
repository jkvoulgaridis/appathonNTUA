  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ribociclib works in treating patients with
      neuroendocrine tumors of the foregut, which includes the thymus, lung, stomach, and pancreas,
      that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with
      treatment (advanced tumors). Ribociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1)
      objective response rate of LEE011 (ribociclib) among patients with advanced foregut
      neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival duration of LEE011 among patients with advanced
      foregut NETs.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEE011 in patients with advanced foregut NETs.

      III. To determine clinic benefit rate at 6 months (defined as complete response plus partial
      response plus stable disease) with LEE011 among patients with advanced foregut NETs.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine baseline molecular markers (mutations, deletions, and amplifications in
      multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN]1, p27, p16 and cyclin D1 [CCND1]) in archival tumor that
      may predict clinical benefit at 6 months from LEE011.

      II. To determine potential mechanisms/markers of resistance. III. To determine early
      chromogranin and neuron specific enolase responses in patients with elevated levels at
      baseline.

      IV. To determine the pharmacodynamic changes including proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen
      (Ki-67) and phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb) upon treatment with LEE011 in patients with
      advanced foregut NETs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation; highly effective
             contraception methods include: total abstinence when this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception; female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
             taking study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment; male
             sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening); for female patients on the
             study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient;

             foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository; in case of use of oral contraception, women
             should have been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment; note: oral
             contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of
             contraception; women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential
             if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
             clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive

             considered not of child bearing potential

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol

          -  Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin-derived anticoagulant for
             treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise; therapy with heparin, low molecular weight
