      The purpose of this study is to prospectively analyze the value of 3D ultrasound perfusion
      imaging for treatment planning, the prediction of therapy success, and to monitor the
      treatment response in patients with a primary or metastatic liver tumor undergoing radiation
      treatment.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objectives of this prospective pilot study is to:

        1. determine the feasibility and reproducibility of 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging
           in liver cancer patients undergoing Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy and

        2. evaluate whether there are treatment induced early changes in imaging metrics derived
           from 3D contrast enhanced ultrasound. This study will provide valuable insight as to the
           potential of baseline and/or early post-treatment 3D ultrasound perfusion
           characteristics (measurements of blood-flow) of primary and metastatic liver tumors to
           predict tumor response to Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy. The investigators'
           underlying goal is to assess whether early perfusion changes at 1-7 days after SABR
           initiation can be used as a non-invasive early biomarker for treatment response
           assessment.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Evaluate the feasibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound-to-CT fusion by assisting
      three-dimensional (3D) perfusion ultrasound (US) imaging with optical and electromagnetic
      tracking of the ultrasound probe on patients with liver cancer that will undergo CT for
      treatment planning and/or response evaluation.
