    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching elderly
      participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) from a prior antidepressant treatment
      (to which they have not responded) to either intranasal esketamine plus a new oral
      antidepressant or switching to a new oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what
      treatment the participant is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter study (more than 1
      study site) in elderly participants with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of flexible doses of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant
      compared with a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal
      placebo. The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4 to
      7 weeks), Double-blind induction Phase (4 weeks), Follow up Phase (2 weeks). Participants who
      rollover into a long-term open-label safety study will not participate in the Follow-up
      Phase. At the start of the Screening/Prospective observational Phase, participant must have
      had documented nonresponse to at least one antidepressant treatment (based on Massachusetts
      General Hospital - Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [MGH-ATRQ] criteria) in
      the current episode of depression, and the participant is taking a different oral
      antidepressant treatment on the MGH-ATRQ for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the
      minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment will be discontinued prior to the
      double-blind induction Phase. Participants taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or
      less than the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep
      medications (example, zolpidem, zaleplon) during the screening/prospective observational
      phase can continue these medications. All participants will start with first dose (Day 1 as
      28 milligram [mg]); second dose (Day 4) is either 28 or 56 mg. All subsequent doses may be
      28, 56 or 84 mg. After the first dose, all dosing decisions are determined by the
      investigator based on efficacy and tolerability. In addition, each participant will be
      assigned to receive 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications from 2 different classes of
      antidepressant treatments, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram or
      sertraline) or a Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) [duloxetine or
      venlafaxine extended release (XR)], initiated on Day 1 and continued through the double-blind
      induction Phase. Participants will be primarily evaluated for improvement in depressive
      symptoms as assessed by change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score at Week 4. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score up to Endpoint (Double-blind Induction Phase [Day 28])- Mixed-Effects Model Using Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items (to evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel [interest level], pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), summed for a total possible score range of 0-60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. Negative change in score indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to Endpoint (Double-blind Induction Phase[Day 28])</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication and 1 dose of oral antidepressant medication during the double-blind induction phase. Here, N (Overall number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this endpoint.</population>

        <description>Percentage of participants with greater than or equal to (&gt;=50) percent (%) reduction from baseline are reported. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition. Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and last post baseline observation during the double-blind induction phase was carried forward as the &quot;End Point&quot; for that phase.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 2-part instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, designed for self-completion by respondents. It consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ VAS. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a health status index (HSI). HSI ranges from -0.148 (health state value equal to dead) and 0.949 (full health), is anchored at 0 (dead) and 1 (full health).</description>
