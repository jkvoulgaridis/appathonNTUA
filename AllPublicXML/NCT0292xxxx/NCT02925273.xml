  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will determine the difference between the two techniques
      used to elicit the grasp response in patients with frontal lobe dysfunction, primarily in
      dementia patients versus control patients.

      The goal of this project is to determine the optimal technique to elicit the grasping
      response in patients with dementia or suspected frontal lobe dysfunction. The proposed study
      is to perform two techniques to elicit grasp response in patients with dementia or suspected
      frontal lobe dysfunction and observe the presence or absence of the response and prominence
      of the response on a proposed rating scale. Future goals will be aimed at aiding clinicians
      in refining their clinical techniques to be more sensitive for diagnosing frontal lobe
      dysfunctions.

    <description>The primary objective of the study will be to determine if a change in the performance of the grasp response will lead to a change in the way the response is elicited. The prominence of the grasp response will be scored on a rating scale</description>

    <description>Prospective, grasp techniques will be compared in each patient from the experimental group using a palmar grasp without dorsal stimulation and a standard palmar grasp test with dorsal stimulation on the same patient as the control group</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>palmar grasp without dorsal stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient will then be asked to keep the arms at 90 degrees and the researcher will slightly stroke palm and fingers of both hands of the patient simultaneously. After completion of each technique, the presence or absence of the response will be noted. In addition, the prominence of the response on the rating scale will be obtained as explained below.
The scaling of the grasp response is as followed:
Flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint of the hand
Flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the hand
Flexion at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint of the hand</description>

  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>standard palmar grasp test with dorsal stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient will be asked to put their arms at 90 degrees and the researcher will hold one hand at the wrist and dorsum of the palm and lightly stroke the palm and fingers. The patient will be instructed to relax hands and not hold on while doing the grasp and see if the response persists. The same technique will be repeated for the patient's other hand.</description>
