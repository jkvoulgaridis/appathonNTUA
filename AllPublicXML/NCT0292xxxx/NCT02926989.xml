    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk of hypokalemia following
      administration of a isotonic solution compared to a hypotonic solution in acutely ill
      hospitalised children, who need intravenous fluid therapy.

      The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk of hypokalemia (low plasma potassium
      concentration) following administration of a Plasmalyte Glucos 50 mg/mL solution compared to
      a 0.45% saline in 5% dextrose solution in acutely ill hospitalised children, who need
      intravenous fluid therapy. The secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk of
      hyponatremia (low plasma sodium concentration) and the risk of hypernatremia (high plasma
      sodium concentration) following administration of isotonic solution compared to hypotonic
      solution.
