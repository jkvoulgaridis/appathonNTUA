  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)
      agonist SD-101 when given together with ibrutinib and radiation therapy and to see how well
      they work in treating patients with Low Grade Follicular Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, or
      Mantle Cell Lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or no longer responds
      to treatment. Immunostimulants such as TLR9 agonist SD-101 may increase the ability of the
      immune system to fight infection and disease. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving TLR9 agonist SD-101 with ibrutinib and
      radiation therapy may induce an immune response and prolong anti-tumor response.

      Primary Objective:

      Phase 1b: - To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of intratumoral SD 101 in
      combination with ibrutinib and radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell
      lymphoma . - To determine the safety and tolerability of SD 101 in combination with ibrutinib
      and radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma

      Phase 2: -To evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral SD 101 in combination with ibrutinib and
      radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma by assessing overall
      response rate

      Secondary Objective:

      Phase 2: - To evaluate progression free survival after treatment with intratumoral SD 101 in
      combination with ibrutinib and radiation in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell
      lymphoma

      - To evaluate the induction of tumor-specific immune responses by treatment with intratumoral
      SD-101 in combination with ibrutinib and radiation in patients with relapsed or refractory B
      cell lymphoma
