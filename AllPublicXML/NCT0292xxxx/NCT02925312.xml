  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Diabetes Institute (MDI), in partnership with key stakeholders-including Primary Care
      Providers- in a northeastern US regional, mixed-payer healthcare system), seeks to implement
      an evidence-based, technology-enabled, innovative, and integrated diabetes care management
      pathway (Boot Camp) for adult patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (A1C&gt;/=9%) which
      will demonstrate improvement in diabetes clinical and health resources utilization outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The program is designed to integrate type 2 diabetes specialty services into Primary
           Care practices to support PCPs and their patients in improving a spectrum of
           diabetes-related outcomes.

        -  High-risk patients from Primary Care practices who have uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and
           meet the target population inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to
           participate in an intensive and concise &quot;BOOT CAMP&quot; medication management and education
           intervention of ~4-8 weeks duration.

        -  The intervention will consist of three key components: (1) intensive, algorithm-based
           medication management (Appendix A), based on continuous review and management of blood
           sugars; (2) survival skills diabetes self-management education based on knowledge
           deficits identified on the KNOW Diabetes knowledge survey; (3) enhanced patient-provider
           communication, all provided by Endocrinologist supervised allied health professionals
           (in this instance CDEs).

        -  Survival skills DSME will focus on nutrition and meal plan basics, blood glucose
           targets, taking medications as prescribed, hyper- and hypoglycemia recognition and
           treatment, and when to seek medical help.

        -  The intervention is initiated with one to two face-to-face meetings with the CDE, at
           which the patient's readiness to change is assessed.

        -  These are followed by virtual meetings though a variety of media based on patient
           preference and health literacy (largely telephone and text messaging).

        -  Various technology tools are used to facilitate patient engagement, access and
           attainment of glycemic targets, including smart meters, virtual meeting platforms,
           web-based education content and surveys administration via tablets, etc.

        -  Near real-time transmission of blood glucose data using a cellular-enabled blood glucose
           monitoring system sends all glucose results to a web-based dashboard accessed daily by
           the Boot Camp educators.

        -  Concurrent matched charts of patients receiving standard care at the three MedStar
           locations will serve as a basis of comparison in assessing the impact of MDI on clinical
           and education outcomes and process of care.

        -  Based on patient progress towards improved glycemic control, the patient will 'graduate'
           from the program and the CDE will refer the patient back to their PCP in 8-12 weeks with
           a full report of medication changes, blood glucose readings and further diabetes
           management recommendations eg referrals; further DSME, etc.

            <groups_desc>The study was powered to detect a difference of 0.5 in the change in HbA1c with SD=2 with 80% power at alpha=0.05 with a sample size of 128 in each group (paired t-test). Differences in patient characteristics and the unadjusted differences in the outcome measures between the intervention and control groups were tested using linear mixed models, McNemar tests and conditional logistic models due to matching.</groups_desc>

        <title>Trend in the Composite Endpoint of All Cause ED Visits and Hospitalizations as Compared to the 6 Month Pre-intervention Period vs the 6 Months After the Start of the Intervention. This Was Measured for in Intervention and Concurrent Chart Controls.</title>
        <description>Health care utilization measure. We looked at the Incidence Rate Ratio of ED visits/hospitalizations for intervention and control patients to assess whether the pathway impacted the risk for ED visits/hospitalizations at 6 months from baseline. We looked at these measures for the 6-month period that preceded the baseline visit and the 6-month period that followed the baseline visit.</description>
