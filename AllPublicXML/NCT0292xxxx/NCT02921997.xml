      This is a single center, randomized, partially-blinded, Phase II, small, targeted,
      prospective study in approximately 30 healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects aged 18
      to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an
      intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine given with and without
      AS03 adjuvant, and an intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v
      virus vaccine. The primary objectives are (1) assessing the serum anti-HA
      hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without
      adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after the second study vaccination with A/H7N9
      vaccine with or without AS03) and influenza A/H3N2v antigen at Day 29 (approximately one
      month after the study vaccination with A/H3N2v), and (2) identifying differentially expressed
      genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 29 (following the first study vaccination with
      A/H7N9 vaccine with or without AS03) and on Days 30, 32, and 36 (following the second study
      vaccination with A/H7N9 vaccine with or without AS03), compared to baseline assessments
      performed prior to each study vaccination (Days -7, 1, and 29).

      to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity between an
      intramuscular monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi
      Pasteur given with and without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, and an
      intramuscular unadjuvanted monovalent inactivated influenza A/H3N2v virus vaccine
      manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. The primary objectives are (1) assessing the serum anti-HA
      hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) response to influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without
      adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after the second study vaccination with A/H7N9

      vaccination with A/H7N9 vaccine with or without AS03), compared to baseline assessments
      performed prior to each study vaccination (Days -7, 1, and 29). The secondary objectives are:
      (1) compare plasma cytokine and chemokine profiles at specific time points and between
      treatment arms at post vaccination points, (2) assess the neutralizing antibody responses to
      influenza A/H7N9 antigen (with and without adjuvant) at Day 57 (approximately one month after
      the second study vaccination with A/H7N9 vaccine with or without AS03) and influenza A/H3N2v
      antigen at Day 29 (approximately one month after the study vaccination with A/H3N2v vaccine),
      and (3) identify differentially expressed genes in human immune cells on Days 2, 4, and 8
      following one intramuscular dose of influenza A/H3N2v vaccine compared to baseline
      assessments performed prior to study vaccination (Day -7 and Day 1).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive.

          4. Are in good health*.

             *As determined by medical history and targeted physical examination, if indicated
             based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical
             diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days,
             that would affect the assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of
             study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the
             last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or
             frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition
             in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of
             health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons,
             as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the
             site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional
             risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not
             indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes
             subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no
             deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a
             medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with
             the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled
             medications (with the exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject
             Exclusion Criteria), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted.

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.4 degrees F.

          6. Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive.

          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mm Hg, inclusive.

          9. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour.

         10. Women of childbearing potential* must use an acceptable contraception method** from 30
             days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study vaccination.

             *Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or successful
             Essure (R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization) with
             documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure, and
             still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if menopausal.

             **Includes, but is not limited to, non-male sexual relationships abstinence from
             sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized
             partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving
             the first study vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with
             spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing (R), and licensed

             appropriate sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

             *An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining
             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess
             safety parameters as required by the protocol.

          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study
             participation*.

             *Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for at
             least 90 days that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render
             the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the
             evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this study.

          3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of
