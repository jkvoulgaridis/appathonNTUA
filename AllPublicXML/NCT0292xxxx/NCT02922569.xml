  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess
      the safety and efficacy of an experimental software program designed to improve cognitive
      functions versus a computer-based software control. Both the study and the software being
      investigated meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of combination of mindfulness
      training (MT) and adaptive cognitive training (CT) on the cognitive abilities, functional
      status and quality of life of soldiers and veterans diagnosed with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI, also referred to as a concussion, or blast exposure), as compared to a computer-based
      control.
