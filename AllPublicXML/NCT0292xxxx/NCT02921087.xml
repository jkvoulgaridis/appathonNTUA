      This study seeks to address whether or not different types of daily disposable soft contact
      lenses may be a beneficial option for patients complaining of eye strain and visual
      discomfort while using digital devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, single site, randomized, double-masked, crossover pilot study.
      Subjects were randomized to begin with either multifocal or single vision distance contact
      lenses. The lenses used in this study were the 1-Day Acuvue (AV) Moist spherical
      single-vision soft contact lenses (SSCL) in the 8.5 base curve and the 1-Day AV Moist
      Multifocal (MFSCL) in the low ADD (etafilcon A, 58% water content). The preferred viewing
      distance on digital devices for a similar age group to our study was 63 cm which would
      require a near ADD of +1.59D. A low addition (ADD) yielding up to +1.25D was selected to
      provide an intermediate near addition without compromising distance vision as much as would
      be expected with higher add powers. The multifocal lens utilizes an aspheric center-near
      design. Subjects wore the lenses on a daily wear, daily disposable schedule. Following one
      week (Â± 2 days) of lens wear, subjects were evaluated and the alternate lenses dispensed.
      Adverse events were collected and assessed at each study visit.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was change in average score on a ten question Visual Comfort Survey using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from baseline to day 7 in multifocal contact lenses and single vision contact lenses. The Visual Analogue Scale ranges from 0-100 (100 being the worst symptoms) for each of the ten questions. The maximum total score is 1000, the minimum total score is 0 (no symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Lag of Accommodation in Study Lenses</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Accommodative response was measured by having subjects switch the right lens to a spherical lens in the appropriate power. This was done for all subjects regardless of which lens they were randomized to, to maintain masking. Subjects wore an infrared filter over the right eye for occlusion and to ensure that they were fixating with the left eye (which was still wearing the lens they were randomized to). This filter allowed for measurements to be taken with the WAM-5500 open field autorefractor in front of the right eye. This method assumes a symmetrical accommodative response between eyes. Since accommodative response was measured monocularly, this eliminated any convergent accommodation, but this was consistent between lenses and test distances. Five measurements were taken at each test distance (distance, 40cm and 25cm). The 5 readings obtained were used to calculate mean spherical equivalent value at each test distance and compared to expected accommodative value to determine lag.</description>

        <title>Lag of Accommodation in Study Lenses</title>
        <description>Accommodative response was measured by having subjects switch the right lens to a spherical lens in the appropriate power. This was done for all subjects regardless of which lens they were randomized to, to maintain masking. Subjects wore an infrared filter over the right eye for occlusion and to ensure that they were fixating with the left eye (which was still wearing the lens they were randomized to). This filter allowed for measurements to be taken with the WAM-5500 open field autorefractor in front of the right eye. This method assumes a symmetrical accommodative response between eyes. Since accommodative response was measured monocularly, this eliminated any convergent accommodation, but this was consistent between lenses and test distances. Five measurements were taken at each test distance (distance, 40cm and 25cm). The 5 readings obtained were used to calculate mean spherical equivalent value at each test distance and compared to expected accommodative value to determine lag.</description>
