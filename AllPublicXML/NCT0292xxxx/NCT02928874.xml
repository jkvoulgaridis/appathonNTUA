  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using an integrated approach, this study examines multiple eating traits concurrently under
      states of hunger and satiety. It examines the impact of short-term appetite and intake
      regulation on longer-term energy intake control and weight development in a cohort of
      ethnically diverse normal-weight and obese boys and girls with different familial
      predispositions to obesity.
