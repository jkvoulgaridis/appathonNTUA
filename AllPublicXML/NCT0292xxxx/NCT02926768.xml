  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CK-101 is a novel, potent, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively
      targets mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while sparing wild-type
      (WT) EGFR. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety
      profile of oral CK-101; to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral CK-101; to assess the safety and efficacy of CK-101 in
      treatment-naive NSCLC patients known to have activating EGFR mutations and previously treated
      NSCLC patients known to have the T790M EGFR mutation.

      This is a first-in-human, two-part, open-label, safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy study
      of oral CK-101 administered daily in ascending doses in patients with advanced solid tumor
      cancer, followed by a Phase 2 portion at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in previously
      treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have documented evidence of EGFR
      T790M mutation and have failed treatment with a first-line EGFR inhibitor.
