  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy eating can be difficult for people who live in poor, geographically isolated regions
      of the United States. In particular, people who live in Appalachia often experience food
      insecurity (i.e., their access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money and other
      resources at times during the year) and lack of access to healthy foods. This pilot study
      evaluates the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in helping individuals who live in
      these austere regions improve their diets in the context of limited resources and healthy
      food availability

      Participants in three of the counties will receive an education/skills intervention paired
      with a form of coaching called motivational interviewing (MI) conducted by a trained
      registered nurse. Three similar counties that do not border any of the intervention counties
      are serving as controls (these counties receive the same nutrition education/skills
      intervention without motivational interviewing). All participants will receive cookbooks,
      cooking classes, food preparation tools, and prepared food dishes to take home to their
      families. The investigators will measure the impact of motivational interviewing on fresh
      fruit and vegetable consumption, saturated fat consumption and number of meals cooked at
      home.

    <measure>Change in BLOCK Fruit/Vegetable/Fiber Screener From Baseline at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Block Fruit/Vegetable/Fiber Screener is a tool that ranks usual intake of fruit, vegetables, and fiber. Total fruit/vegetable/fiber score can range from 0-50 with higher numbers reflecting greater frequency of fruit, vegetable and fiber consumption.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Saturated Fatty Acid Intake/Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the NCI DHQ II, respondents' frequency of consumption of foods (i.e., meats and oils) and portion size, dietary saturated fat consumption was calculated as average grams/day. Higher grams/day reflect higher consumption of saturated fatty acids.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Fast Food Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fast food consumption was measured using a single item on the National Cancer Institute Diety History Questionaire (NCI DHQ II) &quot;How often did you eat beef hamburgers or cheeseburgers from a fast food or other restaurant?&quot; Responses are selected from 11 pre-determined options increasing in frequency from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;2 or more times per day.&quot; Values range from 0 to 10; higher values indicate an increased frequency of fast food consumption.</description>
