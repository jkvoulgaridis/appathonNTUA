  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop and assess the effectiveness of a novel cognitive-functional intervention (FACoT)
      in occupational therapy for people after mild to moderate stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consequences of mild stroke include cognitive, emotional and functional difficulties that
      lead to decreased quality of life. In Israel most rehabilitation centers do not provide
      treatment to this population who generally are high-functioning.

      A single-blind-randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Adults after mild stroke living
      in community from &quot;Maccabi Health Services&quot; and &quot;shiba&quot; will be invited to participate in
      this study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: &gt; 18 years, at least three years post stroke,
      severity mild (NIHSS≤5), independent prior to the stroke, can understand and speak Hebrew,
      with no other neurological or psychiatric conditions, without dementia . Assessments will be
      administered pre and post the 10-week intervention and at follow-up 3-month later by
      assessors blind to the group allocation.

      Following the pre assessment, participants will be randomly allocated into two groups:
      treatment group will receive (FACoT) and the control group receiving standard care. Sample
      size: 60 patients -30 in each group.

      the treatment sessions will include: functional activities, cognitive activities and
      strategies (pencil-pen treatment), and behavioural strategies
