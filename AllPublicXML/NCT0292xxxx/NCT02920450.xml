    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug, Gedatolisib
      (PF-05212384), given in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin will work against
      unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70% of patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      receive and progress through frontline chemotherapy will be eligible for second line
      treatments. Any of the agents which are available for frontline therapy can be used in the
      salvage setting, though only erlotinib, docetaxel, and pemetrexed (in non-squamous cell
      carcinoma) are FDA-approved in the salvage setting based upon their demonstrated survival
      benefit in randomized phase III trials. All three appear to be roughly equivalent in terms of
      clinical benefit, which is admittedly modest, with response rates &lt;10%, clinical benefit
      rates of approximately 50%, and overall survivals of approximately 6 months. Still, a
      substantial number of patients may not benefit from the agents in the salvage treatment
      setting, thus it is critical to identify those patients who stand to benefit the most.

      The study will consist of two phases, Ib and II. The phase Ib portion will study dose
      escalations in separate 3+3 cohorts using escalating doses of PF-05212384. The phase II
      portion will consist of a two stage Simon design. The doses for paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, Q21
      days) and carboplatin (AUC=6, Q21 days) do not adjust as part of the study design. The dose
      of PF-05212384 will be determined during the Phase Ib portion.

      The primary endpoint of the phase Ib portion of this protocol is to determine a tolerable
      phase II dose of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The primary
      endpoint of the phase II portion of this study is to determine the objective response rate of
      disease to the administration of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.
      A secondary endpoint of this study will be progression-free survival following PF-05212384
      therapy.

    <description>To estimate the objective rate of response of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin administered to subjects with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, according to current RECIST criteria. ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieved either a partial or complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. By these criteria, Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and Partial Response (PR) is defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions.</description>

Gedatolisib: During the first phase, subjects will be sequentially enrolled to each increasing dose level, beginning with dose level 1 (110 mg) until the first dose limiting toxicity occurs, or safely accrued to dose level 3. PF-05212384 is intravenously infused over a thirty minute period.
Dose Level 1: 110 mg Dose Level 2: 150 mg Dose Level 3: 180 mg
Paclitaxel: Given as 200 mg/m2 infusion over a three hour period at every twenty-one days; the dose will not adjust as part of the study design.
Carboplatin: The carboplatin dose (mg) = AUC x (CrCl + 25) where AUC = 6 depending on the dose level. carboplatin is intravenously infused over a thirty minute period following paclitaxel administration; the dose will not adjust as part of the study design.</description>
