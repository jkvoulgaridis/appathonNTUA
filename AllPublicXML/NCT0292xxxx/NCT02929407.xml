  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) after intravenous (IV) administration of FE 204205 in patients with
      cirrhotic portal hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of IV FE 204205 in cirrhotic
      patients with portal hypertension and was planned in 2 parts:

      Part 1 of the trial was open‑label where six subjects were planned to receive three ascending
      doses of FE 204205, given as infusion over 2 hours on three consecutive days.

      Part 2 was planned as a randomised, placebo‑controlled, double‑blind investigation evaluating
      the effects of a single dose of FE 204205 on portal haemodynamics in 20 subjects who would
      have received either the maximum tolerated dose (as defined in Part 1) of FE 204205 (n=16) or
      placebo (n=4).

    <description>The trial was terminated early due to low recruitment. Only four subjects were enrolled into the open-label, exploratory Part 1 of the trial, and only three of these four subjects (all receiving different dosing regimens) completed the trial and the HVPG assessments prior to the early termination decision. No subjects were enrolled into the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Part 2 of the trial. As only Part 2 of the trial would have been appropriately powered, and the three subjects with HVPG assessments from Part 1 all received different dosing regimens, no meaningful statistical analysis could be conducted.</description>

        <description>The trial was terminated early due to low recruitment. Only four subjects were enrolled into the open-label, exploratory Part 1 of the trial, and only three of these four subjects (all receiving different dosing regimens) completed the trial and the HVPG assessments prior to the early termination decision. No subjects were enrolled into the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Part 2 of the trial. As only Part 2 of the trial would have been appropriately powered, and the three subjects with HVPG assessments from Part 1 all received different dosing regimens, no meaningful statistical analysis could be conducted.</description>

      <time_frame>AEs were recorded from obtaining the informed consent to the follow-up visit. In part 1 of the trial, AEs were recorded from obtaining the informed consent (up to 21 days before first administration of FE 204205) to the end-of-trial visit (between 7 and 14 days after first administration of FE 204205). Part 2 of the trial was never initiated.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. An AE could be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP.
Due to the low number of subjects and individual dosing regimens, AEs were pooled for all dose levels.</desc>
