  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of X4P-001 plus nivolumab is
      safe and tolerable. Secondly, the study will investigate if adding X4P-001 to nivolumab
      treatment has an effect on the body and the cancer tumor, in participants receiving nivolumab
      but not exhibiting a radiological response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Renal Cell Carcinoma with a documented clear
             cell component (ccRCC).

          -  Currently receiving nivolumab and considered by Investigator to have the potential to
             derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with nivolumab.

          -  Based on RECIST v1.1 criteria on current nivolumab treatment (prior to initiation of
             this study), has a best response of confirmed stable disease (SD) or confirmed
             progressive disease (PD). Confirmed SD or confirmed PD refers to a response that is
             confirmed by a second scan which is at least 4 weeks apart from the previous scan.

          -  At least one extra-renal measurable target lesion meeting the criteria of RECIST
             version 1.1.

          -  Agree to use contraception from screening, through the study, and for at least 5
             months after the last dose of nivolumab as follows: for women of childbearing
             potential agree to use highly-effective contraceptive methods; for males, agree to use
             a condom with sexual partner.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, uncontrolled hypertension, or
             clinically significant arrhythmia.

          -  Previously received X4P-001.

          -  Has a second malignancy. Except: malignancies that were treated curatively and have
             not recurred within 2 years prior to study treatment; completely resected basal cell
             and squamous cell skin cancers; any malignancy considered to be indolent and that has
             never required therapy; and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.

          -  Has active central nervous system (CNS) metastases (including evidence of cerebral
             edema by Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI], or progression from prior imaging study, or
             any requirement for steroids, or clinical symptoms of/from CNS metastases) within 28
             days prior to study treatment. Subjects with known CNS metastases must have a baseline
             MRI scan within 28 days of study treatment.

          -  Ongoing clinical adverse events National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
             for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade greater than (&gt;) 2 resulting from prior cancer
             therapies.

          -  Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immunodeficiency
             Syndrome (AIDS); or positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg).

          -  History of clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, or pulmonary
             disease.

          -  Has had within the past 6 months the occurrence of one or more of the following
             events: myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis,
             pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), chronic liver disease
             (meeting criteria for Child-Pugh Class B or C), or organ transplantation.

          -  Inadequate hematologic, hepatic, or renal function.
