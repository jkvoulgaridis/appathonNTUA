      Study RGX-104-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study of
      RGX-104, an oral small molecule targeting the liver X receptor (LXR), as a single agent and
      in combination with nivolumab, ipilimumab, docetaxel, or pembrolizumab plus
      carboplatin/pemetrexed. RGX-104 activates LXR, resulting in depletion of both myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as tumor blood vessels. MDSCs block the ability of T-cells
      and other cells of the immune system from attacking tumors.

      During the dose escalation stage, multiple doses and schedules of orally administered RGX-104
      with or without nivolumab, ipilimumab, docetaxel, or pembrolizumab plus
      carboplatin/pemetrexed (single agent or combination therapy) will be evaluated in patients
      with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or
      metastatic) who have had progressive disease (PD) on available standard systemic therapies or
      for which there are no standard systemic therapies of relevant impact. Dose escalation in
      combination with pembrolizumab plus carboplatin/pemetrexed will be restricted to patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      In the expansion stage of the study, additional patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma
      (EOC), NSCLC, or small cell lung cancer (SCLC)/high-grade neuroendocrine tumors (HG-NET) will
      be treated at the MTD (or maximum tested dose if no MTD is identified, or dose below the MTD
      if there is evidence suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile). This stage will
      provide further characterization of the safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics, including
      biomarkers of immunologic activity and LXR target activation, of RGX-104 as a single agent
      (EOC), in combination with docetaxel (SCLC/HG-NET), and and in combination with pembrolizumab
      plus carboplatin/pemetrexed (NSCLC).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have histologic or cytologic evidence of a malignant solid tumor or
             lymphoma (any histology) and must have advanced disease, defined as cancer that is
             either metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable (and for which additional
             radiation therapy or other locoregional therapies are not considered feasible).

          2. With the exception of dose escalation with pembrolizumab plus carboplatin/pemetrexed,
             patients enrolled in the dose escalation stages must have disease that is resistant to
             or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy, or for which there is no
             standard systemic therapy or reasonable therapy in the physician's judgment likely to
             result in clinical benefit or if such therapy has been refused by the patient.
             Documentation of the reason must be provided for patients who have not received a
             standard therapy likely to result in clinical benefit.

          3. Patients enrolled in the expansion stages must agree to a tumor biopsy to be obtained
             during the screening period and toward the beginning of Cycle 2 or at the time of PD,
             if earlier. If a biopsy is deemed by the investigator to not be in the patient's best
             interest, prior approval must be obtained from the Medical Monitor to waive this
             requirement.

          4. The patient must have disease that is measurable by standard imaging techniques per
             RECIST or immune-related response criteria (irRC; all tumor types except lymphoma) or
             International Working Group (IWG) revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma
             (lymphoma only). For patients with prior radiation therapy, measurable lesions must be
             outside of any prior radiation field(s), unless disease progression has been
             documented at that disease site subsequent to radiation.

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 ×
                  institutional ULN. Patients enrolled in an expansion stage may have ALT and AST &lt;
                  5 × institutional ULN if the patient has hepatic metastases;

               -  For patients not taking warfarin or other oral anticoagulants: international
                  normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 or prothrombin time (PT) ≤1.5 × ULN; and either
                  partial thromboplastin time or activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT or
                  aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN. Patients taking warfarin should be on a stable dose that
                  results in a stable INR &lt;3.5. Among patients receiving other oral anticoagulant
                  therapy, PT or aPTT must be within the intended therapeutic range of the
                  anticoagulant.

          8. The patient has adequate baseline hematologic function, as demonstrated by the
             following:

             duration of time on the study, and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods
             for 1 month after the last dose of study therapy. Patients receiving combination
             therapy must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of time on
             the study and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods for 6 months after the
             last dose of study therapy.

         12. The patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             procedures or treatment.

         13. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements, including follow-up for survival assessment.

         14. Tumor tissue (a minimum of 10 and up to 15 unstained slides, or paraffin block,
             ideally from the patient's most recent biopsy, must be made available prior to the
             first dose of study therapy.

                  first line setting.

               -  If the patient has platinum-sensitive relapsed disease (first relapse &gt; 6 months
                  from end of initial platinum therapy), the patient should have been re-treated
                  with platinum for relapsed disease (or be intolerant or have refused such
                  treatment).

               -  The patient may not have received treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors
                  (e.g., products that target PD-L1, PD-1, or CTLA-4).

               -  The patient must not have required a paracentesis within the preceding 4 weeks
                  nor be projected to require a paracentesis within the next 8 weeks.

               -  The patient must have histologic or cytologic evidence of newly-diagnosed
                  non-squamous, NSCLC that is advanced disease, defined as cancer that is either
                  metastatic (Stage 4) or locally advanced (Stage 3B) and unresectable.

               -  The patient has confirmation that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or

                  treatment with a platinum-based regimen and checkpoint inhibitor.

         17. For patients with SCLC enrolled in the docetaxel combination expansion stage:

               -  The patient must have a pathologically confirmed (by histology or cytology)
                  diagnosis of SCLC, which is currently extensive disease (disease outside a single
                  radiation port), or of metastatic neuroendocrine cancer with small cell or
                  high-grade features. Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine cancer with small
                  cell or high-grade features must have a pathology report supplied to the sponsor
                  before treatment.

               -  The patient must have demonstrated disease progression following platinum-based
                  chemotherapy with or without a PD-1/L1 inhibitor for SCLC, or following a
                  different, acceptable first-line regimen for high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.

               -  The patient must have received no more than 1 prior line of therapy for extensive
                  disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities (Grade ≥2) from previous
             anticancer therapy (excluding Grade 2 chemotherapy-related neuropathy and alopecia
             which are permitted). Prior toxicities that resulted in laboratory abnormalities
             should have resolved to Grade ≤1, unless a higher-grade abnormality is allowed by the
             inclusion criteria. If medical therapy is required for the treatment of a laboratory
             abnormality, the dose and laboratory value(s) should be stable.

          2. If considered for combination therapy with nivolumab or ipilimumab, the patient has:

               -  Uncontrolled clinically significant pulmonary disease.

               -  A history of Grade ≥3 immune-related adverse event regardless of offending agent.

               -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past. Patients
                  who have not required systemic treatment for at least two years may be enrolled
                  if permission is provided after discussion with the Medical Monitor (replacement
                  therapy, e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement
                  therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, is not considered a form of
                  systemic treatment, and is allowed).

               -  Evidence of active noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung
                  disease.

               -  A risk of reactivation of hepatitis B or C.

               -  Previously received an immune therapy that was discontinued due to immune-related
                  AEs, regardless of grade.

               -  Uncontrolled endocrine disorder. Patients who are on endocrine replacement
                  therapy must be on a stable dose.

          3. The patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, or
             other systemic anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to study therapy administration
             (42 days for prior nitrosourea or mitomycin-C; patients with advanced prostate cancer
             who are receiving luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are permitted
             onto the study and should continue use of these agents during study treatment).

          4. The patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent
             within 14 days prior to study therapy administration.

          5. The patient has previously received treatment with RGX-104 or another investigational
             agent that is a known LXR agonist.

          6. The patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of
             the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history with substantial potential
             for recurrence must be discussed with the Medical Monitor before study entry. Patients
             with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin
             cancer, carcinoma in situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical
             intraepithelial neoplasia, and melanoma in situ), organ-confined prostate cancer with
             no evidence of progressive disease.

          7. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or
             any New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 heart failure (see Appendix 1),
             uncontrolled angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke
             within 6 months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically
             significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication).

          8. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications
             during the study.

          9. The patient has known active or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Central
             Nervous System (CNS) imaging is not required prior to study entry unless there is a
             clinical suspicion of CNS involvement. Patients with stable, treated brain metastases
             are eligible provided there is no evidence of CNS disease growth on imaging for at
             least 8 weeks following radiation therapy or other locoregional ablative therapy to
             the CNS.

         10. The patient has a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids
             (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within

             uncontrolled infection requiring therapy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

         12. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

         13. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus or active or

             patient is taking a statin but discontinuation is considered appropriate, the statin
             must be discontinued at least 5 days prior to starting study therapy.

         20. The patient requires treatment with a medication that is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4

             ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, or voriconazole).

         21. For the docetaxel escalation stage, patients with NSCLC with alkaline phosphatase &gt;
             2.5 × institutional ULN and AST or ALT &gt; 1.5 × institutional ULN.

             combination dose escalation or expansion stages:

               -  The patient received radiation therapy to the lung that is &gt;30 Gray (Gy) within 6
                  months of the first dose of study medication

               -  The patient completed palliative radiotherapy ≤7 days of the first dose of study
                  medication

               -  The patient has received live-virus vaccination ≤30 days of planned start of
                  study medication

               -  The patient has clinically active diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess,
                  gastrointestinal obstruction, peritoneal carcinomatosis

               -  The patient is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while
                  on study.

               -  The patient is unable to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal
                  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other than an aspirin dose ≤1.3 g per day, for
                  a 5-day period (8-day period for long-acting agents, such as piroxicam)

               -  The patient is unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12
                  supplementation

         23. The patient has clinical or laboratory evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
