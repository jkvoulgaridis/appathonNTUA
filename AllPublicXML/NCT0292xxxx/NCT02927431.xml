  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Danirixin (DNX) is a novel, selective, and reversible antagonist of the C-X-C chemokine
      receptor (CXCR) 2 and has been shown to decrease neutrophil transmigration and activation to
      areas of inflammation. An intravenous (IV) formulation of DNX hydrobromide (HBr) is being
      developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of adults hospitalized with influenza
      (IFV). While early therapy with antivirals decreases severity and duration of symptoms of
      influenza, there are no drugs that have demonstrated clinical efficacy in randomized clinical
      trials in this population. Current treatment guidelines for hospitalized IFV recommend
      neuraminidase inhibitors as standard of care therapy. IFV studies in animals have
      demonstrated that therapeutic treatment with the combination of a CXCR2 antagonist and a
      neuraminidase inhibitor reduced lung neutrophils and showed trends for improvements in
      clinical scores, lung function and pathology with no evidence of worsening outcomes,
      including viral load. This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind (for IV DNX), placebo-controlled
      (for IV DNX) 3-arm study will be the first study to determine the efficacy and safety of IV
      DNX when co-administered (in all groups) with standard of care antiviral treatment
      (open-label oral oseltamivir [OSV]) in subjects hospitalized with IFV. The primary objective
      of the study is to assess the efficacy of treatment with IV DNX twice daily given with oral
      OSV compared to oral OSV twice daily on time to clinical response (TTCR). In this study,
      subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 15 milligram (mg) free base equivalent (FBE)
      IV DNX, 50 mg FBE IV DNX, or matching placebo twice daily. All subjects will also receive
      open-label 75 mg oral OSV, twice daily (given as standard of care). The study treatment
      duration will be for up to 5 days. The investigator may elect to continue treatment with OSV
      after 5 days of study treatment. Follow up will continue until Day 45 for all subjects. The
      study will begin with enhanced safety monitoring in sentinel cohorts, leading to stepwise
      enrollment of subjects. Subjects will be enrolled based on increasing levels of renal
      impairment, and less severe hospitalized subjects will be enrolled prior to enrollment of
      critically ill subjects, as this is the first study conducted in the hospitalized population
      with severe IFV. Approximately 300 subjects are targeted to be enrolled in the study.

             contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until at
             least 36 hours (five half-lives) after the last dose of study medication. 1) Vasectomy
             with documentation of azoospermia 2) Male condom plus partner use of one of the
             contraceptive options below: Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or
             intrauterine system; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone;
             Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches

          -  For females, non-reproductive potential defined as: 1) Pre-menopausal females with one
             of the following: Documented tubal ligation; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion; Hysterectomy;
             Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy 2) Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause
             (refer to laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels)]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. 3) Reproductive potential and agrees
             to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods
             for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from the first dose
             of study medication until at least 36 hours after the last dose of study medication
             and completion of the post treatment (PT) Day 3 visit. The investigator is responsible
             for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of
             contraception.

      <recruitment_details>This was a randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Danirixin (DNX) co-administered with a standard-of-care antiviral (oseltamivir [OSV]), in the treatment of adults hospitalized with influenza. The study enrolled participants in 7 centers across 3 countries (Romania,Sweden and United States) and was terminated due to poor enrollment</recruitment_details>

        <description>The clinical response was defined as Hospital discharge due to clinical improvement OR normalization of temperature; and oxygen saturation; and respiratory status/heart rate/systolic blood pressure (normalization of 2 out of these 3 parameters). The clinical response based on vital signs/ventilation status required 24-hour confirmation. Considering 2-hour assessment window, the response confirmation period was 22 hours. Kaplan Meier estimates for the median of TTCR was provided. One participant had vital sign resolution at Baseline and was counted as having a clinical response but was not included in the Kaplan Meier Estimates. Influenza Positive Population (IPP) Population comprised of all participants in the Intent to Treat Exposed (ITT-E) Population with influenza infection (positive influenza Polymerase Chain Reaction [PCR] or culture at any time point) confirmed by central lab testing. Only those participants with data available at the indicated time point were analyzed.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate T. Bilirubin, creatinine and D. Bilirubin at indicated time points. Values at Day 1 were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline at each visit was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from post-dose visit value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates data is not available.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate ALT, AST and ALP at indicated time points. Values at Day 1 were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline at each visit was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from post-dose visit value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indicates data is not available.</description>
