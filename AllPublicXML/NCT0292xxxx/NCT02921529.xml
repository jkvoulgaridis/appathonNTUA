    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint
      stimulation(TEAS) on postoperative recovery after laparoscopic colon surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to two groups, receiving TEAS andno stimulation respectively.
      Interventions were given 30min before anesthesia and 1, 2 , 3 day after surgery, lasted 30min
      each time . The acupoints of TEAS group are bilateral ST36/SP6 combined with PC6/LI4, and the
      control group only attach electrodes without electric current. The frequency of TEAS is set
      to 2/10 Hz. After surgery, the time of meeting discharge criteria, first flatus and
      defecation were recorded. Score of PONV, life quality, sleep quality and VAS of pain were
      evaluated 24, 48 and 72h after surgery. The postoperative complications, re-exploration, cost
      of hospitalization and adverse events were also recorded.
