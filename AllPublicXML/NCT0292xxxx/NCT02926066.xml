  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial expansion is to offer patients, who are not enrolled into the Phase I/II
      trial, a chance of treatment, to provide the experience in this gene therapy, and to increase
      the dose slightly.

      AAV2-hAADC will be made by a GMP laboratory. An MRI will be performed to define the brain
      structure, and then metal nails will be fixed on the skull and a CT will be performed. The
      two images will be confined and the direction and depth of infusion will be determined.
      During the surgery, a stereotactic device will be implanted on both sides of the brain on a
      bur hole. Each putamen will be injected for two times. If there is no complication from the
      surgery, the patients will enter the follow up period.

      In Cohort 1, subjects for high dose (2.37x1011 vg) will be enrolled via sequential enrollment
      with an observation for 2 months or even longer. Only after a subject passing peak
      dyskinesia, which is indicated by a reduced drug dose required for alleviation of dyskinesia,
      or improved food intake, and being verified by Safety Committee, treatment for the next
      patient with high dose can be proceeded.

      In Cohort 2, in order to be compared with Phase I/II (n=10), 4 patients will be treated in
      Cohort 2 and all of them will use the high dose (2.37x1011 vg). Patients older than 3 (no
      more than 2 patients) years of age will be enrolled via sequential enrollment with an
      observation for 2 months or longer. Only after a subject passing peak dyskinesia, which is
      indicated by a reduced drug dose required for alleviation of dyskinesia, or improved food
      intake, which has been verified by the Safety Committee can the treatment at a high dose
      begin in the next patient older than 3.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. With a confirmed diagnosis of AADC, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis to show
             reduced levels of neurotransmitter metabolites, HVA and 5-HIAA, and higher L-Dopa, or
             with more than one mutation within AADC gene, etc.

          2. Classical clinical characteristics of AADC deficiency, such as oculogyric crises,
             hypotonia and developmental retardation.

          3. The child patient has to be over 2 years old or a thickness of skull enough for
             surgery.
