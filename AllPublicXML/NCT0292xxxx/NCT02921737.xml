    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, sequentially enrolling single arm phase II trial to
      evaluate the activity of TAS-102 in previously treated metastatic and locally advanced
      unresectable pancreatic cancer after progression through or intolerance to first or second
      line chemotherapy. Trial therapy will consist of TAS-102 (Lonsurf®) 35 mg/m2 to be given
      orally twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 with cycles repeating every 28 days. The primary
      endpoint is to determine the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with unresectable
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria

          -  Metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease. Subjects without clear evidence
             of distant metastatic disease will be presented at multidisciplinary tumor board for
             discussion of disease resectability.

          -  Refractory or intolerant to 1 or 2 prior regimens of standard chemotherapy for
             metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer

          -  TAS102 will be planned to start after disease progression on first-or second line
             chemotherapy, provided any prior chemotherapy-related toxicities have resolved to less
             than or equal to Grade 1 or baseline within 28 days of the date the subject signs the
             informed consent form. Grade 2 or greater toxicities including alopecia, skin
             pigmentation,and platinum induced neurotoxicity/neuropathy are acceptable for starting
             on trial, as these toxicities do not preclude treatment with TAS102

          -  Capacity to understand and sign the informed consent document

          -  Able to take medications orally

             informed consent form, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the

          -  Adequate bone marrow function:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/mm3
