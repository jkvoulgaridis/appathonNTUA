  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether evolution of resting energetic expenditure
      is a predictive marker of tumoral response for patients suffering from metastatic pancreatic
      cancer and treated with 1st line of chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Protocol is not adapted to cancer pancreas disease as progression is very fast and patients
    stopped the study before 1st study assessment
