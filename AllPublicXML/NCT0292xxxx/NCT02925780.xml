      microabrasion in the improvement of dental fluorosis.

    <textblock>
      Dental fluorosis is an endemic public health concern that develops if infants are subjected
      to excessive amounts of fluoride during enamel formation. Anatomopathologically, dental
      fluorosis presents itself as a hypermineralized surface layer and subsurface
      hypomineralization involving the external third of the thickness of the enamel, which is
      equivalent to early carious lesions. In addition, fluorosis features a number of clinical
      changes in the enamel surface, ranging from the appearance of thin white lines up to severe
      structural defects, thereby compromising overall esthetics, which sometimes leads to children
      dropping out of school due to its psychological impact.

      The aim of this controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of enamel microabrasion
      and resin infiltration in improving the dental esthetic of patients with fluorosis. Resin
      infiltration is a microinvasive technique that can improve the esthetics by infiltrating a
      low-viscosity resin (that has a similar refractive index to enamel) into the porose
      hypomineralized enamel of fluorosed white spots. This approach thus largely preserves the
      enamel compared to more invasive techniques such as microabrasion and has been shown to be
      efficient in previous studies.

      This study will be conducted in the provinces of Pichincha and Cotopaxi, Ecuador and patients
      between 10 to 12 years of age with stage 1, 2, and 3 fluorosis according to the Thylstrup and
      Fejerskov (TF) scale or questionable, very mild, and mild fluorosis according to Dean's Index
      will be recruited. In addition to the immediate esthetic improvement, long term stability of
      the outcome will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months.

    <description>The labial surface of fluorosed teeth (upper front teeth) that are selected for this group will be treated using the resin infiltrant &quot;Icon&quot; (DMG, Germany). This is a minimally invasive treatment to improve the aesthetics by masking the white spots.</description>

    <description>The labial surface of fluorosed teeth (upper front teeth) that are selected for this group will be treated by microabrasion using the microabrasive material &quot;Opalustre&quot; (Ultradent, USA).

    <description>Teeth selected for this group will be treated with the resin infiltrant Icon according to the manufacturer's instructions. In short, teeth will be isolated with a rubber dam and the labial tooth surface cleaned with non-fluoride prophylactic paste and pumice. After an etching and drying step (to open the lesion surface), Icon will be applied following the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently light cured, followed by polishing.
Digital images are taken before and after the treatment as well as at the follow-up visits (3, 6, 9 and 12 months).</description>

    <description>The labial surfaces of teeth selected for this group will be isolated and precleaned. Subsequently, the microabrasive material, Opalustre, will be applied according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a rubber cup at low speed (5 times each for 5 seconds). Between each of the applications the surface is washed by flushing water using a syringe.
