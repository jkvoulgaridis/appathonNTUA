  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the possibilities of early and precise management to
      decrease portal vein pressure in cirrhotic patients, guided by a non-invasive
      3D-virtual-model of hepatic portal system (3D-vHPS). Healthy volunteers are enrolled to
      determine the normal range of pressure density in different sites of HPS. Cirrhotic patients
      without visible gastro-esophageal varies by endoscopy are randomly enrolled to virtual portal
      vein pressure gradient (vPVPG) monitored or non-vPVPG monitored groups. Non-vPVPG groups are
      followed-up and treated according to Baveno V consensus in portal hypertension. Patients in
      vPVPG-monitored groups are followed-up by anatomic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and
      Doppler ultrasound every six months. Once vPVPG is above 12mm of mercury (Hg), participants
      will receive carvedilol treatment. All cirrhotic patients are followed-up with the incidence
      of portal hypertension-related complications, mortality rate and life quality assessment.

    <textblock>
      The non-invasive 3D-HPS is a newly-developed test to determine vPVPG based on anatomic
      computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and Doppler ultrasound. In this study, vPVPG is
      determined by the 3D-HPS.

    <description>Healthy volunteers are enrolled as controls to get a normal range of pressure gradient in different sites of hepatic portal system (HPS), such as portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, inferior mesenteric vein and splenic vein. All enrolled healthy subjects should undergo anatomic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and Doppler ultrasound for only one time, to rebuild a 3D-vHPS by computer.</description>
