  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, 2 arm study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of
      GSK2879552 alone, or in combination with azacitidine in subjects with MDS. The study
      consisted of 2 parts. The objective of Part 1 is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of GSK2879552 administered alone and in combination with azacitidine in adult subjects
      with high risk MDS previously treated with HMA. The objective of Part 2 is to evaluate
      clinical activity after treatment with GSK2879552, alone or in combination with azacitidine,
      in adult subjects with high risk MDS previously treated with HMA.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label, 2 arm study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of GSK2879552 alone, or in combination with azacitidine in adult participants with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The study was conducted in 3 centers among 2 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 5 participants were included into Part 1 and received GSK2879552. The study was terminated during Part 1 and hence Part 2 was not conducted as the risk benefit in earlier studies do not favor continuation of this study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Part 2 was to be initiated once Part 1 is completed and dose has been selected for GSK2879552 monotherapy and combination of azacitidine with GSK2879552. Treatment with GSK2879552 in this combination therapy arm was to be administered orally once a day at RP2D as continuous daily dosing in each cycle (of 28 days) until disease progression in Part 2 of the study. Azacitidine was to be administered at 75 milligram per meter^2 on Days 1-7 of each 28 day cycle by intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous (SC) injection (route of administration: by physicians choice).</description>

Treatment with GSK2879552 in this combination therapy arm was to be administered orally once a day at RP2D as continuous daily dosing in each cycle (of 28 days) until disease progression in Part 2 of the study. Azacitidine was to be administered at 75 milligram per meter^2 on Days 1-7 of each 28 day cycle by intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous (SC) injection (route of administration: by physicians choice).</description>
