  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single centre study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an experimental stannous
      fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) after short term
      use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, three day, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm,
      parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected
      test teeth), controlled study, in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet
      all the criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) visits. DH will be assessed at
      baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and after 3 days twice daily use.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each of the two test tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows: 0 Participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus, 3 Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. The Schiff sensitivity score was calculated as the average of individual test teeth score. Change from baseline in Schiff sensitivity was calculated as participant level mean change from baseline of the 2 test teeth. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score was indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile threshold was assessed by examiner using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe) which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface from 10 gram[g] to an upper threshold of 80g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied at which participant do not report any pain or discomfort. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 3</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each of the two test tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows: 0 Participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus, 3 Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. The Schiff sensitivity score was calculated as the average of individual test teeth score. Change from baseline in Schiff sensitivity was calculated as participant level mean change from baseline of the 2 test teeth. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score was indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

          <population>Analysis for this outcome was performed on ITT population, defined as all participants who were randomized, received the study treatment at least once and provided at least one post-baseline (post treatment) assessment.</population>
