      This is a non-randomized, open label, sequentially enrolling phase II study with a Simon
      two-step enrollment design to evaluate the activity of TAS-102 in previously treated
      unresectable or metastatic squamous non-small cell cancer after progression through or
      intolerance to prior systemic therapy. The trial therapy of TAS-102 is to be administered
      orally at 35 mg/m2 each dose twice daily. The primary objective of the trial is to determine
      the progression-free survival, in months, of subjects receiving TAS 102 for the treatment of
      unresectable or metastatic recurrent squamous non-small cell lung cancers.

    <description>To determine the percentage of subjects who achieve an objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieved either a partial or complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. By these criteria, Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and Partial Response (PR) is defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions. Subjects must have received at least 2 cycles of therapy to be evaluable for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>To determine the percentage of subjects who derive clinical benefit by RECIST 1.1 criteria. The clinical benefit rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete or partial response or stable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines a partial response as a decrease of the sum of the largest diameter each target lesion by at least 30%. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (except lymph nodes, whose short axis must measure 10 mm or less). By RECIST 1.1 criteria, a subject is considered to have stable disease when the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions has neither decreased enough to qualify as a partial response not increased enough to qualify as progressive disease.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who will be eligible will be all patients with unresectable and/or metastatic
             squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer who have disease which has been previously
             treated with an Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)- or National Comprehensive Cancer
             Network (NCCN)-approved platinum doublet. Patients who have not received such therapy
             must have medical reasons for not receiving such therapy. Those who have a molecularly
             targetable genetic mutation in their tumor must have also received the appropriate
             specific therapy for that mutation. All will be appropriate candidates for
             chemotherapy treatment.

        Subjects must meet all of the additional following criteria to be eligible for study
        participation:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Male or female' age &gt;18 years

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must be using an effective means of contraception.

          -  Histologic diagnosis of squamous non-small cell lung cancer that has been treated
             adequately in the metastatic or unresectable setting with a platinum doublet
             chemotherapy regimen and now has evidence of disease progression. Patients may have
             also received additional chemotherapy, such as an immune checkpoint inhibitor or no
             more than one additional cytotoxic agent (thus participants may have received between
             one to three prior lines of therapy for metastatic or unresectable disease).

          -  Patients who have received platinum-based doublet therapy in the neoadjuvant or
             adjuvant setting will only be eligible if they have experienced disease progression
             after their last dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients who have a neoplasm for which there currently exists an FDA-approved targeted
             therapy (such as to epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] activating mutations, or
             ALK or ROS1 gene rearrangements) must have received all such targeted therapies and
             either exhibited progressive disease through such treatments, or have been shown to be
             intolerant of such therapies, prior to enrollment on this study.

          -  Baseline laboratory values (bone marrow, renal, hepatic):

          -  Adequate bone marrow function:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/µL

          -  Platelet count &gt;100'000/µL

          -  Serum calcium &lt; 12 mg/dL

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 6 months after
             the last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy. Prior to study
             enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of
             avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an
             unintentional pregnancy. WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who
             has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal. Post-menopause is
             defined as:

          -  Amenorrhea that has lasted for ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or

          -  For women with irregular menstrual periods who are taking hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT), a documented serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of greater than 35
             mIU/mL.

          -  Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             physician-approved contraceptive methods (e.g., abstinence, condoms, vasectomy)
             throughout the study and should avoid conceiving children for 3 months following the
             last dose of study drug.

          -  Subjects must have provided written informed consent and be willing to comply with all
             study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a mixed histology NSCLC, such as adenosquamous carcinoma, where the
             squamous component is &lt;50% of the assessed lesion

          -  Patients with a mixed histology where there are any small cell elements

          -  Patients who have not received and progressed through, refused, or been intolerant of,

        <description>To determine the percentage of subjects who derive clinical benefit by RECIST 1.1 criteria. The clinical benefit rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete or partial response or stable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines a partial response as a decrease of the sum of the largest diameter each target lesion by at least 30%. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (except lymph nodes, whose short axis must measure 10 mm or less). By RECIST 1.1 criteria, a subject is considered to have stable disease when the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions has neither decreased enough to qualify as a partial response not increased enough to qualify as progressive disease.</description>
