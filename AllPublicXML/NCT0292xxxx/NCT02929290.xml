    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of BPI-9016M in patients with c-Met-dysregulated advanced NSCLC.Biomarkers
      related to the efficacy of BPI-9016M will be investigated.

      This study was a multicenter, open, single-arm, Ib-stage expanded clinical study. On the
      basis of Ia-stage dose escalation study, a safe and effective dose of -300 mg, 450 mg, 600 mg
      and 800 mg was selected to enlarge the enrollment study in patients with c-Met-dysregulated
      advanced NSCLC, and continuously administered until the disease progressed or could not be
      tolerated, in order to further evaluate the safety, ttolerability, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of BPI-9016M.
