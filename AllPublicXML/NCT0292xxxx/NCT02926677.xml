  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine three treatment conditions for traumatized youth:
      Cue-Centered Treatment (CCT), Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), and
      Treatment as Usual (TAU) to determine which treatment works most effectively for which youth.
      The investigators would like to determine feasibility of training on the treatment
      interventions. In addition, this study aims to inform development of systems of care for
      chronically traumatized youth.

      The investigators hope to determine whether 1) TF-CBT and CCT will have better outcomes than
      TAU, 2) Child characteristics predict better outcome in either TF-CBT or CCT and to identify
      which phases of treatment are most effective, and 3) Imaging findings will be predictors of
      improved outcome. This research is important because while there are many existing trauma
      interventions for youth, little is known about what is most essential in those interventions.
      This study will shed light on what components of treatment are most effective. Furthermore,
      there are minimal guidelines on how to select the most appropriate intervention for a
      particular child. This study will contribute to that knowledge by informing which
      interventions are suited best for which youth.

      The children will be referred from Stanford Youth Solutions and University of California, San
      Francisco. Caregivers will undergo a telephone screening according to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Written consent for participation will be obtained from participants,
      parents and/or legal guardians. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three
      treatment conditions: TF-CBT, CCT, or TAU. Assessments will be administered at 4 time points:
      1) pre-treatment, 2) mid-therapy, 3) post-treatment, and 4) three month follow-up. A
      medical/developmental history form will be completed only pre-treatment. The UCLA PTSD
      Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) parent and child versions will be used to assess exposure to
      traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Given that trauma has high comorbidity
      with depression and anxiety disorders these symptoms will be assessed using the
      Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).
      Executive functioning will be assessed by both child and parent report using the Behavioral
      Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF).

      In addition, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) will be conducted at each of these
      time points to assess tasks of working memory, response inhibition, and facial recognition.
      The investigators will be using the NIRScout which is a portable NIRS recording unit. NIRS
      technology uses specific wavelengths of light, introduced at the scalp, to enable the
      noninvasive measurement of changes in the relative ratios of deoxygenated hemoglobin
      (deoxy-Hb) and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) in the capillary beds during brain activity.

    <description>The UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-V is a 31 item self-report measure with child and caregiver versions. It screens for exposure to traumatic events and assesses the frequency of occurrence of PTSD symptoms in the past month on a scale of 0-4 (caregivers also have the option of responding &quot;I don't know to frequency of occurrence). The items map onto the DSM-V criteria for PTSD as well as assessing for dissociative subtype.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at session 7 (=mid-treatment), session 15 (=end treatment), and 3 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CDI 2 is a 28 item self-report measure that assesses depressive symptoms in the past two weeks. A total score is obtained as well as scores for subscales of negative mood, negative self-esteem, interpersonal problems, anhedonia, and ineffectiveness.T-scores of 65 and above are considered within clinical range.</description>

    <description>The MASC 2 is a 50 item self-report measure assessing anxiety on a scale of 0-3. It obtains a total score and anxiety probability score as well as scales for separation anxiety/phobias, social anxiety, generalized anxiety index, OCD, physical symptoms and harm avoidance. There is also a measure for inconsistency in responses. T-scores of 65 and above are considered in the clinical range.</description>

    <description>The BRIEF is an 80 item measure (86 for caregivers) that assesses impairment in executive function with symptoms rated as occurring &quot;Never,&quot; &quot;Sometimes,&quot; or &quot;Often.&quot; There are 8 clinical scales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials, Monitor) and two validity scales (Inconsistency and Negativity). The clinical scales form two broader Indexes (Behavioral Regulation and Metacognition) and an overall score, the Global Executive Composite. T-scores of 65 and above are considered in the clinical range.</description>
