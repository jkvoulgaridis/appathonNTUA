      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MicroVention
      Flow Redirection Intraluminal Device (FRED) system when used in the treatment of wide-necked
      intracranial aneurysms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with complete occlusion of the target aneurysm and ≤50% stenosis of the parent artery and an alternative treatment of the target Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) had not been performed within 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint has three components: 1) complete occlusion of the target aneurysm assessed by a core laboratory utilizing the Raymond Scale 2) ≤ 50% stenosis of the parent artery at the target (IA) using the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease(WASID) criterion which is defined as greater than 50% luminal loss, 3) alternative treatment of the target IA is defined as re-treatment of the target aneurysm with an alternative treatment modality including open repair, endovascular placement of an additional stent or treatment of In-stent Stenosis observed. The Raymond scale has 3 responses, where Grade I is complete occlusion, no flow of contrast seen in the sac, Grade II is partial occlusion, some flow in the neck or sac, and Grade III is incomplete occlusion, apparent flow into the sac.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants who experience neurological death or major ipsilateral stroke measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A major stroke is defined as a new neurological event that persists for &gt; 24 hours and results in a ≥ 4 points increase in the NIHSS score compared to baseline or compared to any subsequent lower score. A major ipsilateral stroke is defined as that occurring within the vascular distribution of the stented artery. Neurologic death is defined as a death which has been adjudicated by the independent clinical events committee to have directly resulted from a neurologic cause.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with complete occlusion of the target aneurysm on 12-month angiography (Raymond 1)</measure>

    <description>Complete occlusion of the target aneurysm assessed by a core laboratory utilizing the Raymond Scale</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of ≥ 50% In-Stent Stenosis (ISS) at the target Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) at 12 months as assessed by angiography at the independent Core Laboratory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stenosis of the parent artery at the target IA using the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) criterion which is defined as greater than 50% luminal loss</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants in whom an unplanned alternative treatment of the target IA had not been performed within 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Re-treatment of the target aneurysm with an alternative treatment modality including open repair, endovascular placement of an additional stent or treatment of In-stent Stenosis observed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with clinically acceptable (90-100%) occlusion of the target aneurysm, ≤ 50% stenosis of the parent artery at the target IA, and an unplanned alternative treatment of the target IA had not been performed</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint has three components: 1) clinically acceptable occlusion of the target aneurysm assessed by a core laboratory as percent occlusion (90%-100%) 2) ≤ 50% stenosis of the parent artery at the target IA using the WASID criterion which is defined as greater than 50% luminal loss, 3) alternative treatment of the target IA is defined as re-treatment of the target aneurysm with an alternative treatment modality including open repair, endovascular placement of an additional stent or treatment of In-stent Stenosis observed. The Raymond scale has 3 responses, where Grade I is complete occlusion, no flow of contrast seen in the sac, Grade II is partial occlusion, some flow in the neck or sac, and Grade III is incomplete occlusion, apparent flow into the sac.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of FRED system and procedure related serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event is any medical experience regardless of its relationship to the study treatment that occurs during participant enrollment in this trial that results in any of the following: (1) inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization; (b) persistent or significant disability or incapacity; (c) death of the study participant, or (d) necessitates an intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. Procedure related events were associated with the index procedure, antiplatelet therapy, or follow up angiography.</description>
