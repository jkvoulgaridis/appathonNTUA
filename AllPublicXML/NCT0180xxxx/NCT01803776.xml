    <textblock>
      The Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) Study is a single-centre controlled
      trial on the effects of a combined physical activity and dietary intervention on
      cardiometabolic risk factors and other health outcomes in a population sample of children
      from the city of Kuopio, Finland. The study provides novel scientific information for the
      identification of cardiometabolic diseases and other chronic diseases since fetal period and
      for the prevention of these chronic diseases since childhood.

      The main hypothesis of the PANIC study is that individuals at increased risk of
      cardiometabolic diseases and other chronic diseases can be identified in childhood and that
      it is possible to start the prevention of these chronic diseases by a long-term physical
      activity and dietary intervention since childhood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate a population sample of 512 children from the city of Kuopio, Finland. The
      children will be recruited in 2007-2009 when they are 7-9 years of age and when they will
      start the first grade in primary schools of the city of Kuopio. The children will be
      allocated to the combined physical activity and dietary intervention group and the control
      group after baseline examinations carried out in 2007-2009. The intervention group will
      undergo individualized and family-based physical activity and dietary intervention, including
      six intervention visits, for two years. All children from the intervention and control group
      will be invited to 2-year follow-up examinations carried out in 2009-2011 when they are 9-11
      years of age. The intervention group will continue with a less intensive physical activity
      and dietary intervention until 8-year follow-up examinations carried out in 2015-2017 when
      the participants are 15-17 years of age. The participants from the intervention and control
      group will continue with an open follow-up until 14-year follow-up examinations in 2021-2023
      when they are 21-23 years of age. All of these study phases will include comprehensive and
      detailed assessments of behavioral, biological, environmental, and genetic risk factors for
      cardiometabolic diseases and other chronic diseases. The results of the PANIC Study will help
      in 1) decreasing the risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases and other chronic diseases
      since childhood by increasing physical activity, decreasing sedentary time, and improving
      diet, 2) identifying children and adolescents at increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases
      and other chronic diseases who would benefit most from the physical activity and dietary
      interventions, 3) targeting children and adolescents, particularly those at increased risk of
      cardiometabolic diseases and other chronic diseases, for more careful health examinations,
      physical activity and dietary interventions, and health follow-up, and 4) preventing
      cardiometabolic diseases and other chronic diseases as well as their societal consequences in
      adulthood.

    <description>The physical activity and dietary intervention is based on the Finnish physical activity and dietary recommendations. The children and their parents in the intervention group undergo individualized and family-based physical activity and dietary intervention between the baseline and 2-year follow-up examinations. The children and their parents meet a physical activity specialist and a nutritionist who give detailed and individualized instructions on health promoting physical activity and diet at months 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 with a specific topic at each visit. Between the 2-year follow-up and 8-year follow-up examinations, the intervention continues with yearly physical activity and dietary counseling sessions. The children in the intervention group, particularly those who do not attend organized sports or exercise, will also be encouraged to participate in after-school exercise clubs organized by trained exercise instructors of the study.</description>
