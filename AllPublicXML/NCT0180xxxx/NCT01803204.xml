  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness in the use of an educational material through: Assessment of
      knowledge about post-operative orthognathic surgery; assessing levels of anxiety with the
      survey of Anxiety Inventory-STATE-TRAIT; clinical evaluation of self-care in the management
      of postoperative signs and symptoms
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a clinical randomized controlled trial being developed from February 2013 to September
      2015, divided into two phases: a pilot study without randomization for impact testing and
      evaluation of intervention and, in the second time, the clinical randomized study with
      possible changes after the pilot study.

      Will be entered in the study patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery originating at
      outpatient clinic located in the municipality of São Paulo. The study aims to evaluate the
      effects of educational material in postoperative education orthognathic surgery, with
      intervals between pre and postoperative serials.

      Recruitment plan of patients: the patients seen in oral and maxillofacial surgery and
      traumatology clinic located in the municipality of São Paulo with indication for orthognathic
      surgery will be covered by personally and invited to participate in intervention research. To
      control the bias will be included in the study patients of the same surgical team, to ensure
      the same surgical technique and postoperative guidance conduct by the surgeon.

      Study variables: it is intended to analyse the socio-demographic variables: sex, age, level
      of education; independent variables: surgical technique, recovery time, difficulties
      experienced during the postoperative period, possible surgical complications; dependent
      variables: signs and symptoms postoperatively (presence or absence) and monitoring of care
      during the postoperative period; level of knowledge about the post-op of orthognathic surgery
      and anxiety levels (State-trait anxiety inventory-IDATE).

    <time_frame>this measure will be assessed weekly in the first forty days postoperatively (seventh day, fourteenth day, twenty-first day and fortieth day after the surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>A review of the patient's recovery after surgery will occur during follow-up visits with the surgeon, It was rated the care of oral hygiene, nutrition, mobility and sensitivity, appearance of lips, swelling, pain and sleep . The patient will be accompanied by the researcher during the return and the data will be evaluated and investigated as annotated patient outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Average Test Arrangements on Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be delivered in the first contact with the patient before surgery and on the seventh day after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's knowledge about the surgery will be assessed by a test developed by the researcher (A test with 10 multiple choice questions, each questions with 4 alternatives, about care after surgery. Each questions value 1 point, for better results was considered higher 7 points and for worse results was considered low 5 points. A total value for the Knowledge test was 10 points (rage 0-10) The acceptable score to understand that the patient is aware of the surgery was 7.
This was applied on two occasions: first contact with the patient before surgery, signed a consent form before the start researcher educational intervention (during the preoperative phase).
The second test will be given at the first follow-up visit with the surgeon (seventh postoperative day)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Levels of Anxiety After Educational Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>The STAI will be applied on the seventh day after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of anxiety during the perioperative period will be measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
The STAI has 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety sub-scales Responses for the S-Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Responses for the T-Anxiety scale assess fre- quency of feelings &quot;in general&quot;: 1) almost never, 2) some- times, 3) often, and 4) almost always.
Scoring. Item scores are added to obtain subtest total scores. Scoring should be reversed for anxiety-absent items (19 items of the total 40).
Score interpretation. Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the S-Anxiety scale For results this intervention was considered S-STAI Anxiety with lower scores (&lt; 39) after the intervention</description>

Each questions value 1 point, for better results was considered higher 7 points and for worse results was considered low 5 points. A total value for the Knowledge test was 10 points (rage 0-10) The acceptable score to understand that the patient is aware of the surgery was 7.

        <title>Levels of Anxiety After Educational Intervention</title>
        <description>The levels of anxiety during the perioperative period will be measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
The STAI has 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety sub-scales Responses for the S-Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Responses for the T-Anxiety scale assess fre- quency of feelings &quot;in general&quot;: 1) almost never, 2) some- times, 3) often, and 4) almost always.
Scoring. Item scores are added to obtain subtest total scores. Scoring should be reversed for anxiety-absent items (19 items of the total 40).
Score interpretation. Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the S-Anxiety scale For results this intervention was considered S-STAI Anxiety with lower scores (&lt; 39) after the intervention</description>
        <time_frame>The STAI will be applied on the seventh day after surgery</time_frame>
