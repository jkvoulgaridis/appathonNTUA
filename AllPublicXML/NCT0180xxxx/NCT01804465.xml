  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects taking ipilimumab, as an immediate or
      delayed treatment, following completion of sipuleucel-T (SipT) treatment, has on patients and
      their prostate cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining SipT with
      ipilimumab in patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve metastatic castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC).

      All patients will be treated with standard SipT (Q2wks x 3). Patients will be randomized to
      one of two arms:

      Arm 1 (Immediate Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 1 day following the final dose of
      SipT (Day 0).

      Arm 2 (Delayed Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 3 weeks following the final dose of
      SipT (Day 0).

      Following this ipilimumab treatment, patients will then be followed monthly for 3 months and
      then quarterly until disease progression. The definition of unacceptable toxicity is grade 3
      or higher treatment-related toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4) excluding immune-related adverse events
      (irAEs). The study will assess for the immunogenicity and clinical activity of sequential
      sipuleucel-T treatment followed by ipilimumab. Patients who experience an initial clinical
      response to ipilimumab followed by subsequent disease progression will be offered reinduction
      treatment with ipilimumab.

    <time_frame>Up to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immune response will be tested using the single sample binomial exact test when induction therapy is completed. The Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses to PAP and PA2024 will be assessed by ELISA assay at baseline and week 20 after start of sipT treatment (day 113 of study treatment). A positive response is defined as a titer &gt; 1:400. The primary hypothesis is tested by comparing the proportion of patients achieving an IgG immune response to PAP or PA2024 to the null hypothesis of 15% (based off an observed anti-PAP IgG response rate of 17.7% seen at a similar time interval in patients treated w/ sipuleucel-T. The same single sample test will be performed for IgM antibodies. The positive immune proportion for both IgG and IgM antibodies to PAP and to PA2024 with 95% confidence intervals will be used to summarize the results for each study arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of highest grade toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be reported for each study arm at each dose of ipilimumab administered with descriptive statistics (e.g. proportions) by tabulating the frequency of the maximum grade occurring for each patient for each type using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0 criteria. As described above the type and grade of all such Immune Response Adverse Events (IRAEs) will be tabulated by treatment arm. Toxicity results will be presented indicating occurrences during the first 20 weeks of protocol therapy and those occurring later.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be calculated to characterize the proportion of patients achieving a PSA decline of at least &gt;30% and &gt;50% and presented along with the 95% confidence intervals for each study arm. The proportion of patients achieving an objective response will also be determined. Descriptive statistics will be presented for each study arm to summarize response according to important disease features such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (abnormal vs. normal) and prior treatment (radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy (RP), systemic steroid usage &gt; 3 months).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to PSA progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize time to PSA progression. The Kaplan-Meier product limit will be used to estimate the probability of time to PSA progression with durations measured from the start of protocol therapy. For each study arm the median time to progression with 95% confidence intervals will be presented to summarize clinical efficacy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed, metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (positive bone scan
             and/or measurable disease on CT scan and/or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis).

          2. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation, as defined by PSA Working Group 2
             and/or RECIST criteria. Patients must have disease progression by one or both of the
             following:

               -  For patients with measurable disease, progression is defined as at least a 20%
                  increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions or the
                  appearance of one or more new lesions, as per RECIST criteria version 1.1.

               -  For patients with no measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA
                  will be required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA
                  level of at least 2 ng/milliliter (mL), which has risen on at least 2 successive
                  occasions, at least 1 week apart. If the confirmatory PSA value is not greater
                  than the screening PSA value, then an additional test for rising PSA will be
                  required to document progression.

               -  If no prior orchiectomy has been performed, patients must remain on luteinizing
                  hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist (e.g. degarelix) therapy.
                  Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of primary androgen ablation
                  must demonstrate disease progression following discontinuation of the
                  antiandrogen, defined as two consecutive rising PSA values, obtained at least two
                  weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue progression. At least one of
                  the PSA values must be obtained at least four weeks (flutamide) or six weeks
                  (bicalutamide or nilutamide) after discontinuation.

          3. Laboratory requirements:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ‚â• 1500/ŒºL

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Hemoglobin ‚â• 8 g/dL

               -  PSA ‚â• 2 ng/mL

               -  Platelets ‚â• 100,000/ŒºL

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or
                  equal to 2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine clearance ‚â• 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft Gault equation

               -  Testosterone less than or equal to 50 ng/dL

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 1 and life expectancy
             ‚â• 12 weeks.

          5. At least 18 years of age or older.

          6. Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate
             (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g.
             Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES), or any systemic corticosteroid, must discontinue the agent for
             at least four weeks prior to study treatment. Progressive disease as defined above
             must be documented after discontinuation of any hormonal therapy (with the exception
             of a LHRH agonist).

          7. Prior radiation therapy must be completed ‚â• 4 weeks prior to enrollment and the
             patient must have recovered from all toxicity. Prior radiopharmaceuticals (strontium,
             samarium) must be completed ‚â• 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          8. Because of the unknown potential risk to a gamete and/or developing embryo from these
             investigational therapies, patients must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier
             method for males) for the duration of study participation, and for three months after
             discontinuing therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the exception of neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy, because of the potential effect of chemotherapy on the immune system.

          2. Prior sipuleucel-T treatment or investigational immunotherapy.

          3. Prostate cancer pain requiring regularly scheduled narcotics.

          4. Current treatment with systemic steroid therapy (inhaled/topical steroids are
             acceptable). Systemic corticosteroids must be discontinued for at least 4 weeks prior
             to first treatment.

          5. History of autoimmune disease including, but not limited to:

               -  Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), scleroderma, CREST syndrome, rheumatoid
                  arthritis
