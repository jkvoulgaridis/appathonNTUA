    <textblock>
      The probability to achieve CR with R-chemotherapy in patients failing a rituximab containing
      first line regimen is quite low, in particular in cases with non GCB profile. The bioCORAL
      trial suggest that ABC subset have a dismal outcome whichever the induction treatment. Thus
      it can be argued the addition of new molecule to the RDHAP regimen could be of value.
      Bortezomib appears the best candidate in this setting as ABC subtypes constitutively express
      NFkb, which is the target of bortezomib itself. Data from the literature suggest an
      encouraging activity of R-chemo+ bortezomib in non GCB-derived DLBCL, although in small
      series. Thus, the addition of bortezomib is here justified by the need to circumvent
      constitutional resistance to chemotherapy. Published experience of the association between
      bortezomib and cytarabine are also encouraging with acceptable cumulative toxicity.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, two-arm randomized phase II screening trial34 in young
      patients (18-65 years) affected by relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
      at diagnosis, eligible to high-dose therapy.

      Aim of the study is to to assess whether the addition of Bortezomib to R-DHAP is more
      promising than standard R-DHAP, as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy with ASCT
      with respect to response and safety. Patients will be randomized at first relapse between: a)
      the standard salvage therapy Rituximab in association to DHAP every 28 days (R-DHAP) for 4
      cycles and b) Bortezomib in association to the same regimen (BR-DHAP). In both arms the
      induction therapy is followed by autologous stem cell transplantation or, if indicated, by
      allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      A patient is considered evaluable if it is possible to assess response by PET after 4 cycle
      or, if a patient withdraws from the study for PD, before completion of study treatment.

      After providing written informed consent, patients will be evaluated for eligibility during a
      21-day screening period. If they continue to meet eligibility criteria, they will be
      randomized to receive the first dose of BR-DHAP or R-DHAP .
