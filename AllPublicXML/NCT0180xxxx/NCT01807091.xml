    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of having induction chemotherapy in an
      outpatient setting. Patients with acute leukemia (AML) or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), at least 18 years of age will be examined. Treating eligible patients with induction
      chemotherapy in an outpatient setting may save in healthcare cost and improve a patients'
      quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of outpatient induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by examining whether &gt; 50% of patients treated as
      outpatients can complete chemotherapy without being admitted to hospital or &lt; 5% of patients
      die within 14 days of beginning outpatient chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive outpatient induction chemotherapy.
