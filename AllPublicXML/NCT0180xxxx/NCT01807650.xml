  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this phase III clinical trial was to show safety and efficacy of
      Oleogel-S10 in accelerating the wound healing of Split-Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) donor
      sites.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oleogel-S10 has shown efficacy and was well tolerated in previous clinical trials in
      participants with skin lesions. Especially the results in a previous study with STSG donor
      sites suggested that Oleogel-S10 should be efficacious and safe in the treatment of
      superficial wounds.

      The present phase III clinical trial in STSG donor sites was initiated to demonstrate wound
      healing progress, i.e., the time to healing and the grade of epithelialization of the wound.

      In this study, STSG donor sites were separated into 2 wound halves. Randomly assigned, 1
      wound half was treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing, the other wound half
      with non-adhesive wound dressing only (standard of care).

      Wound healing progress was documented by photos which were assessed by expert reviewers
      blinded to the treatment of the wound halves.

    <measure>Intra-individual Difference in Time to Wound Closure</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves, either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with non-adhesive wound dressing only. Independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological series of cropped and coded photographs by wound half that were taken before start of treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment. Difference in time to wound closure was calculated for every individual participant as [time taken for wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 to close] - [time taken for wound half treated with non-adhesive wound dressing to close], i.e., results below 0 indicate earlier wound closure of Oleogel-S10 treatment. The overall mean difference in time to wound closure was calculated based on all mean differences in time to wound closure of individual participants. Hence, primary outcome data derived from mean difference in time to wound closure by participant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time From Surgery Until Wound Closure is Achieved</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time from surgery until wound closure is achieved, separately for wound halves treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing vs. non-adhesive wound dressing only. While outcome measure 1 (intra-individual difference in time to wound closure) was calculated based on mean intra-individual difference in time to wound closure in 110 participants with missing values replaced by a value of 0, for outcome measure 2 missing values were not replaced. For 2 of the 110 wounds data were missing, thus the reported values are calculated from 108 STSG donor site wound halves by intervention (Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing vs. non-adhesive wound dressing only).</description>

             trial site for wound dressing change and photo documentation every third or fourth day
             until both wound halves were closed (but no longer than 28 days after surgery).

          <description>Intra-individual comparison: A split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site wound ≥15 cm² in size was divided in 2 halves. One half was randomized to Oleogel-S10 treatment and non-adhesive wound dressing, the other half to non-adhesive wound dressing only. Non-adhesive wound dressings, specifically soft silicone faced polyurethane foam dressings (e.g., Mepilex®), represent standard of care (SOC) in the treatment of STSG donor site wounds. Oleogel-S10 was administered at a thickness of 1 mm (0.04 inches) and wound dressings were changed at least every 3 to 4 days. Study treatment continued until both wound halves were closed (at least 95% epithelialised) or ended at Day 28.</description>

        <description>Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves, either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with non-adhesive wound dressing only. Independent experts were blind to treatment and assessed efficacy based on chronological series of cropped and coded photographs by wound half that were taken before start of treatment, during wound dressing changes and at the end of treatment. Difference in time to wound closure was calculated for every individual participant as [time taken for wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 to close] - [time taken for wound half treated with non-adhesive wound dressing to close], i.e., results below 0 indicate earlier wound closure of Oleogel-S10 treatment. The overall mean difference in time to wound closure was calculated based on all mean differences in time to wound closure of individual participants. Hence, primary outcome data derived from mean difference in time to wound closure by participant.</description>

        <title>Likert Scale Rating of Tolerability</title>
        <description>Participants and investigators were asked to evaluate the tolerability of Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing versus non-adhesive wound dressing only (standard of care) on a 5-point Likert scale (treatment with Oleogel-S10 is much better tolerated, treatment with Oleogel-S10 is better tolerated, both treatments are equally well tolerated, non-adhesive wound dressing only is better tolerated, non-adhesive wound dressing only is much better tolerated).</description>

        <population>The safety analysis population (SAF) included all participants who received treatment at least once, i.e. who received any dose of Oleogel-S10 or standard of care (SOC). If the application of any treatment was uncertain, the participant was included in the SAF.</population>
