    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with advanced
      systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab
      vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to
      grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them

    <textblock>
      Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody with a covalently attached toxin. The antibody portion
      targets the protein CD30 on the surface of cells, and the toxin acts against those cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate to SGN-35 (brentuximab vedotin) in patients with tumor
      necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8 (CD30+) advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM)
      (ASM or mast cell leukemia [MCL] with or without an associated hematological clonal non-mast
      cell lineage disease [AHNMD]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of SGN-35 in patients with SM.

      II. To evaluate expression of CD30 on neoplastic mast cells before and during therapy with
      SGN-35.

      III. To evaluate changes in mastocytosis related symptom scores and quality of life (QOL)
      using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPNSAF).

      IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) and time to response (TTR). V. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 1 year and
      then every 12 weeks thereafter.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per Consensus International Response Criteria (Rate of Complete or Partial Remissions or Clinical Improvement)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is sum of complete response (CR); partial response (PR); and clinical improvement (CI) in 1 year, ie, ORR=CR+PR+CI. The outcome is the number of participants without dispersion.
CR is following with response duration(RD) ≥12 weeks (wk)

Neutrophils ≥1x10e9/L with normal differential
Hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL
Platelets ≥100x10e9/L
No hepatosplenomegaly
No systemic mastocytosis(SM)-related organ damage PR is following with RD ≥12wk
Neither CR or progressive disease(PD)
Neoplastic mast cells reduced ≥50%
Tryptase reduced ≥50%
1+ disease finding resolved CI is following with RD ≥12wk
Neither CR; PR; or PD
1+ of findings above Stable disease (SD) Not CR, PR, Cl, or PD Progressive disease (PD)
Any of:
Worsening organ damage
Doubling of laboratory abnormality
New transfusion dependence of ≥4 units red cells or platelets at 8wk

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brentuximab Vedotin Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity was assessed as the number of adverse events considered possibly, probably, or definitely-related to treatment with brentuximab vedotin. The outcome is reported as the total number of related events, a number without dispersion, and the number of related events (without dispersion) considered to be either a hematologic toxicity or non-hematologic toxicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change of CD30 Expression on Neoplastic Mast Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of the CD30 marker (epitope) on neoplastic (cancerous) mast cells in core bone marrow biopsy samples was assessed by immunohistochemical methods, before and after brentuximab vedotin treatment. CD30 is a member of the TNF-receptor (TNF-R) superfamily, and is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that is normally at very low levels on the surface of activated T-cells. Overexpression of the CD30 marker is indicative of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and neoplastic mast cells, and the effect of a particular treatment on CD30 expression may be related to the efficacy of that treatment. The outcome is reported as the median percentage change in the level of CD30 detected, reported with full range.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) Total Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical effect of patient symptoms associated with systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia were assessed with the patient-reported outcome survey entitled Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form with Mast Cell Disorder Symptoms [(MPN-SAF(MCD)]. The MPN-SAF(MCD) is a 36-question survey, with possible responses ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating not present or no effect; 1 meaning present but most favorable; and 10 meaning worst imaginable (least favorable). Total range is 0 to 360, with 0 being best possible, and 360 being worst possible. Total symptom score is calculated as the sum of the individual survey scores reported at baseline and after treatment, with lower numbers indicating less effect, and larger numbers indicated greater effect. The outcome is reported as mean score value with dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) Score Using a Modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Overall quality of life (QoL) was assessed by a single specific question from the 36-question Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form with Mast Cell Disorder Symptoms [(MPN-SAF(MCD)] survey. Possible responses for theQoL question range from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating &quot;as good as it can be&quot; (most favorable), and 10 meaning &quot;as bad as it can be&quot; (least favorable). The QoL score was obtained at baseline and after treatment. The outcome is reported as mean score with dispersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the start of the first confirmed response until the date of the first documented and confirmed disease progression or death due to ASM or MCL. For participants with a confirmed clinical response, the outcome was to be reported as the median DOR with standard deviation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of first confirmed response. For participants with a confirmed clinical response, the outcome was to be reported as the median TTR with standard deviation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment until disease progression; death; or initiation of new therapy. The outcome is reported as the mean number of days of PFS, with 95% confidence interval.
Progressive disease (PD) is any of the following:
Worsening of any organ damage
Doubling of any laboratory abnormality
New transfusion dependence of ≥ 4 units red cells or platelets at 8 wk

        <title>Percent Change of CD30 Expression on Neoplastic Mast Cells</title>
        <description>The presence of the CD30 marker (epitope) on neoplastic (cancerous) mast cells in core bone marrow biopsy samples was assessed by immunohistochemical methods, before and after brentuximab vedotin treatment. CD30 is a member of the TNF-receptor (TNF-R) superfamily, and is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that is normally at very low levels on the surface of activated T-cells. Overexpression of the CD30 marker is indicative of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and neoplastic mast cells, and the effect of a particular treatment on CD30 expression may be related to the efficacy of that treatment. The outcome is reported as the median percentage change in the level of CD30 detected, reported with full range.</description>

        <description>The clinical effect of patient symptoms associated with systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia were assessed with the patient-reported outcome survey entitled Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form with Mast Cell Disorder Symptoms [(MPN-SAF(MCD)]. The MPN-SAF(MCD) is a 36-question survey, with possible responses ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating not present or no effect; 1 meaning present but most favorable; and 10 meaning worst imaginable (least favorable). Total range is 0 to 360, with 0 being best possible, and 360 being worst possible. Total symptom score is calculated as the sum of the individual survey scores reported at baseline and after treatment, with lower numbers indicating less effect, and larger numbers indicated greater effect. The outcome is reported as mean score value with dispersion.</description>

        <description>Overall quality of life (QoL) was assessed by a single specific question from the 36-question Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form with Mast Cell Disorder Symptoms [(MPN-SAF(MCD)] survey. Possible responses for theQoL question range from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating &quot;as good as it can be&quot; (most favorable), and 10 meaning &quot;as bad as it can be&quot; (least favorable). The QoL score was obtained at baseline and after treatment. The outcome is reported as mean score with dispersion.</description>
