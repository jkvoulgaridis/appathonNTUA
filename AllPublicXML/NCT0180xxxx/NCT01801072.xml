  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a thorough review of the existing literature as well as a review of our own practice,
      the investigators have concluded that the decision to treat patients undergoing aneurysm
      repair with levetiracetam has reached true clinical equipoise. In other words, the
      investigators cannot favor a decision to either administer or not administer this drug in
      these patients based on the existing information. The utility of anti-epileptic prophlaxis in
      the perioperative period for patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm repair remains a
      common practice that is not supported by the current literature that includes retrospective
      analyses as well as prospective trials for similar but not identical types of patients. The
      investigators propose to settle this dilemma by performing a prospective randomized trial in
      patients undergoing aneurysm repair in order to definitively determine if the common practice
      of perioperative antiepileptic drug administration has any utility.
