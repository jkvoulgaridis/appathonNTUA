  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of alectinib in participants with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation
      and failed crizotinib treatment. In Part 1, cohorts of participants will receive escalating
      doses of alectinib orally twice daily. In Part 2, participants will receive the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of alectinib as determined in Part 1. Treatment will continue in Part 1
      and Part 2 on the same dose until disease progression. In Part 3, following disease
      progression, participants without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation will be
      offered continued treatment with alectinib, participants with EGFR mutations will be offered
      a combination of alectinib and erlotinib.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Overall study status was confirmed as completed. Here, 'study terminated by sponsor' in reason for study not completed means participants were transitioned to commercial supply of alectinib (where it was available) or transitioned to a roll-over study BO39694 (NCT03194893) where they continued to receive alectinib treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Part 1 of study was planned to determine recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of alectinib to be used in Part 2. During the conduct of Part 1 for this study, RP2D was confirmed in Study NP28761 (NCT01871805). Hence Part 1 participants were merged into Part 2. Part 3 was post-progression treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by IRC according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Objective response was defined as percentage of participants with a CR or PR that was confirmed by repeat assessments &gt;/=4 weeks after initial documentation.

PR was defined as &gt;/=30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline SoD). The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>DoR was defined as the time from the first observation of an objective tumor response (CR or PR) until first observation of progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause. CR: disappearance of all target, non-target lesions; normalization of tumor marker level; and reduction in all lymph nodes size to &lt;10 mm. PR: &gt;/=30% decrease in the SoD of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline SoD). PD: &gt;/=20% relative increase and &gt;/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SoD, taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded since treatment started; 1 or more new lesion(s); and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Duration of response was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. Participants who did not progress or die after a confirmed objective response were censored at the date of their last tumor assessment.</description>

Tumor response was assessed by the investigator and IRC according to RECIST v1.1.

PD: &gt;/=20% relative increase and &gt;/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SoD, taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded since treatment started; 1 or more new lesion(s); and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SoD while on study. The 95% CI was computed using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
