  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VeClose pivotal study was a controlled, randomized, prospective, multicenter, pivotal
      study in which patients with venous reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV) were treated
      with either the VenaSeal closure system (VenaSeal SCS) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the VeClose study was to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the VenaSeal
      SCS as being both 1) non-inferior to RFA therapy in achieving anatomical closure of lower
      extremity superficial truncal veins in patients with venous reflux through endovascular
      transcatheter embolization with coaptation of the GSV at 3 months, and 2) superior in the
      reduction of intraprocedural and post procedural pain and symptoms as compared to treatment
      with RFA.

      The study was designed to demonstrate safety of the VenaSeal SCS by follow-up visits that
      evaluated, via duplex ultrasound and physical exam, the presence of deep vein thrombosis
      and/or pulmonary embolus.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Closure of the Target Vein at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was complete closure of the target vein at 3 months after index treatment as judged by the vascular ultrasound laboratory. Complete closure was defined as Doppler ultrasound examination showing closure along the entire treated vein segment with no discrete segments of patency exceeding 5 cm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During the operative procedure, which was an average of 24 minutes for VenaSeal SCS, 19 minutes for RFA, and 31 minutes for Roll-in group.</time_frame>
    <description>After the procedure, pain experienced during the procedure was rated by the subjects on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 represents no pain whatsoever and 10 represents worst imaginable pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ecchymosis at Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>First follow up visit at day 3</time_frame>
    <description>At the Day 3 visit, the investigator visually rated the subject's ipsilateral leg for the occurrence of ecchymosis along the treated area based on a Scale for Ecchymosis Assessment with a 0-5 rating scale, with 0 being the best possible outcome and 5 being the worst possible outcome.
The treatment area was defined as the area of skin overlying the treated vein, excluding the 5 cm of skin immediately adjacent to the access site.
The rating scale was based on the percentage of ecchymosis of the treated area according to the following criteria:
0 rating = no ecchymosis,
rating = less than 25% ecchymosis,
rating = 25-50% ecchymosis,
rating = 50-75% ecchymosis,
rating = 75-100% ecchymosis,
rating = extension of ecchymosis above or below the treated area.</description>

        <description>At the Day 3 visit, the investigator visually rated the subject's ipsilateral leg for the occurrence of ecchymosis along the treated area based on a Scale for Ecchymosis Assessment with a 0-5 rating scale, with 0 being the best possible outcome and 5 being the worst possible outcome.
The treatment area was defined as the area of skin overlying the treated vein, excluding the 5 cm of skin immediately adjacent to the access site.
The rating scale was based on the percentage of ecchymosis of the treated area according to the following criteria:
0 rating = no ecchymosis,
rating = less than 25% ecchymosis,
rating = 25-50% ecchymosis,
rating = 50-75% ecchymosis,
rating = 75-100% ecchymosis,
