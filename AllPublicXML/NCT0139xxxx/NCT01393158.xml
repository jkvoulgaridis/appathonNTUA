    <measure>Change in EASI Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change in EASI score measured at Baseline and Month 3, (if on 20mg arm) or Baseline and Month 6 (if on 30mg arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The eczema area and severity index (EASI) is a composite score measuring physical signs of atopic dermatitis. The scale ranges from 0-72. The components measuring severity are four signs/symptoms of atopic dermatitis: erythema, population, excoriation and lichenification on a scale of 0-3 for each body of the four body regions (head/neck, trunk, arms, legs). The component measuring area is a body surface area measurement of each region. The area and severity of each body region is weighted based on size of region which are added together for the complete score. The score for each patient's with scores between 0 and 7 are considered mild ,between 7 and 21 are considered moderate, and greater than 21 are considered severe. In this study the change in EASI score between baseline and month three (end of study) in the 20 mg arm and month six in the 30 mg arm, baseline EASI score was subtracted from month 3 or month 6 score in the 30mg arm,and calculated as a final outcome data point.</description>

    <time_frame>Mean change in IGA score measured at Baseline and Month 3, (if on 20mg arm) or Baseline and Month 6 (if on 30mg arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator global assessment scale is a gestalt global assessment made by an investigator describing the overall disease severity of the patient. It is a categorical scale that includes 0-clear, 1-almost clear, 2-mild,3- moderate, 4-severe, and 5-very severe. The reduction in IGA score from baseline to month three (end of study) in the 20mg arm and month six (end of study) in the 30mg arm was evaluated for efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pruritus (Visual Analog Scale) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change in Pruritus (Visual Analog Scale) score measured at Baseline and Month 3, (if on 20mg arm) or Baseline and Month 6 (if on 30mg arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) is a 10 cm (100 mm) visual analog scale that measures up patient's itch severity with 10 (100 mm) representing the worst imaginable and 0 representing no itch. This is a validated scale with a change of three from baseline to month three in the 20mg arm (end of study) and month six in the 30mg arm (end of study) being clinically relevant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change In DLQI Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change in DLQI scores measured at Baseline and Month 3, (if on 20mg arm) or Baseline and Month 6 (if on 30mg arm)</time_frame>
    <description>The dermatology life quality index (DLQI) is a validated quality-of-life scale that measures the impact of skin disease. It is a 10 question instrument. Scores of 0 over 0-1 means there is no effect on the patient's life. Scores between 2 and 5 represent a small effect on patient's life. Scores between 6 and 10 correspond to a moderate effect on patient's life. Scores between 11 and 20 correspond to a very large effect on the patient's life. And scores between 21 and 30 correspond to an extremely large effect on patient's life. The range of the scale between 0 and 30 for the added total of the patient's responses. Each question can be answered on a scale of 0-&quot;not at all&quot;, 1-&quot;a little&quot;, 2-&quot; a lot&quot;, 3- &quot;very much&quot; with some questions having the option of &quot;not relevant&quot;. The difference in DLQI score from baseline to month three (end of study) in the 20mg arm and month six (end of study) in the 30mg arm was evaluated for efficacy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease severity of Moderate, Severe, or Very Severe by Investigator Global
             Assessment.

          -  Disease severity must be greater than or equal to 6 on the Rajka-Langeland Severity
             Scoring system corresponding to moderate-severe disease.

          -  Baseline EASI score must be greater than or equal to 11. A previous validation study
             for the EASI scoring system revealed patients with moderate to very severe disease had
             mean EASI scores ranging from 11-30.

        <title>Change in EASI Scores</title>
        <description>The eczema area and severity index (EASI) is a composite score measuring physical signs of atopic dermatitis. The scale ranges from 0-72. The components measuring severity are four signs/symptoms of atopic dermatitis: erythema, population, excoriation and lichenification on a scale of 0-3 for each body of the four body regions (head/neck, trunk, arms, legs). The component measuring area is a body surface area measurement of each region. The area and severity of each body region is weighted based on size of region which are added together for the complete score. The score for each patient's with scores between 0 and 7 are considered mild ,between 7 and 21 are considered moderate, and greater than 21 are considered severe. In this study the change in EASI score between baseline and month three (end of study) in the 20 mg arm and month six in the 30 mg arm, baseline EASI score was subtracted from month 3 or month 6 score in the 30mg arm,and calculated as a final outcome data point.</description>

        <title>Change In DLQI Scores</title>
        <description>The dermatology life quality index (DLQI) is a validated quality-of-life scale that measures the impact of skin disease. It is a 10 question instrument. Scores of 0 over 0-1 means there is no effect on the patient's life. Scores between 2 and 5 represent a small effect on patient's life. Scores between 6 and 10 correspond to a moderate effect on patient's life. Scores between 11 and 20 correspond to a very large effect on the patient's life. And scores between 21 and 30 correspond to an extremely large effect on patient's life. The range of the scale between 0 and 30 for the added total of the patient's responses. Each question can be answered on a scale of 0-&quot;not at all&quot;, 1-&quot;a little&quot;, 2-&quot; a lot&quot;, 3- &quot;very much&quot; with some questions having the option of &quot;not relevant&quot;. The difference in DLQI score from baseline to month three (end of study) in the 20mg arm and month six (end of study) in the 30mg arm was evaluated for efficacy.</description>
