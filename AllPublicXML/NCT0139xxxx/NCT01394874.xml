  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-report measure of exercise adherence over the last 3-months on a numeric rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise adherence was assessed by the single self-report item &quot;How would you rate your level of adherence to the prescribed BOOST exercise program, over the last 3 MONTHS?&quot; Participants selected a number from 0 (not at all) to 10 (completely as instructed). Higher scores reflect better adherence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24 -month change in self-report of pain and function using the WOMAC index</measure>
    <time_frame>post the 1-month exercise class, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in/out of a car, shopping, putting on/taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in/out of bath, sitting, getting on/off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties Responses to individual questions [between 0 (extreme) and 4 (None)] are summed to a raw score ranging from 0 (worst) to 96 (best) and then normalized to a WOMAC Score of between 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The difference in pain and function subscale values between the measures following the exercise class and the 24-month follow-up were used for secondary outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in quadriceps strength from baseline to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic quadriceps strength will be assessed with a Biodex</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Physical Function tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in timed physical function task over 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Timed physical function tasks will include a timed get up and go, timed stair ascent and descent, and a 5 and 10 chair stand time. We will examine the association of adherence, as a dichotomous and continuous variable, to change in timed physical function using logistic and linear regression, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Average measure of exercise quality over 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome will be assessed at the end of the 24 month follow-up period as the number of calendar periods (1 month per calendar period) that the participant exercises at least half the number of prescribed sessions (a minimum of 6 out of 12 over a 4 week period) with the agreed upon level of intensity.</description>
