  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether dulaglutide can reduce major cardiovascular
      events and other serious outcomes in persons with type 2 diabetes, when added to their
      anti-hyperglycemic regimen.

    <time_frame>From randomization to first occurrence or death from any cause or study completion (Median Follow-Up of 5.4 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>The time from randomization to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (a composite endpoint) was evaluated using time-to-event analysis. The primary analysis model was a Cox proportional hazards regression model for the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event, with treatment as a fixed effect using the intent-to-treat population. The number of participants who experienced a primary cardiovascular (CV) endpoint event is presented.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Event for Time to First Occurrence After Randomization of Cardiovascular Death, Non-fatal Myocardial Infarction, or Non-fatal Stroke, Individually</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to first occurrence or study completion (Median Follow-Up of 5.4 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>The time from randomization to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (individually) was evaluated using time-to-event analysis via the Cox proportional hazards regression model where response equals treatment. Death from CV causes is defined as a death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, or death due to other CV causes. The number of participants who experienced an event is presented.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization to first occurrence or study completion (Median Follow-Up of 5.4 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>The time from randomization to first occurrence of the composite microvascular endpoint was evaluated using time-to-event analysis via the Cox proportional hazards regression model where response equals treatment. The composite microvascular endpoint is defined as diabetic retinopathy requiring laser therapy, vitrectomy, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (VEGF), clinical proteinuria, a greater than equal ≥ 30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or need for chronic renal replacement therapy. The number of participants who experienced the composite microvascular endpoint event is presented.</description>

    <description>The time to first occurrence after randomization of heart failure requiring hospitalization or an urgent heart failure clinic visit was evaluated using time-to-event analysis via the Cox proportional hazards regression model where response equals treatment. The number of participants who experienced an event is presented.</description>

        <description>The time from randomization to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (individually) was evaluated using time-to-event analysis via the Cox proportional hazards regression model where response equals treatment.

          <description>The time from randomization to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (individually) was evaluated using time-to-event analysis via the Cox proportional hazards regression model where response equals treatment. Death from CV causes is defined as a death resulting from an acute myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death, death due to heart failure, death due to stroke, or death due to other CV causes. The number of participants who experienced an event is presented.</description>
