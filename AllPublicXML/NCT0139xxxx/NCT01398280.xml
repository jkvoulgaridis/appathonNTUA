  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of topical aminocaproic acid on the
      immune system by assessing the levels of antimicrobial peptides in the skin of patients with
      rosacea. It is hypothesized that aminocaproic acid applied topically will alter the body's
      immune system in patients with rosacea by inhibiting activation of antimicrobial peptides.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or non-pregnant female, 18 - 70 years of age.

          -  Subjects willing and able to give informed consent.

          -  Subjects willing and able to comply with the requirements of the study.

          -  Subject has the clinical diagnosis of at least mild/moderate papulopustular rosacea
             (3-20 papulopustules) and at least mild erythema.

          -  Subject has been on a stable dose for greater than 3 months of medications for
             treatment of concurrent medical condition (including oral contraceptive pills,
             vasodilators, adrenergic blocking agents) OR the investigator has determined that the
             medications are unlikely to affect the patient's rosacea and/or treatment during the
             study

          -  Subject is in general good health in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subject has a calculated creatinine clearance 100% of normal range.

          -  Subject has normal baseline labs or in the opinion of the investigator are values are
             not clinically significant and would not inhibit the ability to monitor the patient
             for both safety and efficacy throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of Steroid Rosacea or Pyoderma Faciale (rosacea fulminans)

          -  Subject has a history of Carcinoid, Pheochromocytoma, Serotonin Syndrome or other
             systemic flushing causes.

          -  Subject has used facial topical therapies (OTC drug products or prescription products)
             for any reason within the prior 28 days

          -  Subject has used systemic corticosteroid or systemic antibiotics (especially
             doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, metronidazole) within the prior 28 days.

          -  Subject has had laser or light-based treatment for rosacea within the prior 3 months.

          -  Subject has had systemic retinoids and retinoid derivatives over the past 6 months

          -  Subject has an active or recent history of any coagulation (hyper or hypo) disorder,
             genitourinary bleeding, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis or evidence of
             clinically significant hepatic disease in the opinion of the investigator,

          -  Subject is taking any medicines or supplements that interfere with blood clotting such
             as Coumadin, Plavix, or ASA (&gt;81mg/day).

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity or allergy to aminocaproic acid or components of
             the vehicle.

          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating or planning a pregnancy during the duration of the
             study

          -  Subject has been treated with another investigational device or drug within 28 days
             prior to study enrollment or intends to participate in a clinical trial concurrent
             with this study

          -  Subject has clinically significant findings, medical history or conditions (other than
             rosacea), which in the opinion of the Investigator may compromise the study, treatment
             protocol, or safety of the patient or treatment allocation.
