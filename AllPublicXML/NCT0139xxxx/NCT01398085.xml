      IoN is a phase II/ III trial that will look to ascertain whether or not radio-iodine ablation
      is necessary for low risk differentiated thyroid cancer patients.

      Phase II: to determine if recruitment into a phase III trial is feasible, with a target of 10
      patients per month during a minimum of 6 months (evaluated within months 7-18 of the trial).

      Phase III: to determine whether the 5-year disease-free survival rate among patients who do
      not have routine Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is non-inferior to those who do.

        TNM eligibility is assessed against TNM7 (7th edition 2009) or TNM8 (8th edition 2017, in
        use in the UK from 01/01/2018).

        Eligibility Criteria using TNM7:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histological confirmation of well differentiated thyroid carcinoma: MDT decision for
             inclusion based on overall clinico-pathological assessment is critical.

          -  R0 total thyroidectomy (in one or two stages, no residual disease present; Rx at the
             discretion of the MDT) within the last 6 months

                  at the discretion of the MDT)

        NB: Multifocal tumours (≥2 foci) of all histological types should be designated with &quot;(m)&quot;,
