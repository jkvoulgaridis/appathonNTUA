  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AC220 when
      combined with induction and consolidation therapy and as maintenance therapy following
      induction and consolidation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive escalating doses of AC220 plus standard 7+3 cytarabine and daunorubicin
      remission induction therapy. Subjects may receive up to 2 cycles of induction therapy.
      Subjects who have a complete response (including complete remission (CR) with incomplete
      hematologic recovery) are eligible to receive up to 3 consolidation cycles. In consolidation
      subjects will receive AC220 plus high dose cytarabine. Subjects achieving a composite
      Complete Remission (CRc) will be eligible to receive AC220 alone for up to 12 additional 28
      day cycles.

      Subjects will be enrolled into successive gender balanced cohorts of 6 subjects (at least 3
      must be females) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation decision will
      be made based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur during the first remission
      induction cycle. Seven and 14 day schedules will be evaluated.

      After the MTD and schedule is established, the study will open to enroll between 14 to 34
      subjects. Subjects will receive AC220 during induction and consolidation at the MTD and
      schedule established. Stopping rules will be used to evaluate safety at the current dose. If
      testing at a dose level must be stopped, then a lower dose may be tested. MTD will also be
      established for the maintenance therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of previously-untreated de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
             according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification (2008) documented within
             28 days prior to enrollment and defined as &gt; 20% myeloblasts on the marrow aspirate or
             peripheral blood differential, with or without extramedullary involvement, with
             confirmatory immunophenotyping or immunocytochemistry (e.g. myeloperoxidase). In
             addition, subjects with the clonal, recurring cytogenetic abnormalities:
             t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22) should be considered to have
             AML regardless of the blast percentage. Subjects with both positive and negative
             FMS-like tyrosine kinase - internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation status are
             eligible.

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2.

          -  Subject must have adequate renal, hepatic, and coagulation parameters as indicated by

             partner of childbearing potential who agrees to use a medically-approved method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 3 months after
             the last dose of study drug.

          -  Subject is a WOCBP and has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (sensitivity ≤ 25

             crisis).

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of AML following an antecedent hematologic disorder (diagnosis
             of myelodysplasia or myeloproliferative neoplasm by bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy
             documented at least 12 weeks prior to first dose of study drug).

             of CNS leukemia must undergo a lumbar puncture; and subject with a positive
             cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for AML blasts is not eligible.

          -  Subject has a concurrent disease (e.g. a history of serious organ dysfunction or
             disease) that may place the subject at undue risk to undergo induction therapy per
             protocol, or that might obscure assessments of drug safety.

          -  Subject requires treatment with concomitant drugs that prolong QT/QTc interval or
             strong cytochrome P-3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors or inducers with the exception of
