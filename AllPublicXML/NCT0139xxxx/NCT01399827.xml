    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to a) assess the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the
      treatment of Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) among stimulant treated Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) adults, b) assess the side effect profile of omega-3
      fatty acids in the treatment of DESR among stimulant treated ADHD adults, c) assess effects
      of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on ADHD symptoms and associated features in stimulant
      treated ADHD adults, and d) predict value of fatty acids present in red blood cell membranes.
      This study will be a 12-week trial with adults 18-55 years of age with ADHD and symptoms of
      DESR.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint on the BRIEF-A Emotional Control Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF-A is a 75-item questionnaire that assesses and adult's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions within the past month. The subject rates each question on a 3-point scale (1=Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often). Raw scores are calculated and used to generate T-scores for 8 scales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials), 2 summary index scales (Behavioral Regulation Index and Metacognition Index), and one scale reflecting overall functioning (Global Executive Composite). T-scores range from 30 to 100, with scores ≥65 indicating clinical impairment. A reduction in score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy Measured by Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint on Adult ADHD Investigator Rating Scale (AISRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult ADHD Investigator Rating Scale (AISRS) measures ADHD symptoms in adults. This scale is an investigator rated scale. Higher scores on this scale indicate more severe ADHD-like symptoms. Patients symptoms are rated as &quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, or &quot;very often&quot; by the investigator. Total score ranges from 0 to 54. T-scores range from 30 to 100, with scores ≥65 indicating clinical impairment. A reduction in score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy Measured by Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint on Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a 3-item observer-rated scale that measures illness severity (CGIS), global improvement or change (CGIC) and therapeutic response (CGIE). Scores range from 0 to 7 on each subscale. Total scores range from 0 to 21. T-scores range from 30 to 100, with scores ≥65 indicating clinical impairment. A reduction in score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale is used to rate how serious a mental illness may be. Lower scores on this scale indicate a lower level of functioning and higher severity of symptoms. Total scores range from 0 to 100.</description>

        <description>The BRIEF-A is a 75-item questionnaire that assesses and adult's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions within the past month. The subject rates each question on a 3-point scale (1=Never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often). Raw scores are calculated and used to generate T-scores for 8 scales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials), 2 summary index scales (Behavioral Regulation Index and Metacognition Index), and one scale reflecting overall functioning (Global Executive Composite). T-scores range from 30 to 100, with scores ≥65 indicating clinical impairment. A reduction in score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Adult ADHD Investigator Rating Scale (AISRS) measures ADHD symptoms in adults. This scale is an investigator rated scale. Higher scores on this scale indicate more severe ADHD-like symptoms.

T-scores range from 30 to 100, with scores ≥65 indicating clinical impairment. A reduction in score indicates improvement.</description>
