      The purpose of this study is to a) evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids versus
      inositol in the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder, b) evaluate the efficacy of omega-3
      fatty acid plus inositol in the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder, and c) assess the
      side effect profile of omega-3 fatty acids plus inositol. This study will be a 12-week trial
      with children ages 5-12 years old with bipolar spectrum disorders.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, double blind, controlled trial that will
      evaluate effectiveness and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids and inositol used alone and in
      combination. The investigators plan to decrease the variability in the population under study
      by limiting the age range to 5-12 years and excluding cases with significant, untreated,
      comorbidity. The cognitive effects/side effects with a neuropsychological battery pre and
      post treatment will be measured. Subjects with a history of failing treatment with two or
      more conventional treatments will be excluded.

      This will be a 12-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial study to compare efficacy and
      tolerability of the natural treatments omega-3 fatty acids and inositol used in combination
      in the treatment of bipolar spectrum disorders in children and adolescents (ages 5-12).
      Subjects will be randomized in double blind fashion to one of three arms: omega-3 fatty
      acids, inositol or the combined treatment. Further, the proposed study will include measures
      of cognition prior to starting study medication and at endpoint. The investigators will
      minimize the variability of the population under study by limiting the age range to 5-12
      years, minimizing untreated or clinically significant comorbidity and excluding subjects who
      have already failed treatment with 2 or more anti-manic agents. Subjects will include youth
      ages 5-12 years with a bipolar spectrum disorder (type I, II, or NOS), mixed, manic, or
      hypomanic state, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
      Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) (DSM-IV), randomized to 3 treatment
      arms: 1) treatment with omega-3 fatty acids (N=20); 2) treatment with inositol (N=20); 3)
      treatment with the combination of inositol and omega-3 fatty acids (N=20).

    <time_frame>Baseline to endpoint (12 weeks or last observation carried forward if dropped prior to week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) consists of 7 items rated on a scale from 0 (symptoms not present) to 4 (symptoms extremely severe) and 4 items rated on a scale from 0 (symptom not present) to 8 (symptom extremely severe).The YMRS score ranges from 0-60. Questions are asked about the last week. A higher score signifies more severe manic symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Depression Symptoms by Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to endpoint (12 weeks or last observation carried forward if dropped prior to week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) is a clinician-rated instrument with 17 items scored on a 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 scale. A rating of 1 indicates normal, thus the minimum score is 17. The maximum score is 113. Scores of 20-30 suggest borderline depression. Scores of 40-60 indicate moderate depression.</description>
