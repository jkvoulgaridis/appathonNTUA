  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial examines whether programs aimed at matching resources to
      patient hypertension (i.e. high blood pressure) control lead to greater reduction in systolic
      blood pressure (top number of blood pressure reading) than simply having maintenance phone
      calls in addition to usual care. Answering this question will provide important evidence
      concerning the overall goal of sustained long-term implementation of the disease management
      programs as part of patient aligned care teams in the Veterans Affairs and other healthcare
      systems.

      Project Objectives: The investigators are conducting a two-arm 18-month randomized clinical
      trial for patients with pharmaceutically treated hypertension for which systolic BP is not
      controlled (&gt;/=140 mmHg for non-diabetic or &gt;/=130 mmHg for diabetic patients). The primary
      aim will be to compare two treatment arms/strategies in terms of impact on systolic BP
      control: Arm 1 - An intervention arm using titrated disease management in which patients'
      hypertension control, assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, will be used to decide the
      resource intensity of strategies: 1) Medium/level 1 resource intensity strategy: a registered
      nurse will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring;
      2) High/level 2 resource intensity strategy: a pharmacist will provide monthly tailored
      behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring + pharmacist-directed medication
      management; and 3) Booster (low) resource intensity strategy: a license practice nurse (LPN)
      will provide bi-monthly, non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls to patients whose
      systolic BP comes under control. Arm 2 - A control arm, in which an LPN will provide
      bi-monthly non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls (same procedures as the booster
      (low) resource intensity strategy component of the titrated intervention).

    <time_frame>Over 18 months of study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>One of our secondary research questions was: &quot;If the intervention results in greater reduction in SBP than the control group, is it cost effective?&quot;
Intervention results did not show statistically significant differences between arms, therefore cost effectiveness analysis was not appropriate.
While cost effectiveness was not analyzed because it was a null trial, the investigators would have used resource utilization and cost data from VA data sets to measure VA outpatient and inpatient utilization and costs by arms over 18 months. The investigators would have examined hypertension-related outpatient pharmacy prescription counts and costs in order to compare them to total outpatient pharmacy costs and the investigators would have examined inpatient utilization and costs.</description>

Sometimes if you feel worse when you take your blood pressure medicine, do you stop taking it? The scale is a Yes(0) or No (1) answer.

        <title>Cost Effectiveness</title>
        <description>One of our secondary research questions was: &quot;If the intervention results in greater reduction in SBP than the control group, is it cost effective?&quot;
Intervention results did not show statistically significant differences between arms, therefore cost effectiveness analysis was not appropriate.
While cost effectiveness was not analyzed because it was a null trial, the investigators would have used resource utilization and cost data from VA data sets to measure VA outpatient and inpatient utilization and costs by arms over 18 months. The investigators would have examined hypertension-related outpatient pharmacy prescription counts and costs in order to compare them to total outpatient pharmacy costs and the investigators would have examined inpatient utilization and costs.</description>

          <title>Titration Intervention</title>
          <description>The intervention arm includes three levels of resource intensity targeted to improve patients' systolic blood pressure (SBP) [top number of blood pressure measurement].
Medium/level 1 resource intensity: a registered nurse (RN) will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring.
High/level 2 resource intensity: a pharmacist will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring + pharmacist-directed medication management.
Booster (low) resource intensity: a licensed practical nurse (LPN) will provide non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls every two months to patients whose SBP comes under control.
Booster/ low resource: A LPN will provide behavioral support telephone calls that do not include goal setting and directed problem solving every two months.</description>

          <description>A LPN will provide behavioral support telephone calls that do not include goal setting and directed problem solving every two months (identical to booster (low) resource intensity component of the titrated intervention). The control arm will utilize the same procedures as the booster level for intervention patients for whom SBP comes under control.
