      The investigators hypothesize that nebivolol will reduce ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone
      in adult humans with elevated blood pressure to a greater extent than either metoprolol or
      placebo.

      1. The investigators hypothesize that nebivolol will reduce ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor
           tone in adult humans with elevated blood pressure to a greater extent than either
           metoprolol or placebo.

        2. The investigators further hypothesize that reducing ET-1 vasoconstrictor activity
           contributes to the improvement in endothelial vasodilator function associated with
           nebivolol.

    <measure>Percent Change in Forearm Blood Flow (FBF) Response to BQ-123 (100 Nmol/Min)</measure>
    <time_frame>Forearm blood flow was measured at 0-60 minutes before the 12 week drug or placebo intervention and 0-60 minutes after the 12 week drug or placebo intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured via strain-gauge venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and every 10 minutes thereafter for 60 minutes. The average percent change for before and after either drug or placebo was calculated as the FBF at (each time point-resting value)/resting value and multiplied by 100 to calculate the percent change. The baseline or resting value was measured before the start of each drug infusion.</description>

             of 80-proof distilled spirits)

          -  Potential candidates who are taking cardiovascular-acting (i.e. statins, blood
             pressure medication an aspirin) medications will not be eligible.

          -  Fasting plasma glucose &gt;126 mg/dL.

        <description>Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured via strain-gauge venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and every 10 minutes thereafter for 60 minutes. The average percent change for before and after either drug or placebo was calculated as the FBF at (each time point-resting value)/resting value and multiplied by 100 to calculate the percent change. The baseline or resting value was measured before the start of each drug infusion.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in FBF Response to BQ-123 (100 Nmol/Min) + BQ-788 (50 Nmol/Min)</title>
        <description>Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured via strain-gauge venous occlusion plethysmography at rest and every 10 minutes thereafter for 60 minutes. The average percent change for before and after either drug or placebo was calculated as the FBF at (each time point-resting value)/resting value and multiplied by 100 to calculate the percent change. The baseline or resting value was measured before the start of each drug infusion.</description>
        <time_frame>Forearm blood flow was measured 0-120 minutes before the 12 week drug or placebo intervention and 0-120 minutes after the 12 week drug or placebo intervention.</time_frame>
