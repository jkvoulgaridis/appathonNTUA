  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (transplant of blood cells from another individual) is a
      treatment option for patients with myelodysplasia or myeloproliferative Disorders. During the
      course of this study, it will be evaluated whether a particular type of blood cell, called a
      cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell, may add benefit to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
      CIK cells are present in small quantities in the bloodstream but their numbers can be
      expanded after a brief period of nurturing in a laboratory.

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the rate of conversion to FDC following infusion of allogeneic CIK cells among
      patients with MDS, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, or MPD who receive non myeloablative
      preparative regimen of TLI / ATG followed by allogeneic HCT and consolidation with allogeneic
      CIK cells.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the 2 year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS)

        -  To determine the incidence of acute GVHD following infusion of allogeneic CIK cells

        -  To assess the pre-transplant expression of NKG2D ligands in patients' bone marrow
           aspirates.

    <description>Proportion of patients achieving full donor T-cell chimerism (FDC) by on or before Day 90 post non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant with allogeneic cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells will be determined. FDC is defined as the attainment of &gt;95% donor type CD3+ cells. The outcome will be reported as number of participants who achieved full donor chimerism, a number without dispersion.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is an expression of the number of participants that remain alive 2 years after cytokine-induced killer (CIK) infusion. The outcome will be reported as the number of participants alive 2 years after CIK infusion, a number without dispersion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-free Survival (EFS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Event-free Survival (EFS) rate will be assessed on all enrolled participants and is defined as the duration of time after cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell infusion that the participants remain alive with experiencing relapse, Grade 3 to 4 acute graft vs host disease (aGVHD), or death. The outcome will be reported as the number of participants, stratified by receipt of CIK cells, that did not experience a specified event, a number without dispersion.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Acute graft vs host disease (aGvHD) Grade 2 to 4 was staged &amp; graded using modified Keystone criteria, as below. The outcome is reported as the number of participants that experience Grade 2 to 4 aGvHD within 100 days and 1 year.
Stage 1: Skin: rash &lt; 25% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 2 to 3 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea 500 to 1000 mL/day or persistent nausea with positive biopsy for GvHD
Stage 2: Skin: rash 25 to 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 3 to 6 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea 1000 to 1500 mL/day.
Stage 3: Skin: rash &gt; 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 6 to 15 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea &gt; 1500 mL/day.
Stage 4: Skin: generalized erythroderma with bulla formation. Liver: bilirubin &gt; 15 mg/dL. Gut: severe abdominal pain with or without ileus Grade of aGvHD was determined as follows.
Grade 1: Stage 1-2 Skin + No Liver stage + No Gut stage
Grade 2: Stage 3 Skin OR Stage 1 Liver or Stage 1 Gut
Grade 3: No Skin stage + Stage 2 to 3 Liver Stage 2 to 4 Gut
Grade 4: Stage 4 Skin + or Stage 2</description>

    <description>Pre-transplant expression of natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) ligands MIC A, MIC B, and the UL16 binding proteins (ULBPs) will be assessed in participants' bone marrow aspirates. The outcomes is expressed as the number of participants whose expression level for each ligand was elevated compared to background, represented by the known levels for individual without cancer.</description>
