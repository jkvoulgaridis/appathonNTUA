    <description>Laboratory-confirmed dengue infection refers to suspected symptomatic dengue cases with positive dengue virus identification or serologic evidence of dengue infection through dengue virus identification through Reverse Transcriptase quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) from first blood sample or anti-dengue Immunoglobulin type M/G (IgM/G) seroconversions between first and second blood sampling. Note: In the study report the denominator for incidence estimation has not been expressed as an absolute number of subjects, but in person-years. Therefore, the category &quot;number of subjects analysed&quot; has been populated with the number of enrolled subjects attended the study visit after the specified season and in each age stratum.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Prevalence of Past Dengue Infection (Dengue Seroprevalence) at Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 (At enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures the occurrence of past dengue infections among subjects who had laboratory results. Proportion was estimated from logistic generalized estimating equations models (GEE) taking the clustering effect of the school into account and was presented per subject enrolment age. Immune response against dengue was assessed via Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).</description>

    <description>Asymptomatic dengue primary infection was defined as a documented seroconversion (anti-dengue IgG antibodies) between two sequential sera samples obtained during the scheduled visits, without suspicion of dengue. Proportion of asymptomatic dengue primary infection was analyzed among subjects who had no past dengue infection reported before the beginning of the period.</description>

    <description>A case of primary or secondary symptomatic dengue infection was defined as laboratory confirmed or probable symptomatic dengue case whose previous sample collected at scheduled Visits 1- 4 (Day 0- Year 3) to detect anti-dengue IgG antibodies was seronegative or seropositive, respectively. A probable dengue case was defined as a suspected symptomatic dengue case with the following laboratory findings: -anti-dengue IgM or anti-dengue IgG positivity in at least one sample (in either blood sample 1 or 2) AND no evidence of viremia (negative dengue virus identification through RT-qPCR) in blood sample 1 AND no evidence of anti-dengue Ig M or IgG seroconversion between blood sample 1 and blood sample 2.</description>

        <description>A case of primary or secondary symptomatic dengue infection was defined as laboratory confirmed or probable symptomatic dengue case whose previous sample collected at scheduled Visits 1- 4 (Day 0- Year 3) to detect anti-dengue IgG antibodies was seronegative or seropositive, respectively. A probable dengue case was defined as a suspected symptomatic dengue case with the following laboratory findings: -anti-dengue IgM or anti-dengue IgG positivity in at least one sample (in either blood sample 1 or 2) AND no evidence of viremia (negative dengue virus identification through RT-qPCR) in blood sample 1 AND no evidence of anti-dengue Ig M or IgG seroconversion between blood sample 1 and blood sample 2.</description>

Therefore the category &quot;number of subjects analysed&quot; has been populated with the number of enrolled subjects seronegative for anti-dengue IgG antibodies before the specified season and attended the study visit after the specified season, and in each age stratum.</description>
